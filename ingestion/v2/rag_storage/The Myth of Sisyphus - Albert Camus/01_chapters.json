    "raw_text": "PREFACE\nFOR ME “The Myth of Sisyphus” marks the beginning of an idea which I\nwas to pursue in The Rebel. It attempts to resolve the problem of suicide,\nas The Rebel attempts to resolve that of murder, in both cases without\nthe aid of eternal values which, temporarily perhaps, are absent or\ndistorted in contemporary Europe. The fundamental subject of “The\nMyth of Sisyphus” is this: it is legitimate and necessary to wonder\nwhether life has a meaning; therefore it is legitimate to meet the problem\nof suicide face to face. The answer, underlying and appearing through\nthe paradoxes which cover it, is this: even if one does not believe in God,\nsuicide is not legitimate. Written \u0000fteen years ago, in 1940, amid the\nFrench and European disaster, this book declares that even within the\nlimits of nihilism it is possible to \u0000nd the means to proceed beyond\nnihilism. In all the books I have written since, I have attempted to pursue\nthis direction. Although “The Myth of Sisyphus” poses mortal problems, it\nsums itself up for me as a lucid invitation to live and to create, in the\nvery midst of the desert.\nIt has hence been thought possible to append to this philosophical\nargument a series of essays, of a kind I have never ceased writing, which\nare somewhat marginal to my other books. In a more lyrical form, they\nall illustrate that essential \u0000uctuation from assent to refusal which, in my\nview, de\u0000nes the artist and his di\u0000cult calling. The unity of this book,\nthat I should like to be apparent to American readers as it is to me,\nresides in the re\u0000ection, alternately cold and impassioned, in which an\nartist may indulge as to his reasons for living and for creating. After\n\u0000fteen years I have progressed beyond several of the positions which are\nset down here; but I have remained faithful, it seems to me, to the\nexigency which prompted them. That is why this book is in a certain\nsense the most personal of those I have published in America. More than\n\f\nthe others, therefore, it has need of the indulgence and understanding of\nits readers.\nALBERT CAMUS\nPARIS\nMARCH 1955"

    "raw_text": "THE MYTH OF SISYPHUS\nfor\n              PASCAL PIA\n\f\nO my soul, do not aspire to immortal life, but exhaust the limits of the\npossible.\n—Pindar, Pythian iii\nTHE PAGES that follow deal with an absurd sensitivity that can be found\nwidespread in the age—and not with an absurd philosophy which\nour time, properly speaking, has not known. It is therefore simply\nfair to point out, at the outset, what these pages owe to certain\ncontemporary thinkers. It is so far from my intention to hide this\nthat they will be found cited and commented upon throughout this\nwork.\nBut it is useful to note at the same time that the absurd, hitherto\ntaken as a conclusion, is considered in this essay as a starting-point.\nIn this sense it may be said that there is something provisional in\nmy commentary: one cannot prejudge the position it entails. There\nwill be found here merely the description, in the pure state, of an\nintellectual malady. No metaphysic, no belief is involved in it for\nthe moment. These are the limits and the only bias of this book.\nCertain personal experiences urge me to make this clear.\n\f\nT\nAN ABSURD REASONING\nAbsurdity and Suicide\nHERE is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that\nis suicide. Judging whether life is or is not worth living\namounts to answering the fundamental question of philosophy. All\nthe rest—whether or not the world has three dimensions, whether\nthe mind has nine or twelve categories—comes afterwards. These\nare games; one must \u0000rst answer. And if it is true, as Nietzsche\nclaims, that a philosopher, to deserve our respect, must preach by\nexample, you can appreciate the importance of that reply, for it will\nprecede the de\u0000nitive act. These are facts the heart can feel; yet\nthey call for careful study before they become clear to the intellect.\nIf I ask myself how to judge that this question is more urgent\nthan that, I reply that one judges by the actions it entails. I have\nnever seen anyone die for the ontological argument. Galileo, who\nheld a scienti\u0000c truth of great importance, abjured it with the\ngreatest ease as soon as it endangered his life. In a certain sense, he\ndid right.1 That truth was not worth the stake. Whether the earth or\nthe sun revolves around the other is a matter of profound\nindi\u0000erence. To tell the truth, it is a futile question. On the other\nhand, I see many people die because they judge that life is not\nworth living. I see others paradoxically getting killed for the ideas\nor illusions that give them a reason for living (what is called a\nreason for living is also an excellent reason for dying). I therefore\nconclude that the meaning of life is the most urgent of questions.\nHow to answer it? On all essential problems (I mean thereby those\nthat run the risk of leading to death or those that intensify the\npassion of living) there are probably but two methods of thought:\nthe method of La Palisse and the method of Don Quixote. Solely the\nbalance between evidence and lyricism can allow us to achieve\n\f\nsimultaneously emotion and lucidity. In a subject at once so humble\nand so heavy with emotion, the learned and classical dialectic must\nyield, one can see, to a more modest attitude of mind deriving at\none and the same time from common sense and understanding.\nSuicide has never been dealt with except as a social phenomenon.\nOn the contrary, we are concerned here, at the outset, with the\nrelationship between individual thought and suicide. An act like this\nis prepared within the silence of the heart, as is a great work of art.\nThe man himself is ignorant of it. One evening he pulls the trigger\nor jumps. Of an apartment-building manager who had killed himself\nI was told that he had lost his daughter \u0000ve years before, that he\nhad changed greatly since, and that that experience had\n“undermined” him. A more exact word cannot be imagined.\nBeginning to think is beginning to be undermined. Society has but\nlittle connection with such beginnings. The worm is in man’s heart.\nThat is where it must be sought. One must follow and understand\nthis fatal game that leads from lucidity in the face of existence to\n\u0000ight from light.\nThere are many causes for a suicide, and generally the most\nobvious ones were not the most powerful. Rarely is suicide\ncommitted (yet the hypothesis is not excluded) through re\u0000ection.\nWhat sets o\u0000 the crisis is almost always unveri\u0000able. Newspapers\noften speak of “personal sorrows” or of “incurable illness.” These\nexplanations are plausible. But one would have to know whether a\nfriend of the desperate man had not that very day addressed him\nindi\u0000erently. He is the guilty one. For that is enough to precipitate\nall the rancors and all the boredom still in suspension.2\nBut if it is hard to \u0000x the precise instant, the subtle step when the\nmind opted for death, it is easier to deduce from the act itself the\nconsequences it implies. In a sense, and as in melodrama, killing\nyourself amounts to confessing. It is confessing that life is too much\nfor you or that you do not understand it. Let’s not go too far in such\nanalogies, however, but rather return to everyday words. It is\nmerely confessing that that “is not worth the trouble.” Living,\nnaturally, is never easy. You continue making the gestures\ncommanded by existence for many reasons, the \u0000rst of which is\n\f\nhabit. Dying voluntarily implies that you have recognized, even\ninstinctively, the ridiculous character of that habit, the absence of\nany profound reason for living, the insane character of that daily\nagitation, and the uselessness of su\u0000ering.\nWhat, then, is that incalculable feeling that deprives the mind of\nthe sleep necessary to life? A world that can be explained even with\nbad reasons is a familiar world. But, on the other hand, in a\nuniverse suddenly divested of illusions and lights, man feels an\nalien, a stranger. His exile is without remedy since he is deprived of\nthe memory of a lost home or the hope of a promised land. This\ndivorce between man and his life, the actor and his setting, is\nproperly the feeling of absurdity. All healthy men having thought of\ntheir own suicide, it can be seen, without further explanation, that\nthere is a direct connection between this feeling and the longing for\ndeath.\nThe subject of this essay is precisely this relationship between the\nabsurd and suicide, the exact degree to which suicide is a solution to\nthe absurd. The principle can be established that for a man who\ndoes not cheat, what he believes to be true must determine his\naction. Belief in the absurdity of existence must then dictate his\nconduct. It is legitimate to wonder, clearly and without false pathos,\nwhether a conclusion of this importance requires forsaking as\nrapidly as possible an incomprehensible condition. I am speaking, of\ncourse, of men inclined to be in harmony with themselves.\nStated clearly, this problem may seem both simple and insoluble.\nBut it is wrongly assumed that simple questions involve answers\nthat are no less simple and that evidence implies evidence. A priori\nand reversing the terms of the problem, just as one does or does not\nkill oneself, it seems that there are but two philosophical solutions,\neither yes or no. This would be too easy. But allowance must be\nmade for those who, without concluding, continue questioning.\nHere I am only slightly indulging in irony: this is the majority. I\nnotice also that those who answer “no” act as if they thought “yes.”\nAs a matter of fact, if I accept the Nietzschean criterion, they think\n“yes” in one way or another. On the other hand, it often happens\nthat those who commit suicide were assured of the meaning of life.\n\f\nThese contradictions are constant. It may even be said that they\nhave never been so keen as on this point where, on the contrary,\nlogic seems so desirable. It is a commonplace to compare\nphilosophical theories and the behavior of those who profess them.\nBut it must be said that of the thinkers who refused a meaning to\nlife none except Kirilov who belongs to literature, Peregrinos who is\nborn of legend,3 and Jules Lequier who belongs to hypothesis,\nadmitted his logic to the point of refusing that life. Schopenhauer is\noften cited, as a \u0000t subject for laughter, because he praised suicide\nwhile seated at a well-set table. This is no subject for joking. That\nway of not taking the tragic seriously is not so grievous, but it helps\nto judge a man.\nIn the face of such contradictions and obscurities must we\nconclude that there is no relationship between the opinion one has\nabout life and the act one commits to leave it? Let us not\nexaggerate in this direction. In a man’s attachment to life there is\nsomething stronger than all the ills in the world. The body’s\njudgment is as good as the mind’s, and the body shrinks from\nannihilation. We get into the habit of living before acquiring the\nhabit of thinking. In that race which daily hastens us toward death,\nthe body maintains its irreparable lead. In short, the essence of that\ncontradiction lies in what I shall call the act of eluding because it is\nboth less and more than diversion in the Pascalian sense. Eluding is\nthe invariable game. The typical act of eluding, the fatal evasion\nthat constitutes the third theme of this essay, is hope. Hope of\nanother life one must “deserve” or trickery of those who live not for\nlife itself but for some great idea that will transcend it, re\u0000ne it,\ngive it a meaning, and betray it.\nThus everything contributes to spreading confusion. Hitherto, and\nit has not been wasted e\u0000ort, people have played on words and\npretended to believe that refusing to grant a meaning to life\nnecessarily leads to declaring that it is not worth living. In truth,\nthere is no necessary common measure between these two\njudgments. One merely has to refuse to be misled by the confusions,\ndivorces, and inconsistencies previously pointed out. One must\nbrush everything aside and go straight to the real problem. One"

    "raw_text": "kills oneself because life is not worth living, that is certainly a truth\n—yet an unfruitful one because it is a truism. But does that insult to\nexistence, that \u0000at denial in which it is plunged come from the fact\nthat it has no meaning? Does its absurdity require one to escape it\nthrough hope or suicide—this is what must be clari\u0000ed, hunted\ndown, and elucidated while brushing aside all the rest. Does the\nAbsurd dictate death? This problem must be given priority over\nothers, outside all methods of thought and all exercises of the\ndisinterested mind. Shades of meaning, contradictions, the\npsychology that an “objective” mind can always introduce into all\nproblems have no place in this pursuit and this passion. It calls\nsimply for an unjust—in other words, logical—thought. That is not\neasy. It is always easy to be logical. It is almost impossible to be\nlogical to the bitter end. Men who die by their own hand\nconsequently follow to its conclusion their emotional inclination.\nRe\u0000ection on suicide gives me an opportunity to raise the only\nproblem to interest me: is there a logic to the point of death? I\ncannot know unless I pursue, without reckless passion, in the sole\nlight of evidence, the reasoning of which I am here suggesting the\nsource. This is what I call an absurd reasoning. Many have begun it.\nI do not yet know whether or not they kept to it.\nWhen Karl Jaspers, revealing the impossibility of constituting the\nworld as a unity, exclaims: “This limitation leads me to myself,\nwhere I can no longer withdraw behind an objective point of view\nthat I am merely representing, where neither I myself nor the\nexistence of others can any longer become an object for me,” he is\nevoking after many others those waterless deserts where thought\nreaches its con\u0000nes. After many others, yes indeed, but how eager\nthey were to get out of them! At that last crossroad where thought\nhesitates, many men have arrived and even some of the humblest.\nThey then abdicated what was most precious to them, their life.\nOthers, princes of the mind, abdicated likewise, but they initiated\nthe suicide of their thought in its purest revolt. The real e\u0000ort is to\nstay there, rather, in so far as that is possible, and to examine\nclosely the odd vegetation of those distant regions. Tenacity and\nacumen are privileged spectators of this inhuman show in which\n\f\nabsurdity, hope, and death carry on their dialogue. The mind can\nthen analyze the \u0000gures of that elementary yet subtle dance before\nillustrating them and reliving them itself.\nAbsurd Walls\nLike great works, deep feelings always mean more than they are\nconscious of saying. The regularity of an impulse or a repulsion in a\nsoul is encountered again in habits of doing or thinking, is\nreproduced in consequences of which the soul itself knows nothing.\nGreat feelings take with them their own universe, splendid or\nabject. They light up with their passion an exclusive world in which\nthey recognize their climate. There is a universe of jealousy, of\nambition, of sel\u0000shness, or of generosity. A universe—in other\nwords, a metaphysic and an attitude of mind. What is true of\nalready specialized feelings will be even more so of emotions\nbasically as indeterminate, simultaneously as vague and as\n“de\u0000nite,” as remote and as “present” as those furnished us by\nbeauty or aroused by absurdity.\nAt any streetcorner the feeling of absurdity can strike any man in\nthe face. As it is, in its distressing nudity, in its light without\ne\u0000ulgence, it is elusive. But that very di\u0000culty deserves re\u0000ection.\nIt is probably true that a man remains forever unknown to us and\nthat there is in him something irreducible that escapes us. But\npractically I know men and recognize them by their behavior, by the\ntotality of their deeds, by the consequences caused in life by their\npresence. Likewise, all those irrational feelings which o\u0000er no\npurchase to analysis. I can de\u0000ne them practically, appreciate them\npractically, by gathering together the sum of their consequences in\nthe domain of the intelligence, by seizing and noting all their\naspects, by outlining their universe. It is certain that apparently,\nthough I have seen the same actor a hundred times, I shall not for\nthat reason know him any better personally. Yet if I add up the\nheroes he has personi\u0000ed and if I say that I know him a little better\nat the hundredth character counted o\u0000, this will be felt to contain\n\f\nan element of truth. For this apparent paradox is also an apologue.\nThere is a moral to it. It teaches that a man de\u0000nes himself by his\nmake-believe as well as by his sincere impulses. There is thus a\nlower key of feelings, inaccessible in the heart but partially\ndisclosed by the acts they imply and the attitudes of mind they\nassume. It is clear that in this way I am de\u0000ning a method. But it is\nalso evident that that method is one of analysis and not of\nknowledge. For methods imply metaphysics; unconsciously they\ndisclose conclusions that they often claim not to know yet.\nSimilarly, the last pages of a book are already contained in the \u0000rst\npages. Such a link is inevitable. The method de\u0000ned here\nacknowledges the feeling that all true knowledge is impossible.\nSolely appearances can be enumerated and the climate make itself\nfelt.\nPerhaps we shall be able to overtake that elusive feeling of\nabsurdity in the di\u0000erent but closely related worlds of intelligence,\nof the art of living, or of art itself. The climate of absurdity is in the\nbeginning. The end is the absurd universe and that attitude of mind\nwhich lights the world with its true colors to bring out the\nprivileged and implacable visage which that attitude has discerned\nin it.\n* * *\nAll great deeds and all great thoughts have a ridiculous\nbeginning. Great works are often born on a streetcorner or in a\nrestaurant’s revolving door. So it is with absurdity. The absurd\nworld more than others derives its nobility from that abject birth. In\ncertain situations, replying “nothing” when asked what one is\nthinking about may be pretense in a man. Those who are loved are\nwell aware of this. But if that reply is sincere, if it symbolizes that\nodd state of soul in which the void becomes eloquent, in which the\nchain of daily gestures is broken, in which the heart vainly seeks the\nlink that will connect it again, then it is as it were the \u0000rst sign of\nabsurdity.\n\f\nIt happens that the stage sets collapse. Rising, streetcar, four\nhours in the o\u0000ce or the factory, meal, streetcar, four hours of\nwork, meal, sleep, and Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday\nFriday and Saturday according to the same rhythm—this path is\neasily followed most of the time. But one day the “why” arises and\neverything begins in that weariness tinged with amazement.\n“Begins”—this is important. Weariness comes at the end of the acts\nof a mechanical life, but at the same time it inaugurates the impulse\nof consciousness. It awakens consciousness and provokes what\nfollows. What follows is the gradual return into the chain or it is the\nde\u0000nitive awakening. At the end of the awakening comes, in time,\nthe consequence: suicide or recovery. In itself weariness has\nsomething sickening about it. Here, I must conclude that it is good.\nFor everything begins with consciousness and nothing is worth\nanything except through it. There is nothing original about these\nremarks. But they are obvious; that is enough for a while, during a\nsketchy reconnaissance in the origins of the absurd. Mere “anxiety,”\nas Heidegger says, is at the source of everything.\nLikewise and during every day of an unillustrious life, time\ncarries us. But a moment always comes when we have to carry it.\nWe live on the future: “tomorrow,” “later on,” “when you have\nmade your way,” “you will understand when you are old enough.”\nSuch irrelevancies are wonderful, for, after all, it’s a matter of\ndying. Yet a day comes when a man notices or says that he is thirty.\nThus he asserts his youth. But simultaneously he situates himself in\nrelation to time. He takes his place in it. He admits that he stands at\na certain point on a curve that he acknowledges having to travel to\nits end. He belongs to time, and by the horror that seizes him, he\nrecognizes his worst enemy. Tomorrow, he was longing for\ntomorrow, whereas everything in him ought to reject it. That revolt\nof the \u0000esh is the absurd.4\nA step lower and strangeness creeps in: perceiving that the world\nis “dense,” sensing to what a degree a stone is foreign and\nirreducible to us, with what intensity nature or a landscape can\nnegate us. At the heart of all beauty lies something inhuman, and\nthese hills, the softness of the sky, the outline of these trees at this\n\f\nvery minute lose the illusory meaning with which we had clothed\nthem, henceforth more remote than a lost paradise. The primitive\nhostility of the world rises up to face us across millennia. For a\nsecond we cease to understand it because for centuries we have\nunderstood in it solely the images and designs that we had\nattributed to it beforehand, because henceforth we lack the power\nto make use of that arti\u0000ce. The world evades us because it\nbecomes itself again. That stage scenery masked by habit becomes\nagain what it is. It withdraws at a distance from us. Just as there\nare days when under the familiar face of a woman, we see as a\nstranger her we had loved months or years ago, perhaps we shall\ncome even to desire what suddenly leaves us so alone. But the time\nhas not yet come. Just one thing: that denseness and that\nstrangeness of the world is the absurd.\nMen, too, secrete the inhuman. At certain moments of lucidity,\nthe mechanical aspect of their gestures, their meaningless\npantomime makes silly everything that surrounds them. A man is\ntalking on the telephone behind a glass partition; you cannot hear\nhim, but you see his incomprehensible dumb show: you wonder\nwhy he is alive. This discomfort in the face of man’s own\ninhumanity, this incalculable tumble before the image of what we\nare, this “nausea,” as a writer of today calls it, is also the absurd.\nLikewise the stranger who at certain seconds comes to meet us in a\nmirror, the familiar and yet alarming brother we encounter in our\nown photographs is also the absurd.\nI come at last to death and to the attitude we have toward it. On\nthis point everything has been said and it is only proper to avoid\npathos. Yet one will never be su\u0000ciently surprised that everyone\nlives as if no one “knew.” This is because in reality there is no\nexperience of death. Properly speaking, nothing has been\nexperienced but what has been lived and made conscious. Here, it is\nbarely possible to speak of the experience of others’ deaths. It is a\nsubstitute, an illusion, and it never quite convinces us. That\nmelancholy convention cannot be persuasive. The horror comes in\nreality from the mathematical aspect of the event. If time frightens\nus, this is because it works out the problem and the solution comes\n\f\nafterward. All the pretty speeches about the soul will have their\ncontrary convincingly proved, at least for a time. From this inert\nbody on which a slap makes no mark the soul has disappeared. This\nelementary and de\u0000nitive aspect of the adventure constitutes the\nabsurd feeling. Under the fatal lighting of that destiny, its\nuselessness becomes evident. No code of ethics and no e\u0000ort are\njusti\u0000able a priori in the face of the cruel mathematics that\ncommand our condition.\nLet me repeat: all this has been said over and over. I am limiting\nmyself here to making a rapid classi\u0000cation and to pointing out\nthese obvious themes. They run through all literatures and all\nphilosophies. Everyday conversation feeds on them. There is no\nquestion of reinventing them. But it is essential to be sure of these\nfacts in order to be able to question oneself subsequently on the\nprimordial question. I am interested—let me repeat again—not so\nmuch in absurd discoveries as in their consequences. If one is\nassured of these facts, what is one to conclude, how far is one to go\nto elude nothing? Is one to die voluntarily or to hope in spite of\neverything? Beforehand, it is necessary to take the same rapid\ninventory on the plane of the intelligence.\n* * *\nThe mind’s \u0000rst step is to distinguish what is true from what is\nfalse. However, as soon as thought re\u0000ects on itself, what it \u0000rst\ndiscovers is a contradiction. Useless to strive to be convincing in\nthis case. Over the centuries no one has furnished a clearer and\nmore elegant demonstration of the business than Aristotle: “The\noften ridiculed consequence of these opinions is that they destroy\nthemselves. For by asserting that all is true we assert the truth of\nthe contrary assertion and consequently the falsity of our own thesis\n(for the contrary assertion does not admit that it can be true). And\nif one says that all is false, that assertion is itself false. If we declare\nthat solely the assertion opposed to ours is false or else that solely\nours is not false, we are nevertheless forced to admit an in\u0000nite\nnumber of true or false judgments. For the one who expresses a true\n\f\nassertion proclaims simultaneously that it is true, and so on ad\nin\u0000nitum.”\nThis vicious circle is but the \u0000rst of a series in which the mind\nthat studies itself gets lost in a giddy whirling. The very simplicity\nof these paradoxes makes them irreducible. Whatever may be the\nplays on words and the acrobatics of logic, to understand is, above\nall, to unify. The mind’s deepest desire, even in its most elaborate\noperations, parallels man’s unconscious feeling in the face of his\nuniverse: it is an insistence upon familiarity, an appetite for clarity.\nUnderstanding the world for a man is reducing it to the human,\nstamping it with his seal. The cat’s universe is not the universe of\nthe anthill. The truism “All thought is anthropomorphic” has no\nother meaning. Likewise, the mind that aims to understand reality\ncan consider itself satis\u0000ed only by reducing it to terms of thought.\nIf man realized that the universe like him can love and su\u0000er, he\nwould be reconciled. If thought discovered in the shimmering\nmirrors of phenomena eternal relations capable of summing them\nup and summing themselves up in a single principle, then would be\nseen an intellectual joy of which the myth of the blessed would be\nbut a ridiculous imitation. That nostalgia for unity, that appetite for\nthe absolute illustrates the essential impulse of the human drama.\nBut the fact of that nostalgia’s existence does not imply that it is to\nbe immediately satis\u0000ed. For if, bridging the gulf that separates\ndesire from conquest, we assert with Parmenides the reality of the\nOne (whatever it may be), we fall into the ridiculous contradiction\nof a mind that asserts total unity and proves by its very assertion its\nown di\u0000erence and the diversity it claimed to resolve. This other\nvicious circle is enough to sti\u0000e our hopes.\nThese are again truisms. I shall again repeat that they are not\ninteresting in themselves but in the consequences that can be\ndeduced from them. I know another truism: it tells me that man is\nmortal. One can nevertheless count the minds that have deduced the\nextreme conclusions from it. It is essential to consider as a constant\npoint of reference in this essay the regular hiatus between what we\nfancy we know and what we really know, practical assent and\nsimulated ignorance which allows us to live with ideas which, if we\n\f\ntruly put them to the test, ought to upset our whole life. Faced with\nthis inextricable contradiction of the mind, we shall fully grasp the\ndivorce separating us from our own creations. So long as the mind\nkeeps silent in the motionless world of its hopes, everything is\nre\u0000ected and arranged in the unity of its nostalgia. But with its \u0000rst\nmove this world cracks and tumbles: an in\u0000nite number of\nshimmering fragments is o\u0000ered to the understanding. We must\ndespair of ever reconstructing the familiar, calm surface which\nwould give us peace of heart. After so many centuries of inquiries,\nso many abdications among thinkers, we are well aware that this is\ntrue for all our knowledge. With the exception of professional\nrationalists, today people despair of true knowledge. If the only\nsigni\u0000cant history of human thought were to be written, it would\nhave to be the history of its successive regrets and its impotences.\nOf whom and of what indeed can I say: “I know that!” This heart\nwithin me I can feel, and I judge that it exists. This world I can\ntouch, and I likewise judge that it exists. There ends all my\nknowledge, and the rest is construction. For if I try to seize this self\nof which I feel sure, if I try to de\u0000ne and to summarize it, it is\nnothing but water slipping through my \u0000ngers. I can sketch one by\none all the aspects it is able to assume, all those likewise that have\nbeen attributed to it, this upbringing, this origin, this ardor or these\nsilences, this nobility or this vileness. But aspects cannot be added\nup. This very heart which is mine will forever remain inde\u0000nable to\nme. Between the certainty I have of my existence and the content I\ntry to give to that assurance, the gap will never be \u0000lled. Forever I\nshall be a stranger to myself. In psychology as in logic, there are\ntruths but no truth. Socrates’ “Know thyself” has as much value as\nthe “Be virtuous” of our confessionals. They reveal a nostalgia at\nthe same time as an ignorance. They are sterile exercises on great\nsubjects. They are legitimate only in precisely so far as they are\napproximate.\nAnd here are trees and I know their gnarled surface, water and I\nfeel its taste. These scents of grass and stars at night, certain\nevenings when the heart relaxes—how shall I negate this world\nwhose power and strength I feel? Yet all the knowledge on earth\n\f\nwill give me nothing to assure me that this world is mine. You\ndescribe it to me and you teach me to classify it. You enumerate its\nlaws and in my thirst for knowledge I admit that they are true. You\ntake apart its mechanism and my hope increases. At the \u0000nal stage\nyou teach me that this wondrous and multicolored universe can be\nreduced to the atom and that the atom itself can be reduced to the\nelectron. All this is good and I wait for you to continue. But you tell\nme of an invisible planetary system in which electrons gravitate\naround a nucleus. You explain this world to me with an image. I\nrealize then that you have been reduced to poetry: I shall never\nknow. Have I the time to become indignant? You have already\nchanged theories. So that science that was to teach me everything\nends up in a hypothesis, that lucidity founders in metaphor, that\nuncertainty is resolved in a work of art. What need had I of so many\ne\u0000orts? The soft lines of these hills and the hand of evening on this\ntroubled heart teach me much more. I have returned to my\nbeginning. I realize that if through science I can seize phenomena\nand enumerate them, I cannot, for all that, apprehend the world.\nWere I to trace its entire relief with my \u0000nger, I should not know\nany more. And you give me the choice between a description that is\nsure but that teaches me nothing and hypotheses that claim to teach\nme but that are not sure. A stranger to myself and to the world,\narmed solely with a thought that negates itself as soon as it asserts,\nwhat is this condition in which I can have peace only by refusing to\nknow and to live, in which the appetite for conquest bumps into\nwalls that defy its assaults? To will is to stir up paradoxes.\nEverything is ordered in such a way as to bring into being that\npoisoned peace produced by thoughtlessness, lack of heart, or fatal\nrenunciations.\nHence the intelligence, too, tells me in its way that this world is\nabsurd. Its contrary, blind reason, may well claim that all is clear; I\nwas waiting for proof and longing for it to be right. But despite so\nmany pretentious centuries and over the heads of so many eloquent\nand persuasive men, I know that is false. On this plane, at least,\nthere is no happiness if I cannot know. That universal reason,\npractical or ethical, that determinism, those categories that explain\n\f\neverything are enough to make a decent man laugh. They have\nnothing to do with the mind. They negate its profound truth, which\nis to be enchained. In this unintelligible and limited universe, man’s\nfate henceforth assumes its meaning. A horde of irrationals has\nsprung up and surrounds him until his ultimate end. In his recovered\nand now studied lucidity, the feeling of the absurd becomes clear\nand de\u0000nite. I said that the world is absurd, but I was too hasty.\nThis world in itself is not reasonable, that is all that can be said. But\nwhat is absurd is the confrontation of this irrational and the wild\nlonging for clarity whose call echoes in the human heart. The\nabsurd depends as much on man as on the world. For the moment it\nis all that links them together. It binds them one to the other as\nonly hatred can weld two creatures together. This is all I can discern\nclearly in this measureless universe where my adventure takes\nplace. Let us pause here. If I hold to be true that absurdity that\ndetermines my relationship with life, if I become thoroughly\nimbued with that sentiment that seizes me in face of the world’s\nscenes, with that lucidity imposed on me by the pursuit of a science,\nI must sacri\u0000ce everything to these certainties and I must see them\nsquarely to be able to maintain them. Above all, I must adapt my\nbehavior to them and pursue them in all their consequences. I am\nspeaking here of decency. But I want to know beforehand if thought\ncan live in those deserts.\n* * *\nI already know that thought has at least entered those deserts.\nThere it found its bread. There it realized that it had previously\nbeen feeding on phantoms. It justi\u0000ed some of the most urgent\nthemes of human re\u0000ection.\nFrom the moment absurdity is recognized, it becomes a passion,\nthe most harrowing of all. But whether or not one can live with\none’s passions, whether or not one can accept their law, which is to\nburn the heart they simultaneously exalt—that is the whole\nquestion. It is not, however, the one we shall ask just yet. It stands\nat the center of this experience. There will be time to come back to\n\f\nit. Let us recognize rather those themes and those impulses born of\nthe desert. It will su\u0000ce to enumerate them. They, too, are known\nto all today. There have always been men to defend the rights of\nthe irrational. The tradition of what may be called humiliated\nthought has never ceased to exist. The criticism of rationalism has\nbeen made so often that it seems unnecessary to begin again. Yet\nour epoch is marked by the rebirth of those paradoxical systems\nthat strive to trip up the reason as if truly it had always forged\nahead. But that is not so much a proof of the e\u0000cacy of the reason\nas of the intensity of its hopes. On the plane of history, such a\nconstancy of two attitudes illustrates the essential passion of man\ntorn between his urge toward unity and the clear vision he may\nhave of the walls enclosing him.\nBut never perhaps at any time has the attack on reason been more\nviolent than in ours. Since Zarathustra’s great outburst: “By chance\nit is the oldest nobility in the world. I conferred it upon all things\nwhen I proclaimed that above them no eternal will was exercised,”\nsince Kierkegaard’s fatal illness, “that malady that leads to death\nwith nothing else following it,” the signi\u0000cant and tormenting\nthemes of absurd thought have followed one another. Or at least,\nand this proviso is of capital importance, the themes of irrational\nand religious thought. From Jaspers to Heidegger, from\nKierkegaard to Chestov, from the phenomenologists to Scheler, on\nthe logical plane and on the moral plane, a whole family of minds\nrelated by their nostalgia but opposed by their methods or their\naims, have persisted in blocking the royal road of reason and in\nrecovering the direct paths of truth. Here I assume these thoughts to\nbe known and lived. Whatever may be or have been their\nambitions, all started out from that indescribable universe where\ncontradiction, antinomy, anguish, or impotence reigns. And what\nthey have in common is precisely the themes so far disclosed. For\nthem, too, it must be said that what matters above all is the\nconclusions they have managed to draw from those discoveries.\nThat matters so much that they must be examined separately. But\nfor the moment we are concerned solely with their discoveries and\ntheir initial experiments. We are concerned solely with noting their"

    "raw_text": "agreement. If it would be presumptuous to try to deal with their\nphilosophies, it is possible and su\u0000cient in any case to bring out the\nclimate that is common to them.\nHeidegger considers the human condition coldly and announces\nthat that existence is humiliated. The only reality is “anxiety” in the\nwhole chain of beings. To the man lost in the world and its\ndiversions this anxiety is a brief, \u0000eeting fear. But if that fear\nbecomes conscious of itself, it becomes anguish, the perpetual\nclimate of the lucid man “in whom existence is concentrated.” This\nprofessor of philosophy writes without trembling and in the most\nabstract language in the world that “the \u0000nite and limited character\nof human existence is more primordial than man himself.” His\ninterest in Kant extends only to recognizing the restricted character\nof his “pure Reason.” This is to conclude at the end of his analyses\nthat “the world can no longer o\u0000er anything to the man \u0000lled with\nanguish.” This anxiety seems to him so much more important than\nall the categories in the world that he thinks and talks only of it. He\nenumerates its aspects: boredom when the ordinary man strives to\nquash it in him and benumb it; terror when the mind contemplates\ndeath. He too does not separate consciousness from the absurd. The\nconsciousness of death is the call of anxiety and “existence then\ndelivers itself its own summons through the intermediary of\nconsciousness.” It is the very voice of anguish and it adjures\nexistence “to return from its loss in the anonymous They.” For him,\ntoo, one must not sleep, but must keep alert until the\nconsummation. He stands in this absurd world and points out its\nephemeral character. He seeks his way amid these ruins.\nJaspers despairs of any ontology because he claims that we have\nlost “naiveté.” He knows that we can achieve nothing that will\ntranscend the fatal game of appearances. He knows that the end of\nthe mind is failure. He tarries over the spiritual adventures revealed\nby history and pitilessly discloses the \u0000aw in each system, the\nillusion that saved everything, the preaching that hid nothing. In\nthis ravaged world in which the impossibility of knowledge is\nestablished, in which everlasting nothingness seems the only reality\n\f\nand irremediable despair seems the only attitude, he tries to recover\nthe Ariadne’s thread that leads to divine secrets.\nChestov, for his part, throughout a wonderfully monotonous\nwork, constantly straining toward the same truths, tirelessly\ndemonstrates that the tightest system, the most universal\nrationalism always stumbles eventually on the irrational of human\nthought. None of the ironic facts or ridiculous contradictions that\ndepreciate the reason escapes him. One thing only interests him,\nand that is the exception, whether in the domain of the heart or of\nthe mind. Through the Dostoevskian experiences of the condemned\nman, the exacerbated adventures of the Nietzschean mind, Hamlet’s\nimprecations, or the bitter aristocracy of an Ibsen, he tracks down,\nilluminates, and magni\u0000es the human revolt against the\nirremediable. He refuses the reason its reasons and begins to\nadvance with some decision only in the middle of that colorless\ndesert where all certainties have become stones.\nOf all perhaps the most engaging, Kierkegaard, for a part of his\nexistence at least, does more than discover the absurd, he lives it.\nThe man who writes: “The surest of stubborn silences is not to hold\none’s tongue but to talk” makes sure in the beginning that no truth\nis absolute or can render satisfactory an existence that is impossible\nin itself. Don Juan of the understanding, he multiplies pseudonyms\nand contradictions, writes his Discourses of Edi\u0000cation at the same\ntime as that manual of cynical spiritualism, The Diary of the Seducer.\nHe refuses consolations, ethics, reliable principles. As for that thorn\nhe feels in his heart, he is careful not to quiet its pain. On the\ncontrary, he awakens it and, in the desperate joy of a man cruci\u0000ed\nand happy to be so, he builds up piece by piece—lucidity, refusal,\nmake-believe—a category of the man possessed. That face both\ntender and sneering, those pirouettes followed by a cry from the\nheart are the absurd spirit itself grappling with a reality beyond its\ncomprehension. And the spiritual adventure that leads Kierkegaard\nto his beloved scandals begins likewise in the chaos of an experience\ndivested of its setting and relegated to its original incoherence.\nOn quite a di\u0000erent plane, that of method, Husserl and the\nphenomenologists, by their very extravagances, reinstate the world\n\f\nin its diversity and deny the transcendent power of the reason. The\nspiritual universe becomes incalculably enriched through them. The\nrose petal, the milestone, or the human hand are as important as\nlove, desire, or the laws of gravity. Thinking ceases to be unifying\nor making a semblance familiar in the guise of a major principle.\nThinking is learning all over again to see, to be attentive, to focus\nconsciousness; it is turning every idea and every image, in the\nmanner of Proust, into a privileged moment. What justi\u0000es thought\nis its extreme consciousness. Though more positive than\nKierkegaard’s or Chestov’s, Husserl’s manner of proceeding, in the\nbeginning, nevertheless negates the classic method of the reason,\ndisappoints hope, opens to intuition and to the heart a whole\nproliferation of phenomena, the wealth of which has about it\nsomething inhuman. These paths lead to all sciences or to none. This\namounts to saying that in this case the means are more important\nthan the end. All that is involved is “an attitude for understanding”\nand not a consolation. Let me repeat: in the beginning, at very least.\nHow can one fail to feel the basic relationship of these minds!\nHow can one fail to see that they take their stand around a\nprivileged and bitter moment in which hope has no further place? I\nwant everything to be explained to me or nothing. And the reason is\nimpotent when it hears this cry from the heart. The mind aroused\nby this insistence seeks and \u0000nds nothing but contradictions and\nnonsense. What I fail to understand is nonsense. The world is\npeopled with such irrationals. The world itself, whose single\nmeaning I do not understand, is but a vast irrational. If one could\nonly say just once: “This is clear,” all would be saved. But these\nmen vie with one another in proclaiming that nothing is clear, all is\nchaos, that all man has is his lucidity and his de\u0000nite knowledge of\nthe walls surrounding him.\nAll these experiences agree and con\u0000rm one another. The mind,\nwhen it reaches its limits, must make a judgment and choose its\nconclusions. This is where suicide and the reply stand. But I wish to\nreverse the order of the inquiry and start out from the intelligent\nadventure and come back to daily acts. The experiences called to\nmind here were born in the desert that we must not leave behind.\n\f\nAt least it is essential to know how far they went. At this point of\nhis e\u0000ort man stands face to face with the irrational. He feels within\nhim his longing for happiness and for reason. The absurd is born of\nthis confrontation between the human need and the unreasonable\nsilence of the world. This must not be forgotten. This must be clung\nto because the whole consequence of a life can depend on it. The\nirrational, the human nostalgia, and the absurd that is born of their\nencounter—these are the three characters in the drama that must\nnecessarily end with all the logic of which an existence is capable.\nPhilosophical Suicide\nThe feeling of the absurd is not, for all that, the notion of the\nabsurd. It lays the foundations for it, and that is all. It is not limited\nto that notion, except in the brief moment when it passes judgment\non the universe. Subsequently it has a chance of going further. It is\nalive; in other words, it must die or else reverberate. So it is with\nthe themes we have gathered together. But there again what\ninterests me is not works or minds, criticism of which would call for\nanother form and another place, but the discovery of what their\nconclusions have in common. Never, perhaps, have minds been so\ndi\u0000erent. And yet we recognize as identical the spiritual landscapes\nin which they get under way. Likewise, despite such dissimilar\nzones of knowledge, the cry that terminates their itinerary rings out\nin the same way. It is evident that the thinkers we have just recalled\nhave a common climate. To say that that climate is deadly scarcely\namounts to playing on words. Living under that sti\u0000ing sky forces\none to get away or to stay. The important thing is to \u0000nd out how\npeople get away in the \u0000rst case and why people stay in the second\ncase. This is how I de\u0000ne the problem of suicide and the possible\ninterest in the conclusions of existential philosophy.\nBut \u0000rst I want to detour from the direct path. Up to now we\nhave managed to circumscribe the absurd from the outside. One\ncan, however, wonder how much is clear in that notion and by\n\f\ndirect analysis try to discover its meaning on the one hand and, on\nthe other, the consequences it involves.\nIf I accuse an innocent man of a monstrous crime, if I tell a\nvirtuous man that he has coveted his own sister, he will reply that\nthis is absurd. His indignation has its comical aspect. But it also has\nits fundamental reason. The virtuous man illustrates by that reply\nthe de\u0000nitive antinomy existing between the deed I am attributing\nto him and his lifelong principles. “It’s absurd” means “It’s\nimpossible” but also “It’s contradictory.” If I see a man armed only\nwith a sword attack a group of machine guns, I shall consider his act\nto be absurd. But it is so solely by virtue of the disproportion\nbetween his intention and the reality he will encounter, of the\ncontradiction I notice between his true strength and the aim he has\nin view. Likewise we shall deem a verdict absurd when we contrast\nit with the verdict the facts apparently dictated. And, similarly, a\ndemonstration by the absurd is achieved by comparing the\nconsequences of such a reasoning with the logical reality one wants\nto set up. In all these cases, from the simplest to the most complex,\nthe magnitude of the absurdity will be in direct ratio to the distance\nbetween the two terms of my comparison. There are absurd\nmarriages, challenges, rancors, silences, wars, and even peace\ntreaties. For each of them the absurdity springs from a comparison.\nI am thus justi\u0000ed in saying that the feeling of absurdity does not\nspring from the mere scrutiny of a fact or an impression, but that it\nbursts from the comparison between a bare fact and a certain\nreality, between an action and the world that transcends it. The\nabsurd is essentially a divorce. It lies in neither of the elements\ncompared; it is born of their confrontation.\nIn this particular case and on the plane of intelligence, I can\ntherefore say that the Absurd is not in man (if such a metaphor\ncould have a meaning) nor in the world, but in their presence\ntogether. For the moment it is the only bond uniting them. If I wish\nto limit myself to facts, I know what man wants, I know what the\nworld o\u0000ers him, and now I can say that I also know what links\nthem. I have no need to dig deeper. A single certainty is enough for\nthe seeker. He simply has to derive all the consequences from it.\n\f\nThe immediate consequence is also a rule of method. The odd\ntrinity brought to light in this way is certainly not a startling\ndiscovery. But it resembles the data of experience in that it is both\nin\u0000nitely simple and in\u0000nitely complicated. Its \u0000rst distinguishing\nfeature in this regard is that it cannot be divided. To destroy one of\nits terms is to destroy the whole. There can be no absurd outside the\nhuman mind. Thus, like everything else, the absurd ends with death.\nBut there can be no absurd outside this world either. And it is by\nthis elementary criterion that I judge the notion of the absurd to be\nessential and consider that it can stand as the \u0000rst of my truths. The\nrule of method alluded to above appears here. If I judge that a thing\nis true, I must preserve it. If I attempt to solve a problem, at least I\nmust not by that very solution conjure away one of the terms of the\nproblem. For me the sole datum is the absurd. The \u0000rst and, after\nall, the only condition of my inquiry is to preserve the very thing\nthat crushes me, consequently to respect what I consider essential in\nit. I have just de\u0000ned it as a confrontation and an unceasing\nstruggle.\nAnd carrying this absurd logic to its conclusion, I must admit that\nthat struggle implies a total absence of hope (which has nothing to\ndo with despair), a continual rejection (which must not be confused\nwith renunciation), and a conscious dissatisfaction (which must not\nbe compared to immature unrest). Everything that destroys,\nconjures away, or exorcises these requirements (and, to begin with,\nconsent which overthrows divorce) ruins the absurd and devaluates\nthe attitude that may then be proposed. The absurd has meaning\nonly in so far as it is not agreed to.\n* * *\nThere exists an obvious fact that seems utterly moral: namely,\nthat a man is always a prey to his truths. Once he has admitted\nthem, he cannot free himself from them. One has to pay something.\nA man who has become conscious of the absurd is forever bound to\nit. A man devoid of hope and conscious of being so has ceased to\nbelong to the future. That is natural. But it is just as natural that he\n\f\nshould strive to escape the universe of which he is the creator. All\nthe foregoing has signi\u0000cance only on account of this paradox.\nCertain men, starting from a critique of rationalism, have admitted\nthe absurd climate. Nothing is more instructive in this regard than\nto scrutinize the way in which they have elaborated their\nconsequences.\nNow, to limit myself to existential philosophies, I see that all of\nthem without exception suggest escape. Through an odd reasoning,\nstarting out from the absurd over the ruins of reason, in a closed\nuniverse limited to the human, they deify what crushes them and\n\u0000nd reason to hope in what impoverishes them. That forced hope is\nreligious in all of them. It deserves attention.\nI shall merely analyze here as examples a few themes dear to\nChestov and Kierkegaard. But Jaspers will provide us, in caricatural\nform, a typical example of this attitude. As a result the rest will be\nclearer. He is left powerless to realize the transcendent, incapable of\nplumbing the depth of experience, and conscious of that universe\nupset by failure. Will he advance or at least draw the conclusions\nfrom that failure? He contributes nothing new. He has found\nnothing in experience but the confession of his own impotence and\nno occasion to infer any satisfactory principle. Yet without\njusti\u0000cation, as he says to himself, he suddenly asserts all at once\nthe transcendent, the essence of experience, and the superhuman\nsigni\u0000cance of life when he writes: “Does not the failure reveal,\nbeyond any possible explanation and interpretation, not the absence\nbut the existence of transcendence?” That existence which, suddenly\nand through a blind act of human con\u0000dence, explains everything,\nhe de\u0000nes as “the unthinkable unity of the general and the\nparticular.” Thus the absurd becomes god (in the broadest meaning\nof this word) and that inability to understand becomes the existence\nthat illuminates everything. Nothing logically prepares this\nreasoning. I can call it a leap. And paradoxically can be understood\nJaspers’s insistence, his in\u0000nite patience devoted to making the\nexperience of the transcendent impossible to realize. For the more\n\u0000eeting that approximation is, the more empty that de\u0000nition\nproves to be, and the more real that transcendent is to him; for the\n\f\npassion he devotes to asserting it is in direct proportion to the gap\nbetween his powers of explanation and the irrationality of the world\nand of experience. It thus appears that the more bitterly Jaspers\ndestroys the reason’s preconceptions, the more radically he will\nexplain the world. That apostle of humiliated thought will \u0000nd at\nthe very end of humiliation the means of regenerating being to its\nvery depth.\nMystical thought has familiarized us with such devices. They are\njust as legitimate as any attitude of mind. But for the moment I am\nacting as if I took a certain problem seriously. Without judging\nbeforehand the general value of this attitude or its educative power,\nI mean simply to consider whether it answers the conditions I set\nmyself, whether it is worthy of the con\u0000ict that concerns me. Thus I\nreturn to Chestov. A commentator relates a remark of his that\ndeserves interest: “The only true solution,” he said, “is precisely\nwhere human judgment sees no solution. Otherwise, what need\nwould we have of God? We turn toward God only to obtain the\nimpossible. As for the possible, men su\u0000ce.” If there is a Chestovian\nphilosophy, I can say that it is altogether summed up in this way.\nFor when, at the conclusion of his passionate analyses, Chestov\ndiscovers the fundamental absurdity of all existence, he does not\nsay: “This is the absurd,” but rather: “This is God: we must rely on\nhim even if he does not correspond to any of our rational\ncategories.” So that confusion may not be possible, the Russian\nphilosopher even hints that this God is perhaps full of hatred and\nhateful, incomprehensible and contradictory; but the more hideous\nis his face, the more he asserts his power. His greatness is his\nincoherence. His proof is his inhumanity. One must spring into him\nand by this leap free oneself from rational illusions. Thus, for\nChestov acceptance of the absurd is contemporaneous with the\nabsurd itself. Being aware of it amounts to accepting it, and the\nwhole logical e\u0000ort of his thought is to bring it out so that at the\nsame time the tremendous hope it involves may burst forth. Let me\nrepeat that this attitude is legitimate. But I am persisting here in\nconsidering a single problem and all its consequences. I do not have\nto examine the emotion of a thought or of an act of faith. I have a\n\f\nwhole lifetime to do that. I know that the rationalist \u0000nds Chestov’s\nattitude annoying. But I also feel that Chestov is right rather than\nthe rationalist, and I merely want to know if he remains faithful to\nthe commandments of the absurd.\nNow, if it is admitted that the absurd is the contrary of hope, it is\nseen that existential thought for Chestov presupposes the absurd but\nproves it only to dispel it. Such subtlety of thought is a conjuror’s\nemotional trick. When Chestov elsewhere sets his absurd in\nopposition to current morality and reason, he calls it truth and\nredemption. Hence, there is basically in that de\u0000nition of the absurd\nan approbation that Chestov grants it. If it is admitted that all the\npower of that notion lies in the way it runs counter to our\nelementary hopes, if it is felt that to remain, the absurd requires not\nto be consented to, then it can be clearly seen that it has lost its true\naspect, its human and relative character in order to enter an eternity\nthat is both incomprehensible and satisfying. If there is an absurd, it\nis in man’s universe. The moment the notion transforms itself into\neternity’s springboard, it ceases to be linked to human lucidity. The\nabsurd is no longer that evidence that man ascertains without\nconsenting to it. The struggle is eluded. Man integrates the absurd\nand in that communion causes to disappear its essential character,\nwhich is opposition, laceration, and divorce. This leap is an escape.\nChestov, who is so fond of quoting Hamlet’s remark: “The time is\nout of joint,” writes it down with a sort of savage hope that seems\nto belong to him in particular. For it is not in this sense that Hamlet\nsays it or Shakespeare writes it. The intoxication of the irrational\nand the vocation of rapture turn a lucid mind away from the absurd.\nTo Chestov reason is useless but there is something beyond reason.\nTo an absurd mind reason is useless and there is nothing beyond\nreason.\nThis leap can at least enlighten us a little more as to the true\nnature of the absurd. We know that it is worthless except in an\nequilibrium, that it is, above all, in the comparison and not in the\nterms of that comparison. But it so happens that Chestov puts all the\nemphasis on one of the terms and destroys the equilibrium. Our\nappetite for understanding, our nostalgia for the absolute are\n\f\nexplicable only in so far, precisely, as we can understand and\nexplain many things. It is useless to negate the reason absolutely. It\nhas its order in which it is e\u0000cacious. It is properly that of human\nexperience. Whence we wanted to make everything clear. If we\ncannot do so, if the absurd is born on that occasion, it is born\nprecisely at the very meeting-point of that e\u0000cacious but limited\nreason with the ever resurgent irrational. Now, when Chestov rises\nup against a Hegelian proposition such as “the motion of the solar\nsystem takes place in conformity with immutable laws and those\nlaws are its reason,” when he devotes all his passion to upsetting\nSpinoza’s rationalism, he concludes, in e\u0000ect, in favor of the vanity\nof all reason. Whence, by a natural and illegitimate reversal, to the\npre-eminence of the irrational.5 But the transition is not evident. For\nhere may intervene the notion of limit and the notion of level. The\nlaws of nature may be operative up to a certain limit, beyond which\nthey turn against themselves to give birth to the absurd. Or else,\nthey may justify themselves on the level of description without for\nthat reason being true on the level of explanation. Everything is\nsacri\u0000ced here to the irrational, and, the demand for clarity being\nconjured away, the absurd disappears with one of the terms of its\ncomparison. The absurd man, on the other hand, does not undertake\nsuch a leveling process. He recognizes the struggle, does not\nabsolutely scorn reason, and admits the irrational. Thus he again\nembraces in a single glance all the data of experience and he is little\ninclined to leap before knowing. He knows simply that in that alert\nawareness there is no further place for hope.\nWhat is perceptible in Leo Chestov will be perhaps even more so\nin Kierkegaard. To be sure, it is hard to outline clear propositions in\nso elusive a writer. But, despite apparently opposed writings,\nbeyond the pseudonyms, the tricks, and the smiles, can be felt\nthroughout that work, as it were, the presentiment (at the same\ntime as the apprehension) of a truth which eventually bursts forth in\nthe last works: Kierkegaard likewise takes the leap. His childhood\nhaving been so frightened by Christianity, he ultimately returns to\nits harshest aspect. For him, too, antinomy and paradox become\ncriteria of the religious. Thus, the very thing that led to despair of\n\f\nthe meaning and depth of this life now gives it its truth and its\nclarity. Christianity is the scandal, and what Kierkegaard calls for\nquite plainly is the third sacri\u0000ce required by Ignatius Loyola, the\none in which God most rejoices: “The sacri\u0000ce of the intellect.”6\nThis e\u0000ect of the “leap” is odd, but must not surprise us any longer.\nHe makes of the absurd the criterion of the other world, whereas it\nis simply a residue of the experience of this world. “In his failure,”\nsays Kierkegaard, “the believer \u0000nds his triumph.”\nIt is not for me to wonder to what stirring preaching this attitude\nis linked. I merely have to wonder if the spectacle of the absurd and\nits own character justi\u0000es it. On this point, I know that it is not so.\nUpon considering again the content of the absurd, one understands\nbetter the method that inspired Kierkegaard. Between the irrational\nof the world and the insurgent nostalgia of the absurd, he does not\nmaintain the equilibrium. He does not respect the relationship that\nconstitutes, properly speaking, the feeling of absurdity. Sure of\nbeing unable to escape the irrational, he wants at least to save\nhimself from that desperate nostalgia that seems to him sterile and\ndevoid of implication. But if he may be right on this point in his\njudgment, he could not be in his negation. If he substitutes for his\ncry of revolt a frantic adherence, at once he is led to blind himself\nto the absurd which hitherto enlightened him and to deify the only\ncertainty he henceforth possesses, the irrational. The important\nthing, as Abbé Galiani said to Mme d’Epinay, is not to be cured, but\nto live with one’s ailments. Kierkegaard wants to be cured. To be\ncured is his frenzied wish, and it runs throughout his whole journal.\nThe entire e\u0000ort of his intelligence is to escape the antinomy of the\nhuman condition. An all the more desperate e\u0000ort since he\nintermittently perceives its vanity when he speaks of himself, as if\nneither fear of God nor piety were capable of bringing him to\npeace. Thus it is that, through a strained subterfuge, he gives the\nirrational the appearance and God the attributes of the absurd:\nunjust, incoherent, and incomprehensible. Intelligence alone in him\nstrives to sti\u0000e the underlying demands of the human heart. Since\nnothing is proved, everything can be proved.\n\f\nIndeed, Kierkegaard himself shows us the path taken. I do not\nwant to suggest anything here, but how can one fail to read in his\nworks the signs of an almost intentional mutilation of the soul to\nbalance the mutilation accepted in regard to the absurd? It is the\nleitmotiv of the Journal. “What I lacked was the animal which also\nbelongs to human destiny.… But give me a body then.” And further\non: “Oh! especially in my early youth what should I not have given\nto be a man, even for six months … what I lack, basically, is a body\nand the physical conditions of existence.” Elsewhere, the same man\nnevertheless adopts the great cry of hope that has come down\nthrough so many centuries and quickened so many hearts, except\nthat of the absurd man. “But for the Christian death is certainly not\nthe end of everything and it implies in\u0000nitely more hope than life\nimplies for us, even when that life is over\u0000owing with health and\nvigor.” Reconciliation through scandal is still reconciliation. It\nallows one perhaps, as can be seen, to derive hope of its contrary,\nwhich is death. But even if fellow-feeling inclines one toward that\nattitude, still it must be said that excess justi\u0000es nothing. That\ntranscends, as the saying goes, the human scale; therefore it must be\nsuperhuman. But this “therefore” is super\u0000uous. There is no logical\ncertainty here. There is no experimental probability either. All I can\nsay is that, in fact, that transcends my scale. If I do not draw a\nnegation from it, at least I do not want to found anything on the\nincomprehensible. I want to know whether I can live with what I\nknow and with that alone. I am told again that here the intelligence\nmust sacri\u0000ce its pride and the reason bow down. But if I recognize\nthe limits of the reason, I do not therefore negate it, recognizing its\nrelative powers. I merely want to remain in this middle path where\nthe intelligence can remain clear. If that is its pride, I see no\nsu\u0000cient reason for giving it up. Nothing more profound, for\nexample, than Kierkegaard’s view according to which despair is not\na fact but a state: the very state of sin. For sin is what alienates\nfrom God. The absurd, which is the metaphysical state of the\nconscious man, does not lead to God.7 Perhaps this notion will\nbecome clearer if I risk this shocking statement: the absurd is sin\nwithout God.\n\f\nIt is a matter of living in that state of the absurd. I know on what\nit is founded, this mind and this world straining against each other\nwithout being able to embrace each other. I ask for the rule of life\nof that state, and what I am o\u0000ered neglects its basis, negates one\nof the terms of the painful opposition, demands of me a resignation.\nI ask what is involved in the condition I recognize as mine; I know\nit implies obscurity and ignorance; and I am assured that this\nignorance explains everything and that this darkness is my light. But\nthere is no reply here to my intent, and this stirring lyricism cannot\nhide the paradox from me. One must therefore turn away.\nKierkegaard may shout in warning: “If man had no eternal\nconsciousness, if, at the bottom of everything, there were merely a\nwild, seething force producing everything, both large and tri\u0000ing, in\nthe storm of dark passions, if the bottomless void that nothing can\n\u0000ll underlay all things, what would life be but despair?” This cry is\nnot likely to stop the absurd man. Seeking what is true is not\nseeking what is desirable. If in order to elude the anxious question:\n“What would life be?” one must, like the donkey, feed on the roses\nof illusion, then the absurd mind, rather than resigning itself to\nfalsehood, prefers to adopt fearlessly Kierkegaard’s reply: “despair.”\nEverything considered, a determined soul will always manage.\n* * *\nI am taking the liberty at this point of calling the existential\nattitude philosophical suicide. But this does not imply a judgment. It\nis a convenient way of indicating the movement by which a thought\nnegates itself and tends to transcend itself in its very negation. For\nthe existentials negation is their God. To be precise, that god is\nmaintained only through the negation of human reason.8 But, like\nsuicides, gods change with men. There are many ways of leaping,\nthe essential being to leap. Those redeeming negations, those\nultimate contradictions which negate the obstacle that has not yet\nbeen leaped over, may spring just as well (this is the paradox at\nwhich this reasoning aims) from a certain religious inspiration as"

    "raw_text": "from the rational order. They always lay claim to the eternal, and it\nis solely in this that they take the leap.\nIt must be repeated that the reasoning developed in this essay\nleaves out altogether the most widespread spiritual attitude of our\nenlightened age: the one, based on the principle that all is reason,\nwhich aims to explain the world. It is natural to give a clear view of\nthe world after accepting the idea that it must be clear. That is even\nlegitimate, but does not concern the reasoning we are following out\nhere. In fact, our aim is to shed light upon the step taken by the\nmind when, starting from a philosophy of the world’s lack of\nmeaning, it ends up by \u0000nding a meaning and depth in it. The most\ntouching of those steps is religious in essence; it becomes obvious in\nthe theme of the irrational. But the most paradoxical and most\nsigni\u0000cant is certainly the one that attributes rational reasons to a\nworld it originally imagined as devoid of any guiding principle. It is\nimpossible in any case to reach the consequences that concern us\nwithout having given an idea of this new attainment of the spirit of\nnostalgia.\nI shall examine merely the theme of “the Intention” made\nfashionable by Husserl and the phenomenologists. I have already\nalluded to it. Originally Husserl’s method negates the classic\nprocedure of the reason. Let me repeat. Thinking is not unifying or\nmaking the appearance familiar under the guise of a great principle.\nThinking is learning all over again how to see, directing one’s\nconsciousness, making of every image a privileged place. In other\nwords, phenomenology declines to explain the world, it wants to be\nmerely a description of actual experience. It con\u0000rms absurd\nthought in its initial assertion that there is no truth, but merely\ntruths. From the evening breeze to this hand on my shoulder,\neverything has its truth. Consciousness illuminates it by paying\nattention to it. Consciousness does not form the object of its\nunderstanding, it merely focuses, it is the act of attention, and, to\nborrow a Bergsonian image, it resembles the projector that\nsuddenly focuses on an image. The di\u0000erence is that there is no\nscenario, but a successive and incoherent illustration. In that magic\nlantern all the pictures are privileged. Consciousness suspends in\n\f\nexperience the objects of its attention. Through its miracle it\nisolates them. Henceforth they are beyond all judgments. This is the\n“intention” that characterizes consciousness. But the word does not\nimply any idea of \u0000nality; it is taken in its sense of “direction”: its\nonly value is topographical.\nAt \u0000rst sight, it certainly seems that in this way nothing\ncontradicts the absurd spirit. That apparent modesty of thought that\nlimits itself to describing what it declines to explain, that intentional\ndiscipline whence result paradoxically a profound enrichment of\nexperience and the rebirth of the world in its prolixity are absurd\nprocedures. At least at \u0000rst sight. For methods of thought, in this\ncase as elsewhere, always assume two aspects, one psychological\nand the other metaphysical.9 Thereby they harbor two truths. If the\ntheme of the intentional claims to illustrate merely a psychological\nattitude, by which reality is drained instead of being explained,\nnothing in fact separates it from the absurd spirit. It aims to\nenumerate what it cannot transcend. It a\u0000rms solely that without\nany unifying principle thought can still take delight in describing\nand understanding every aspect of experience. The truth involved\nthen for each of those aspects is psychological in nature. It simply\ntesti\u0000es to the “interest” that reality can o\u0000er. It is a way of\nawaking a sleeping world and of making it vivid to the mind. But if\none attempts to extend and give a rational basis to that notion of\ntruth, if one claims to discover in this way the “essence” of each\nobject of knowledge, one restores its depth to experience. For an\nabsurd mind that is incomprehensible. Now, it is this wavering\nbetween modesty and assurance that is noticeable in the intentional\nattitude, and this shimmering of phenomenological thought will\nillustrate the absurd reasoning better than anything else.\nFor Husserl speaks likewise of “extra-temporal essences” brought\nto light by the intention, and he sounds like Plato. All things are not\nexplained by one thing but by all things. I see no di\u0000erence. To be\nsure, those ideas or those essences that consciousness “e\u0000ectuates”\nat the end of every description are not yet to be considered perfect\nmodels. But it is asserted that they are directly present in each\ndatum of perception. There is no longer a single idea explaining\n\f\neverything, but an in\u0000nite number of essences giving a meaning to\nan in\u0000nite number of objects. The world comes to a stop, but also\nlights up. Platonic realism becomes intuitive, but it is still realism.\nKierkegaard was swallowed up in his God; Parmenides plunged\nthought into the One. But here thought hurls itself into an abstract\npolytheism. But this is not all: hallucinations and \u0000ctions likewise\nbelong to “extra-temporal essences.” In the new world of ideas, the\nspecies of centaurs collaborates with the more modest species of\nmetropolitan man.\nFor the absurd man, there was a truth as well as a bitterness in\nthat purely psychological opinion that all aspects of the world are\nprivileged. To say that everything is privileged is tantamount to\nsaying that everything is equivalent. But the metaphysical aspect of\nthat truth is so far-reaching that through an elementary reaction he\nfeels closer perhaps to Plato. He is taught, in fact, that every image\npresupposes an equally privileged essence. In this ideal world\nwithout hierarchy, the formal army is composed solely of generals.\nTo be sure, transcendency had been eliminated. But a sudden shift\nin thought brings back into the world a sort of fragmentary\nimmanence which restores to the universe its depth.\nAm I to fear having carried too far a theme handled with greater\ncircumspection by its creators? I read merely these assertions of\nHusserl, apparently paradoxical yet rigorously logical if what\nprecedes is accepted: “That which is true is true absolutely, in itself;\ntruth is one, identical with itself, however di\u0000erent the creatures\nwho perceive it, men, monsters, angels or gods.” Reason triumphs\nand trumpets forth with that voice, I cannot deny. What can its\nassertions mean in the absurd world? The perception of an angel or\na god has no meaning for me. That geometrical spot where divine\nreason rati\u0000es mine will always be incomprehensible to me. There,\ntoo, I discern a leap, and though performed in the abstract, it\nnonetheless means for me forgetting just what I do not want to\nforget. When farther on Husserl exclaims: “If all masses subject to\nattraction were to disappear, the law of attraction would not be\ndestroyed but would simply remain without any possible\napplication,” I know that I am faced with a metaphysic of\n\f\nconsolation. And if I want to discover the point where thought\nleaves the path of evidence, I have only to reread the parallel\nreasoning that Husserl voices regarding the mind: “If we could\ncontemplate clearly the exact laws of psychic processes, they would\nbe seen to be likewise eternal and invariable, like the basic laws of\ntheoretical natural science. Hence they would be valid even if there\nwere no psychic process.” Even if the mind were not, its laws would\nbe! I see then that of a psychological truth Husserl aims to make a\nrational rule: after having denied the integrating power of human\nreason, he leaps by this expedient to eternal Reason.\nHusserl’s theme of the “concrete universe” cannot then surprise\nme. If I am told that all essences are not formal but that some are\nmaterial, that the \u0000rst are the object of logic and the second of\nscience, this is merely a question of de\u0000nition. The abstract, I am\ntold, indicates but a part, without consistency in itself, of a concrete\nuniversal. But the wavering already noted allows me to throw light\non the confusion of these terms. For that may mean that the\nconcrete object of my attention, this sky, the re\u0000ection of that\nwater on this coat, alone preserve the prestige of the real that my\ninterest isolates in the world. And I shall not deny it. But that may\nmean also that this coat itself is universal, has its particular and\nsu\u0000cient essence, belongs to the world of forms. I then realize that\nmerely the order of the procession has been changed. This world\nhas ceased to have its re\u0000ection in a higher universe, but the heaven\nof forms is \u0000gured in the host of images of this earth. This changes\nnothing for me. Rather than encountering here a taste for the\nconcrete, the meaning of the human condition, I \u0000nd an\nintellectualism su\u0000ciently unbridled to generalize the concrete\nitself.\n* * *\nIt is futile to be amazed by the apparent paradox that leads\nthought to its own negation by the opposite paths of humiliated\nreason and triumphal reason. From the abstract god of Husserl to\nthe dazzling god of Kierkegaard the distance is not so great. Reason\n\f\nand the irrational lead to the same preaching. In truth the way\nmatters but little; the will to arrive su\u0000ces. The abstract\nphilosopher and the religious philosopher start out from the same\ndisorder and support each other in the same anxiety. But the\nessential is to explain. Nostalgia is stronger here than knowledge. It\nis signi\u0000cant that the thought of the epoch is at once one of the\nmost deeply imbued with a philosophy of the non-signi\u0000cance of the\nworld and one of the most divided in its conclusions. It is constantly\noscillating between extreme rationalization of reality which tends to\nbreak up that thought into standard reasons and its extreme\nirrationalization which tends to deify it. But this divorce is only\napparent. It is a matter of reconciliation, and, in both cases, the leap\nsu\u0000ces. It is always wrongly thought that the notion of reason is a\none-way notion. To tell the truth, however rigorous it may be in its\nambition, this concept is nonetheless just as unstable as others.\nReason bears a quite human aspect, but it also is able to turn toward\nthe divine. Since Plotinus, who was the \u0000rst to reconcile it with the\neternal climate, it has learned to turn away from the most cherished\nof its principles, which is contradiction, in order to integrate into it\nthe strangest, the quite magic one of participation.1 It is an\ninstrument of thought and not thought itself. Above all, a man’s\nthought is his nostalgia.\nJust as reason was able to soothe the melancholy of Plotinus, it\nprovides modern anguish the means of calming itself in the familiar\nsetting of the eternal. The absurd mind has less luck. For it the\nworld is neither so rational nor so irrational. It is unreasonable and\nonly that. With Husserl the reason eventually has no limits at all.\nThe absurd, on the contrary, establishes its limits since it is\npowerless to calm its anguish. Kierkegaard independently asserts\nthat a single limit is enough to negate that anguish. But the absurd\ndoes not go so far. For it that limit is directed solely at the reason’s\nambitions. The theme of the irrational, as it is conceived by the\nexistentials, is reason becoming confused and escaping by negating\nitself. The absurd is lucid reason noting its limits.\nOnly at the end of this di\u0000cult path does the absurd man\nrecognize his true motives. Upon comparing his inner exigence and\n\f\nwhat is then o\u0000ered him, he suddenly feels he is going to turn\naway. In the universe of Husserl the world becomes clear and that\nlonging for familiarity that man’s heart harbors becomes useless. In\nKierkegaard’s apocalypse that desire for clarity must be given up if\nit wants to be satis\u0000ed. Sin is not so much knowing (if it were,\neverybody would be innocent) as wanting to know. Indeed, it is the\nonly sin of which the absurd man can feel that it constitutes both his\nguilt and his innocence. He is o\u0000ered a solution in which all the past\ncontradictions have become merely polemical games. But this is not\nthe way he experienced them. Their truth must be preserved, which\nconsists in not being satis\u0000ed. He does not want preaching.\nMy reasoning wants to be faithful to the evidence that aroused it.\nThat evidence is the absurd. It is that divorce between the mind that\ndesires and the world that disappoints, my nostalgia for unity, this\nfragmented universe and the contradiction that binds them together.\nKierkegaard suppresses my nostalgia and Husserl gathers together\nthat universe. That is not what I was expecting. It was a matter of\nliving and thinking with those dislocations, of knowing whether one\nhad to accept or refuse. There can be no question of masking the\nevidence, of suppressing the absurd by denying one of the terms of\nits equation. It is essential to know whether one can live with it or\nwhether, on the other hand, logic commands one to die of it. I am\nnot interested in philosophical suicide, but rather in plain suicide. I\nmerely wish to purge it of its emotional content and know its logic\nand its integrity. Any other position implies for the absurd mind\ndeceit and the mind’s retreat before what the mind itself has\nbrought to light. Husserl claims to obey the desire to escape “the\ninveterate habit of living and thinking in certain well-known and\nconvenient conditions of existence,” but the \u0000nal leap restores in\nhim the eternal and its comfort. The leap does not represent an\nextreme danger as Kierkegaard would like it to do. The danger, on\nthe contrary, lies in the subtle instant that precedes the leap. Being\nable to remain on that dizzying crest—that is integrity and the rest\nis subterfuge. I know also that never has helplessness inspired such\nstriking harmonies as those of Kierkegaard. But if helplessness has\n\f\nits place in the indi\u0000erent landscapes of history, it has none in a\nreasoning whose exigence is now known.\nAbsurd Freedom\nNow the main thing is done, I hold certain facts from which I\ncannot separate. What I know, what is certain, what I cannot deny,\nwhat I cannot reject—this is what counts. I can negate everything of\nthat part of me that lives on vague nostalgias, except this desire for\nunity, this longing to solve, this need for clarity and cohesion. I can\nrefute everything in this world surrounding me that o\u0000ends or\nenraptures me, except this chaos, this sovereign chance and this\ndivine equivalence which springs from anarchy. I don’t know\nwhether this world has a meaning that transcends it. But I know\nthat I do not know that meaning and that it is impossible for me just\nnow to know it. What can a meaning outside my condition mean to\nme? I can understand only in human terms. What I touch, what\nresists me—that is what I understand. And these two certainties—\nmy appetite for the absolute and for unity and the impossibility of\nreducing this world to a rational and reasonable principle—I also\nknow that I cannot reconcile them. What other truth can I admit\nwithout lying, without bringing in a hope I lack and which means\nnothing within the limits of my condition?\nIf I were a tree among trees, a cat among animals, this life would\nhave a meaning, or rather this problem would not arise, for I should\nbelong to this world. I should be this world to which I am now\nopposed by my whole consciousness and my whole insistence upon\nfamiliarity. This ridiculous reason is what sets me in opposition to\nall creation. I cannot cross it out with a stroke of the pen. What I\nbelieve to be true I must therefore preserve. What seems to me so\nobvious, even against me, I must support. And what constitutes the\nbasis of that con\u0000ict, of that break between the world and my mind,\nbut the awareness of it? If therefore I want to preserve it, I can\nthrough a constant awareness, ever revived, ever alert. This is what,\nfor the moment, I must remember. At this moment the absurd, so\n\f\nobvious and yet so hard to win, returns to a man’s life and \u0000nds its\nhome there. At this moment, too, the mind can leave the arid, dried-\nup path of lucid e\u0000ort. That path now emerges in daily life. It\nencounters the world of the anonymous impersonal pronoun “one,”\nbut henceforth man enters in with his revolt and his lucidity. He has\nforgotten how to hope. This hell of the present is his Kingdom at\nlast. All problems recover their sharp edge. Abstract evidence\nretreats before the poetry of forms and colors. Spiritual con\u0000icts\nbecome embodied and return to the abject and magni\u0000cent shelter\nof man’s heart. None of them is settled. But all are trans\u0000gured. Is\none going to die, escape by the leap, rebuild a mansion of ideas and\nforms to one’s own scale? Is one, on the contrary, going to take up\nthe heart-rending and marvelous wager of the absurd? Let’s make a\n\u0000nal e\u0000ort in this regard and draw all our conclusions. The body,\na\u0000ection, creation, action, human nobility will then resume their\nplaces in this mad world. At last man will again \u0000nd there the wine\nof the absurd and the bread of indi\u0000erence on which he feeds his\ngreatness.\nLet us insist again on the method: it is a matter of persisting. At a\ncertain point on his path the absurd man is tempted. History is not\nlacking in either religions or prophets, even without gods. He is\nasked to leap. All he can reply is that he doesn’t fully understand,\nthat it is not obvious. Indeed, he does not want to do anything but\nwhat he fully understands. He is assured that this is the sin of pride,\nbut he does not understand the notion of sin; that perhaps hell is in\nstore, but he has not enough imagination to visualize that strange\nfuture; that he is losing immortal life, but that seems to him an idle\nconsideration. An attempt is made to get him to admit his guilt. He\nfeels innocent. To tell the truth, that is all he feels—his irreparable\ninnocence. This is what allows him everything. Hence, what he\ndemands of himself is to live solely with what he knows, to\naccommodate himself to what is, and to bring in nothing that is not\ncertain. He is told that nothing is. But this at least is a certainty.\nAnd it is with this that he is concerned: he wants to \u0000nd out if it is\npossible to live without appeal.\n\f\n* * *\nNow I can broach the notion of suicide. It has already been felt\nwhat solution might be given. At this point the problem is reversed.\nIt was previously a question of \u0000nding out whether or not life had\nto have a meaning to be lived. It now becomes clear, on the\ncontrary, that it will be lived all the better if it has no meaning.\nLiving an experience, a particular fate, is accepting it fully. Now, no\none will live this fate, knowing it to be absurd, unless he does\neverything to keep before him that absurd brought to light by\nconsciousness. Negating one of the terms of the opposition on which\nhe lives amounts to escaping it. To abolish conscious revolt is to\nelude the problem. The theme of permanent revolution is thus\ncarried into individual experience. Living is keeping the absurd\nalive. Keeping it alive is, above all, contemplating it. Unlike\nEurydice, the absurd dies only when we turn away from it. One of\nthe only coherent philosophical positions is thus revolt. It is a\nconstant confrontation between man and his own obscurity. It is an\ninsistence upon an impossible transparency. It challenges the world\nanew every second. Just as danger provided man the unique\nopportunity of seizing awareness, so metaphysical revolt extends\nawareness to the whole of experience. It is that constant presence of\nman in his own eyes. It is not aspiration, for it is devoid of hope.\nThat revolt is the certainty of a crushing fate, without the\nresignation that ought to accompany it.\nThis is where it is seen to what a degree absurd experience is\nremote from suicide. It may be thought that suicide follows revolt—\nbut wrongly. For it does not represent the logical outcome of revolt.\nIt is just the contrary by the consent it presupposes. Suicide, like the\nleap, is acceptance at its extreme. Everything is over and man\nreturns to his essential history. His future, his unique and dreadful\nfuture—he sees and rushes toward it. In its way, suicide settles the\nabsurd. It engulfs the absurd in the same death. But I know that in\norder to keep alive, the absurd cannot be settled. It escapes suicide\nto the extent that it is simultaneously awareness and rejection of\ndeath. It is, at the extreme limit of the condemned man’s last\n\f\nthought, that shoelace that despite everything he sees a few yards\naway, on the very brink of his dizzying fall. The contrary of suicide,\nin fact, is the man condemned to death.\nThat revolt gives life its value. Spread out over the whole length\nof a life, it restores its majesty to that life. To a man devoid of\nblinders, there is no \u0000ner sight than that of the intelligence at grips\nwith a reality that transcends it. The sight of human pride is\nunequaled. No disparagement is of any use. That discipline that the\nmind imposes on itself, that will conjured up out of nothing, that\nface-to-face struggle have something exceptional about them. To\nimpoverish that reality whose inhumanity constitutes man’s majesty\nis tantamount to impoverishing him himself. I understand then why\nthe doctrines that explain everything to me also debilitate me at the\nsame time. They relieve me of the weight of my own life, and yet I\nmust carry it alone. At this juncture, I cannot conceive that a\nskeptical metaphysics can be joined to an ethics of renunciation.\nConsciousness and revolt, these rejections are the contrary of\nrenunciation. Everything that is indomitable and passionate in a\nhuman heart quickens them, on the contrary, with its own life. It is\nessential to die unreconciled and not of one’s own free will. Suicide\nis a repudiation. The absurd man can only drain everything to the\nbitter end, and deplete himself. The absurd is his extreme tension,\nwhich he maintains constantly by solitary e\u0000ort, for he knows that\nin that consciousness and in that day-to-day revolt he gives proof of\nhis only truth, which is de\u0000ance. This is a \u0000rst consequence.\n* * *\nIf I remain in that prearranged position which consists in drawing\nall the conclusions (and nothing else) involved in a newly\ndiscovered notion, I am faced with a second paradox. In order to\nremain faithful to that method, I have nothing to do with the\nproblem of metaphysical liberty. Knowing whether or not man is\nfree doesn’t interest me. I can experience only my own freedom. As\nto it, I can have no general notions, but merely a few clear insights.\nThe problem of “freedom as such” has no meaning. For it is linked\n\f\nin quite a di\u0000erent way with the problem of God. Knowing whether\nor not man is free involves knowing whether he can have a master.\nThe absurdity peculiar to this problem comes from the fact that the\nvery notion that makes the problem of freedom possible also takes\naway all its meaning. For in the presence of God there is less a\nproblem of freedom than a problem of evil. You know the\nalternative: either we are not free and God the all-powerful is\nresponsible for evil. Or we are free and responsible but God is not\nall-powerful. All the scholastic subtleties have neither added\nanything to nor subtracted anything from the acuteness of this\nparadox.\nThis is why I cannot get lost in the glori\u0000cation or the mere\nde\u0000nition of a notion which eludes me and loses its meaning as soon\nas it goes beyond the frame of reference of my individual\nexperience. I cannot understand what kind of freedom would be\ngiven me by a higher being. I have lost the sense of hierarchy. The\nonly conception of freedom I can have is that of the prisoner or the\nindividual in the midst of the State. The only one I know is freedom\nof thought and action. Now if the absurd cancels all my chances of\neternal freedom, it restores and magni\u0000es, on the other hand, my\nfreedom of action. That privation of hope and future means an\nincrease in man’s availability.\nBefore encountering the absurd, the everyday man lives with\naims, a concern for the future or for justi\u0000cation (with regard to\nwhom or what is not the question). He weighs his chances, he\ncounts on “someday,” his retirement or the labor of his sons. He still\nthinks that something in his life can be directed. In truth, he acts as\nif he were free, even if all the facts make a point of contradicting\nthat liberty. But after the absurd, everything is upset. That idea that\n“I am,” my way of acting as if everything has a meaning (even if,\non occasion, I said that nothing has)—all that is given the lie in\nvertiginous fashion by the absurdity of a possible death. Thinking of\nthe future, establishing aims for oneself, having preferences—all\nthis presupposes a belief in freedom, even if one occasionally\nascertains that one doesn’t feel it. But at that moment I am well\naware that that higher liberty, that freedom to be, which alone can\n\f\nserve as basis for a truth, does not exist. Death is there as the only\nreality. After death the chips are down. I am not even free, either,\nto perpetuate myself, but a slave, and, above all, a slave without\nhope of an eternal revolution, without recourse to contempt. And\nwho without revolution and without contempt can remain a slave?\nWhat freedom can exist in the fullest sense without assurance of\neternity?\nBut at the same time the absurd man realizes that hitherto he was\nbound to that postulate of freedom on the illusion of which he was\nliving. In a certain sense, that hampered him. To the extent to\nwhich he imagined a purpose to his life, he adapted himself to the\ndemands of a purpose to be achieved and became the slave of his\nliberty. Thus I could not act otherwise than as the father (or the\nengineer or the leader of a nation, or the post-o\u0000ce sub-clerk) that I\nam preparing to be. I think I can choose to be that rather than\nsomething else. I think so unconsciously, to be sure. But at the same\ntime I strengthen my postulate with the beliefs of those around me,\nwith the presumptions of my human environment (others are so\nsure of being free, and that cheerful mood is so contagious!).\nHowever far one may remain from any presumption, moral or\nsocial, one is partly in\u0000uenced by them and even, for the best\namong them (there are good and bad presumptions), one adapts\none’s life to them. Thus the absurd man realizes that he was not\nreally free. To speak clearly, to the extent to which I hope, to which\nI worry about a truth that might be individual to me, about a way\nof being or creating, to the extent to which I arrange my life and\nprove thereby that I accept its having a meaning, I create for myself\nbarriers between which I con\u0000ne my life. I do like so many\nbureaucrats of the mind and heart who only \u0000ll me with disgust and\nwhose only vice, I now see clearly, is to take man’s freedom\nseriously.\nThe absurd enlightens me on this point: there is no future.\nHenceforth this is the reason for my inner freedom. I shall use two\ncomparisons here. Mystics, to begin with, \u0000nd freedom in giving\nthemselves. By losing themselves in their god, by accepting his\nrules, they become secretly free. In spontaneously accepted slavery\n\f\nthey recover a deeper independence. But what does that freedom\nmean? It may be said, above all, that they feel free with regard to\nthemselves, and not so much free as liberated. Likewise, completely\nturned toward death (taken here as the most obvious absurdity), the\nabsurd man feels released from everything outside that passionate\nattention crystallizing in him. He enjoys a freedom with regard to\ncommon rules. It can be seen at this point that the initial themes of\nexistential philosophy keep their entire value, The return to\nconsciousness, the escape from everyday sleep represent the \u0000rst\nsteps of absurd freedom. But it is existential preaching that is alluded\nto, and with it that spiritual leap which basically escapes\nconsciousness. In the same way (this is my second comparison) the\nslaves of antiquity did not belong to themselves. But they knew that\nfreedom which consists in not feeling responsible.2 Death, too, has\npatrician hands which, while crushing, also liberate.\nLosing oneself in that bottomless certainty, feeling henceforth\nsu\u0000ciently remote from one’s own life to increase it and take a\nbroad view of it—this involves the principle of a liberation. Such\nnew independence has a de\u0000nite time limit, like any freedom of\naction. It does not write a check on eternity. But it takes the place\nof the illusions of freedom, which all stopped with death. The divine\navailability of the condemned man before whom the prison doors\nopen in a certain early dawn, that unbelievable disinterestedness\nwith regard to everything except for the pure \u0000ame of life—it is\nclear that death and the absurd are here the principles of the only\nreasonable freedom: that which a human heart can experience and\nlive. This is a second consequence. The absurd man thus catches\nsight of a burning and frigid, transparent and limited universe in\nwhich nothing is possible but everything is given, and beyond which\nall is collapse and nothingness. He can then decide to accept such a\nuniverse and draw from it his strength, his refusal to hope, and the\nunyielding evidence of a life without consolation.\n* * *\n\f\nBut what does life mean in such a universe? Nothing else for the\nmoment but indi\u0000erence to the future and a desire to use up\neverything that is given. Belief in the meaning of life always implies\na scale of values, a choice, our preferences. Belief in the absurd,\naccording to our de\u0000nitions, teaches the contrary. But this is worth\nexamining.\nKnowing whether or not one can live without appeal is all that\ninterests me. I do not want to get out of my depth. This aspect of\nlife being given me, can I adapt myself to it? Now, faced with this\nparticular concern, belief in the absurd is tantamount to substituting\nthe quantity of experiences for the quality. If I convince myself that\nthis life has no other aspect than that of the absurd, if I feel that its\nwhole equilibrium depends on that perpetual opposition between\nmy conscious revolt and the darkness in which it struggles, if I\nadmit that my freedom has no meaning except in relation to its\nlimited fate, then I must say that what counts is not the best living\nbut the most living. It is not up to me to wonder if this is vulgar or\nrevolting, elegant or deplorable. Once and for all, value judgments\nare discarded here in favor of factual judgments. I have merely to\ndraw the conclusions from what I can see and to risk nothing that is\nhypothetical. Supposing that living in this way were not honorable,\nthen true propriety would command me to be dishonorable.\nThe most living; in the broadest sense, that rule means nothing. It\ncalls for de\u0000nition. It seems to begin with the fact that the notion of\nquantity has not been su\u0000ciently explored. For it can account for a\nlarge share of human experience. A man’s rule of conduct and his\nscale of values have no meaning except through the quantity and\nvariety of experiences he has been in a position to accumulate.\nNow, the conditions of modern life impose on the majority of men\nthe same quantity of experiences and consequently the same\nprofound experience. To be sure, there must also be taken into\nconsideration the individual’s spontaneous contribution, the “given”\nelement in him. But I cannot judge of that, and let me repeat that\nmy rule here is to get along with the immediate evidence. I see,\nthen, that the individual character of a common code of ethics lies\nnot so much in the ideal importance of its basic principles as in the\n\f\nnorm of an experience that it is possible to measure. To stretch a\npoint somewhat, the Greeks had the code of their leisure just as we\nhave the code of our eight-hour day. But already many men among\nthe most tragic cause us to foresee that a longer experience changes\nthis table of values. They make us imagine that adventurer of the\neveryday who through mere quantity of experiences would break\nall records (I am purposely using this sports expression) and would\nthus win his own code of ethics.3 Yet let’s avoid romanticism and\njust ask ourselves what such an attitude may mean to a man with\nhis mind made up to take up his bet and to observe strictly what he\ntakes to be the rules of the game.\nBreaking all the records is \u0000rst and foremost being faced with the\nworld as often as possible. How can that be done without\ncontradictions and without playing on words? For on the one hand\nthe absurd teaches that all experiences are unimportant, and on the\nother it urges toward the greatest quantity of experiences. How,\nthen, can one fail to do as so many of those men I was speaking of\nearlier—choose the form of life that brings us the most possible of\nthat human matter, thereby introducing a scale of values that on the\nother hand one claims to reject?\nBut again it is the absurd and its contradictory life that teaches us.\nFor the mistake is thinking that that quantity of experiences\ndepends on the circumstances of our life when it depends solely on\nus. Here we have to be over-simple. To two men living the same\nnumber of years, the world always provides the same sum of\nexperiences. It is up to us to be conscious of them. Being aware of\none’s life, one’s revolt, one’s freedom, and to the maximum, is\nliving, and to the maximum. Where lucidity dominates, the scale of\nvalues becomes useless. Let’s be even more simple. Let us say that\nthe sole obstacle, the sole de\u0000ciency to be made good, is constituted\nby premature death. Thus it is that no depth, no emotion, no\npassion, and no sacri\u0000ce could render equal in the eyes of the\nabsurd man (even if he wished it so) a conscious life of forty years\nand a lucidity spread over sixty years.4 Madness and death are his\nirreparables. Man does not choose. The absurd and the extra life it\ninvolves therefore do not depend on man’s will, but on its contrary,\n\f\nwhich is death.5 Weighing words carefully, it is altogether a\nquestion of luck. One just has to be able to consent to this. There\nwill never be any substitute for twenty years of life and experience.\nBy what is an odd inconsistency in such an alert race, the Greeks\nclaimed that those who died young were beloved of the gods. And\nthat is true only if you are willing to believe that entering the\nridiculous world of the gods is forever losing the purest of joys,\nwhich is feeling, and feeling on this earth. The present and the\nsuccession of presents before a constantly conscious soul is the ideal\nof the absurd man. But the word “ideal” rings false in this\nconnection. It is not even his vocation, but merely the third\nconsequence of his reasoning. Having started from an anguished\nawareness of the inhuman, the meditation on the absurd returns at\nthe end of its itinerary to the very heart of the passionate \u0000ames of\nhuman revolt.6\n* * *\nThus I draw from the absurd three consequences, which are my\nrevolt, my freedom, and my passion. By the mere activity of\nconsciousness I transform into a rule of life what was an invitation\nto death—and I refuse suicide. I know, to be sure, the dull\nresonance that vibrates throughout these days. Yet I have but a\nword to say: that it is necessary. When Nietzsche writes: “It clearly\nseems that the chief thing in heaven and on earth is to obey at\nlength and in a single direction: in the long run there results\nsomething for which it is worth the trouble of living on this earth\nas, for example, virtue, art, music, the dance, reason, the mind—\nsomething that trans\u0000gures, something delicate, mad, or divine,” he\nelucidates the rule of a really distinguished code of ethics. But he\nalso points the way of the absurd man. Obeying the \u0000ame is both\nthe easiest and the hardest thing to do. However, it is good for man\nto judge himself occasionally. He is alone in being able to do so.\n“Prayer,” says Alain, “is when night descends over thought.” “But\nthe mind must meet the night,” reply the mystics and the\nexistentials. Yes, indeed, but not that night that is born under closed\n\f\neyelids and through the mere will of man—dark, impenetrable night\nthat the mind calls up in order to plunge into it. If it must encounter\na night, let it be rather that of despair, which remains lucid—polar\nnight, vigil of the mind, whence will arise perhaps that white and\nvirginal brightness which outlines every object in the light of the\nintelligence. At that degree, equivalence encounters passionate\nunderstanding. Then it is no longer even a question of judging the\nexistential leap. It resumes its place amid the age-old fresco of\nhuman attitudes. For the spectator, if he is conscious, that leap is\nstill absurd. In so far as it thinks it solves the paradox, it reinstates\nit intact. On this score, it is stirring. On this score, everything\nresumes its place and the absurd world is reborn in all its splendor\nand diversity.\nBut it is bad to stop, hard to be satis\u0000ed with a single way of\nseeing, to go without contradiction, perhaps the most subtle of all\nspiritual forces. The preceding merely de\u0000nes a way of thinking.\nBut the point is to live.\n1 From the point of view of the relative value of truth. On the other hand, from the point of\nview of virile behavior, this scholar’s fragility may well make us smile.\n2 Let us not miss this opportunity to point out the relative character of this essay. Suicide\nmay indeed be related to much more honorable considerations—for example, the political\nsuicides of protest, as they were called, during the Chinese revolution.\n3 I have heard of an emulator of Peregrinos, a post-war writer who, after having \u0000nished\nhis \u0000rst book, committed suicide to attract attention to his work. Attention was in fact\nattracted, but the book was judged no good.\n4 But not in the proper sense. This is not a de\u0000nition, but rather an enumeration of the\nfeelings that may admit of the absurd. Still, the enumeration \u0000nished, the absurd has\nnevertheless not been exhausted.\n5 Apropos of the notion of exception particularly and against Aristotle.\n6 It may be thought that I am neglecting here the essential problem, that of faith. But I am\nnot examining the philosophy of Kierkegaard or of Chestov or, later on, of Husserl (this\nwould call for a di\u0000erent place and a di\u0000erent attitude of mind); I am simply borrowing a\n\f\ntheme from them and examining whether its consequences can \u0000t the already established\nrules. It is merely a matter of persistence.\n7 I did not say “excludes God,” which would still amount to asserting.\n8 Let me assert again: it is not the a\u0000rmation of God that is questioned here, but rather the\nlogic leading to that a\u0000rmation.\n9 Even the most rigorous epistemologies imply metaphysics. And to such a degree that the\nmetaphysic of many contemporary thinkers consists in having nothing but an\nepistemology.\n1 A.—At that time reason had to adapt itself or die. It adapts itself. With Plotinus, after\nbeing logical it becomes æsthetic. Metaphor takes the place of the syllogism.\nB.—Moreover, this is not Plotinus’ only contribution to phenomenology. This whole\nattitude is already contained in the concept so dear to the Alexandrian thinker that there is\nnot only an idea of man but also an idea of Socrates.\n2 I am concerned here with a factual comparison, not with an apology of humility. The\nabsurd man is the contrary of the reconciled man.\n3 Quantity sometimes constitutes quality. If I can believe the latest restatements of scienti\u0000c\ntheory, all matter is constituted by centers of energy. Their greater or lesser quantity makes\nits speci\u0000city more or less remarkable. A billion ions and one ion di\u0000er not only in quantity\nbut also in quality. It is easy to \u0000nd an analogy in human experience.\n4 Same re\u0000ection on a notion as di\u0000erent as the idea of eternal nothingness. It neither adds\nanything to nor subtracts anything from reality. In psychological experience of\nnothingness, it is by the consideration of what will happen in two thousand years that our\nown nothingness truly takes on meaning. In one of its aspects, eternal nothingness is made\nup precisely of the sum of lives to come which will not be ours.\n5 The will is only the agent here: it tends to maintain consciousness. It provides a discipline\nof life, and that is appreciable.\n6 What matters is coherence. We start out here from acceptance of the world. But Oriental\nthought teaches that one can indulge in the same e\u0000ort of logic by choosing against the\nworld. That is just as legitimate and gives this essay its perspectives and its limits. But\nwhen the negation of the world is pursued just as rigorously, one often achieves (in certain\nVedantic schools) similar results regarding, for instance, the indi\u0000erence of works. In a\nbook of great importance, Le Choix, Jean Grenier establishes in this way a veritable\n“philosophy of indi\u0000erence.”\n\f\n“M\nTHE ABSURD MAN\nIf Stavrogin believes, he does not think he believes. If he does not\nbelieve, he does not think he does not believe.\n—The Possessed\nY FIELD,” said Goethe, “is time.” That is indeed the absurd\nspeech. What, in fact, is the absurd man? He who,\nwithout negating it, does nothing for the eternal. Not that nostalgia\nis foreign to him. But he prefers his courage and his reasoning. The\n\u0000rst teaches him to live without appeal and to get along with what\nhe has; the second informs him of his limits. Assured of his\ntemporally limited freedom, of his revolt devoid of future, and of\nhis mortal consciousness, he lives out his adventure within the span\nof his lifetime. That is his \u0000eld, that is his action, which he shields\nfrom any judgment but his own. A greater life cannot mean for him\nanother life. That would be unfair. I am not even speaking here of\nthat paltry eternity that is called posterity. Mme Roland relied on\nherself. That rashness was taught a lesson. Posterity is glad to quote\nher remark, but forgets to judge it. Mme Roland is indi\u0000erent to\nposterity.\nThere can be no question of holding forth on ethics. I have seen\npeople behave badly with great morality and I note every day that\nintegrity has no need of rules. There is but one moral code that the\nabsurd man can accept, the one that is not separated from God: the\none that is dictated. But it so happens that he lives outside that God.\nAs for the others (I mean also immoralism), the absurd man sees\nnothing in them but justi\u0000cations and he has nothing to justify. I\nstart out here from the principle of his innocence.\nThat innocence is to be feared. “Everything is permitted,”\nexclaims Ivan Karamazov. That, too, smacks of the absurd. But on\ncondition that it not be taken in the vulgar sense. I don’t know\n\f\nwhether or not it has been su\u0000ciently pointed out that it is not an\noutburst of relief or of joy, but rather a bitter acknowledgment of a\nfact. The certainty of a God giving a meaning to life far surpasses in\nattractiveness the ability to behave badly with impunity. The choice\nwould not be hard to make. But there is no choice, and that is\nwhere the bitterness comes in. The absurd does not liberate; it\nbinds. It does not authorize all actions. “Everything is permitted”\ndoes not mean that nothing is forbidden. The absurd merely confers\nan equivalence on the consequences of those actions. It does not\nrecommend crime, for this would be childish, but it restores to\nremorse its futility. Likewise, if all experiences are indi\u0000erent, that\nof duty is as legitimate as any other. One can be virtuous through a\nwhim.\nAll systems of morality are based on the idea that an action has\nconsequences that legitimize or cancel it. A mind imbued with the\nabsurd merely judges that those consequences must be considered\ncalmly. It is ready to pay up. In other words, there may be\nresponsible persons, but there are no guilty ones, in its opinion. At\nvery most, such a mind will consent to use past experience as a\nbasis for its future actions. Time will prolong time, and life will\nserve life. In this \u0000eld that is both limited and bulging with\npossibilities, everything in himself, except his lucidity, seems\nunforeseeable to him. What rule, then, could emanate from that\nunreasonable order? The only truth that might seem instructive to\nhim is not formal: it comes to life and unfolds in men. The absurd\nmind cannot so much expect ethical rules at the end of its reasoning\nas, rather, illustrations and the breath of human lives. The few\nfollowing images are of this type. They prolong the absurd\nreasoning by giving it a speci\u0000c attitude and their warmth.\nDo I need to develop the idea that an example is not necessarily\nan example to be followed (even less so, if possible, in the absurd\nworld) and that these illustrations are not therefore models? Besides\nthe fact that a certain vocation is required for this, one becomes\nridiculous, with all due allowance, when drawing from Rousseau the\nconclusion that one must walk on all fours and from Nietzsche that\none must maltreat one’s mother. “It is essential to be absurd,”\n\f\nwrites a modern author, “it is not essential to be a dupe.” The\nattitudes of which I shall treat can assume their whole meaning only\nthrough consideration of their contraries. A sub-clerk in the post\no\u0000ce is the equal of a conqueror if consciousness is common to\nthem. All experiences are indi\u0000erent in this regard. There are some\nthat do either a service or a disservice to man. They do him a\nservice if he is conscious. Otherwise, that has no importance: a\nman’s failures imply judgment, not of circumstances, but of himself.\nI am choosing solely men who aim only to expend themselves or\nwhom I see to be expending themselves. That has no further\nimplications. For the moment I want to speak only of a world in\nwhich thoughts, like lives, are devoid of future. Everything that\nmakes man work and get excited utilizes hope. The sole thought\nthat is not mendacious is therefore a sterile thought. In the absurd\nworld the value of a notion or of a life is measured by its sterility.\nDon Juanism\nIf it were su\u0000cient to love, things would be too easy. The more\none loves, the stronger the absurd grows. It is not through lack of\nlove that Don Juan goes from woman to woman. It is ridiculous to\nrepresent him as a mystic in quest of total love. But it is indeed\nbecause he loves them with the same passion and each time with his\nwhole self that he must repeat his gift and his profound quest.\nWhence each woman hopes to give him what no one has ever given\nhim. Each time they are utterly wrong and merely manage to make\nhim feel the need of that repetition. “At last,” exclaims one of them,\n“I have given you love.” Can we be surprised that Don Juan laughs\nat this? “At last? No,” he says, “but once more.” Why should it be\nessential to love rarely in order to love much?\n* * *\nIs Don Juan melancholy? This is not likely. I shall barely have\nrecourse to the legend. That laugh, the conquering insolence, that\n\f\nplayfulness and love of the theater are all clear and joyous. Every\nhealthy creature tends to multiply himself. So it is with Don Juan.\nBut, furthermore, melancholy people have two reasons for being so:\nthey don’t know or they hope. Don Juan knows and does not hope.\nHe reminds one of those artists who know their limits, never go\nbeyond them, and in that precarious interval in which they take\ntheir spiritual stand enjoy all the wonderful ease of masters. And\nthat is indeed genius: the intelligence that knows its frontiers. Up to\nthe frontier of physical death Don Juan is ignorant of melancholy.\nThe moment he knows, his laugh bursts forth and makes one\nforgive everything. He was melancholy at the time when he hoped.\nToday, on the mouth of that woman he recognizes the bitter and\ncomforting taste of the only knowledge. Bitter? Barely: that\nnecessary imperfection that makes happiness perceptible!\nIt is quite false to try to see in Don Juan a man brought up on\nEcclesiastes. For nothing is vanity to him except the hope of another\nlife. He proves this because he gambles that other life against\nheaven itself. Longing for desire killed by satisfaction, that\ncommonplace of the impotent man, does not belong to him. That is\nall right for Faust, who believed in God enough to sell himself to\nthe devil. For Don Juan the thing is simpler. Molina’s Burlador ever\nreplies to the threats of hell: “What a long respite you give me!”\nWhat comes after death is futile, and what a long succession of days\nfor whoever knows how to be alive! Faust craved worldly goods;\nthe poor man had only to stretch out his hand. It already amounted\nto selling his soul when he was unable to gladden it. As for satiety,\nDon Juan insists upon it, on the contrary. If he leaves a woman it is\nnot absolutely because he has ceased to desire her. A beautiful\nwoman is always desirable. But he desires another, and no, this is\nnot the same thing.\nThis life grati\u0000es his every wish, and nothing is worse than losing\nit. This madman is a great wise man. But men who live on hope do\nnot thrive in this universe where kindness yields to generosity,\na\u0000ection to virile silence, and communion to solitary courage. And\nall hasten to say: “He was a weakling, an idealist or a saint.” One\nhas to disparage the greatness that insults.\n\f\n* * *\nPeople are su\u0000ciently annoyed (or that smile of complicity that\ndebases what it admires) by Don Juan’s speeches and by that same\nremark that he uses on all women. But to anyone who seeks\nquantity in his joys, the only thing that matters is e\u0000cacy. What is\nthe use of complicating the passwords that have stood the test? No\none, neither the woman nor the man, listens to them, but rather to\nthe voice that pronounces them. They are the rule, the convention,\nand the courtesy. After they are spoken the most important still\nremains to be done. Don Juan is already getting ready for it. Why\nshould he give himself a problem in morality? He is not like\nMilosz’s Mañara, who damns himself through a desire to be a saint.\nHell for him is a thing to be provoked. He has but one reply to\ndivine wrath, and that is human honor: “I have honor,” he says to\nthe Commander, “and I am keeping my promise because I am a\nknight.” But it would be just as great an error to make an\nimmoralist of him. In this regard, he is “like everyone else”: he has\nthe moral code of his likes and dislikes. Don Juan can be properly\nunderstood only by constant reference to what he commonly\nsymbolizes: the ordinary seducer and the sexual athlete. He is an\nordinary seducer.1 Except for the di\u0000erence that he is conscious, and\nthat is why he is absurd. A seducer who has become lucid will not\nchange for all that. Seducing is his condition in life. Only in novels\ndoes one change condition or become better. Yet it can be said that\nat the same time nothing is changed and everything is transformed.\nWhat Don Juan realizes in action is an ethic of quantity, whereas\nthe saint, on the contrary, tends toward quality. Not to believe in\nthe profound meaning of things belongs to the absurd man. As for\nthose cordial or wonder-struck faces, he eyes them, stores them up,\nand does not pause over them. Time keeps up with him. The absurd\nman is he who is not apart from time. Don Juan does not think of\n“collecting” women. He exhausts their number and with them his\nchances of life. “Collecting” amounts to being capable of living o\u0000\none’s past. But he rejects regret, that other form of hope. He is\nincapable of looking at portraits.\n\f\n* * *\nIs he sel\u0000sh for all that? In his way, probably. But here, too, it is\nessential to understand one another. There are those who are made\nfor living and those who are made for loving. At least Don Juan\nwould be inclined to say so. But he would do so in a very few words\nsuch as he is capable of choosing. For the love we are speaking of\nhere is clothed in illusions of the eternal. As all the specialists in\npassion teach us, there is no eternal love but what is thwarted.\nThere is scarcely any passion without struggle. Such a love\nculminates only in the ultimate contradiction of death. One must be\nWerther or nothing. There, too, there are several ways of\ncommitting suicide, one of which is the total gift and forgetfulness\nof self. Don Juan, as well as anyone else, knows that this can be\nstirring. But he is one of the very few who know that this is not the\nimportant thing. He knows just as well that those who turn away\nfrom all personal life through a great love enrich themselves\nperhaps but certainly impoverish those their love has chosen. A\nmother or a passionate wife necessarily has a closed heart, for it is\nturned away from the world. A single emotion, a single creature, a\nsingle face, but all is devoured. Quite a di\u0000erent love disturbs Don\nJuan, and this one is liberating. It brings with it all the faces in the\nworld, and its tremor comes from the fact that it knows itself to be\nmortal. Don Juan has chosen to be nothing.\nFor him it is a matter of seeing clearly. We call love what binds\nus to certain creatures only by reference to a collective way of\nseeing for which books and legends are responsible. But of love I\nknow only that mixture of desire, a\u0000ection, and intelligence that\nbinds me to this or that creature. That compound is not the same for\nanother person. I do not have the right to cover all these\nexperiences with the same name. This exempts one from conducting\nthem with the same gestures. The absurd man multiplies here again\nwhat he cannot unify. Thus he discovers a new way of being which\nliberates him at least as much as it liberates those who approach\nhim. There is no noble love but that which recognizes itself to be\nboth short-lived and exceptional. All those deaths and all those\n\f\nrebirths gathered together as in a sheaf make up for Don Juan the\n\u0000owering of his life. It is his way of giving and of vivifying. I let it\nbe decided whether or not one can speak of sel\u0000shness.\n* * *\nI think at this point of all those who absolutely insist that Don\nJuan be punished. Not only in another life, but even in this one. I\nthink of all those tales, legends, and laughs about the aged Don\nJuan. But Don Juan is already ready. To a conscious man old age\nand what it portends are not a surprise. Indeed, he is conscious only\nin so far as he does not conceal its horror from himself. There was\nin Athens a temple dedicated to old age. Children were taken there.\nAs for Don Juan, the more people laugh at him, the more his \u0000gure\nstands out. Thereby he rejects the one the romantics lent him. No\none wants to laugh at that tormented, pitiful Don Juan. He is pitied;\nheaven itself will redeem him? But that’s not it. In the universe of\nwhich Don Juan has a glimpse, ridicule too is included. He would\nconsider it normal to be chastised. That is the rule of the game.\nAnd, indeed, it is typical of his nobility to have accepted all the\nrules of the game. Yet he knows he is right and that there can be no\nquestion of punishment. A fate is not a punishment.\nThat is his crime, and how easy it is to understand why the men\nof God call down punishment on his head. He achieves a knowledge\nwithout illusions which negates everything they profess. Loving and\npossessing, conquering and consuming—that is his way of knowing.\n(There is signi\u0000cance in that favorite Scriptural word that calls the\ncarnal act “knowing.”) He is their worst enemy to the extent that he\nis ignorant of them. A chronicler relates that the true Burlador died\nassassinated by Franciscans who wanted “to put an end to the\nexcesses and blasphemies of Don Juan, whose birth assured him\nimpunity.” Then they proclaimed that heaven had struck him down.\nNo one has proved that strange end. Nor has anyone proved the\ncontrary. But without wondering if it is probable, I can say that it is\nlogical. I want merely to single out at this point the word “birth”\nand to play on words: it was the fact of living that assured his\n\f\ninnocence. It was from death alone that he derived a guilt now\nbecome legendary.\nWhat else does that stone Commander signify, that cold statue set\nin motion to punish the blood and courage that dared to think? All\nthe powers of eternal Reason, of order, of universal morality, all the\nforeign grandeur of a God open to wrath are summed up in him.\nThat gigantic and soulless stone merely symbolizes the forces that\nDon Juan negated forever. But the Commander’s mission stops\nthere. The thunder and lightning can return to the imitation heaven\nwhence they were called forth. The real tragedy takes place quite\napart from them. No, it was not under a stone hand that Don Juan\nmet his death. I am inclined to believe in the legendary bravado, in\nthat mad laughter of the healthy man provoking a non-existent God.\nBut, above all, I believe that on that evening when Don Juan was\nwaiting at Anna’s the Commander didn’t come, and that after\nmidnight the blasphemer must have felt the dreadful bitterness of\nthose who have been right. I accept even more readily the account\nof his life that has him eventually burying himself in a monastery.\nNot that the edifying aspect of the story can be considered probable.\nWhat refuge can he go ask of God? But this symbolizes rather the\nlogical outcome of a life completely imbued with the absurd, the\ngrim ending of an existence turned toward short-lived joys. At this\npoint sensual pleasure winds up in asceticism. It is essential to\nrealize that they may be, as it were, the two aspects of the same\ndestitution. What more ghastly image can be called up than that of\na man betrayed by his body who, simply because he did not die in\ntime, lives out the comedy while awaiting the end, face to face with\nthat God he does not adore, serving him as he served life, kneeling\nbefore a void and arms outstretched toward a heaven without\neloquence that he knows to be also without depth?\nI see Don Juan in a cell of one of those Spanish monasteries lost\non a hilltop. And if he contemplates anything at all, it is not the\nghosts of past loves, but perhaps, through a narrow slit in the sun-\nbaked wall, some silent Spanish plain, a noble, soulless land in\nwhich he recognizes himself. Yes, it is on this melancholy and\n\f\nradiant image that the curtain must be rung down. The ultimate\nend, awaited but never desired, the ultimate end is negligible.\nDrama\n“The play’s the thing,” says Hamlet, “wherein I’ll catch the\nconscience of the king.” “Catch” is indeed the word. For conscience\nmoves swiftly or withdraws within itself. It has to be caught on the\nwing, at that barely perceptible moment when it glances \u0000eetingly\nat itself. The everyday man does not enjoy tarrying. Everything, on\nthe contrary, hurries him onward. But at the same time nothing\ninterests him more than himself, especially his potentialities.\nWhence his interest in the theater, in the show, where so many fates\nare o\u0000ered him, where he can accept the poetry without feeling the\nsorrow. There at least can be recognized the thoughtless man, and\nhe continues to hasten toward some hope or other. The absurd man\nbegins where that one leaves o\u0000, where, ceasing to admire the play,\nthe mind wants to enter in. Entering into all these lives,\nexperiencing them in their diversity, amounts to acting them out. I\nam not saying that actors in general obey that impulse, that they\nare absurd men, but that their fate is an absurd fate which might\ncharm and attract a lucid heart. It is necessary to establish this in\norder to grasp without misunderstanding what will follow.\nThe actor’s realm is that of the \u0000eeting. Of all kinds of fame, it is\nknown, his is the most ephemeral. At least, this is said in\nconversation. But all kinds of fame are ephemeral. From the point\nof view of Sirius, Goethe’s works in ten thousand years will be dust\nand his name forgotten. Perhaps a handful of archæologists will\nlook for “evidence” as to our era. That idea has always contained a\nlesson. Seriously meditated upon, it reduces our perturbations to the\nprofound nobility that is found in indi\u0000erence. Above all, it directs\nour concerns toward what is most certain—that is, toward the\nimmediate. Of all kinds of fame the least deceptive is the one that is\nlived.\n\f\nHence the actor has chosen multiple fame, the fame that is\nhallowed and tested. From the fact that everything is to die\nsomeday he draws the best conclusion. An actor succeeds or does\nnot succeed. A writer has some hope even if he is not appreciated.\nHe assumes that his works will bear witness to what he was. At best\nthe actor will leave us a photograph, and nothing of what he was\nhimself, his gestures and his silences, his gasping or his panting with\nlove, will come down to us. For him, not to be known is not to act,\nand not acting is dying a hundred times with all the creatures he\nwould have brought to life or resuscitated.\n* * *\nWhy should we be surprised to \u0000nd a \u0000eeting fame built upon the\nmost ephemeral of creations? The actor has three hours to be Iago\nor Alceste, Phèdre or Gloucester. In that short space of time he\nmakes them come to life and die on \u0000fty square yards of boards.\nNever has the absurd been so well illustrated or at such length.\nWhat more revelatory epitome can be imagined than those\nmarvelous lives, those exceptional and total destinies unfolding for\na few hours within a stage set? O\u0000 the stage, Sigismundo ceases to\ncount. Two hours later he is seen dining out. Then it is, perhaps,\nthat life is a dream. But after Sigismundo comes another. The hero\nsu\u0000ering from uncertainty takes the place of the man roaring for his\nrevenge. By thus sweeping over centuries and minds, by miming\nman as he can be and as he is, the actor has much in common with\nthat other absurd individual, the traveler. Like him, he drains\nsomething and is constantly on the move. He is a traveler in time\nand, for the best, the hunted traveler, pursued by souls. If ever the\nethics of quantity could \u0000nd sustenance, it is indeed on that strange\nstage. To what degree the actor bene\u0000ts from the characters is hard\nto say. But that is not the important thing. It is merely a matter of\nknowing how far he identi\u0000es himself with those irreplaceable\nlives. It often happens that he carries them with him, that they\nsomewhat over\u0000ow the time and place in which they were born.\nThey accompany the actor, who cannot very readily separate\n\f\nhimself from what he has been. Occasionally when reaching for his\nglass he resumes Hamlet’s gesture of raising his cup. No, the\ndistance separating him from the creatures into whom he infuses\nlife is not so great. He abundantly illustrates every month or every\nday that so suggestive truth that there is no frontier between what a\nman wants to be and what he is. Always concerned with better\nrepresenting, he demonstrates to what a degree appearing creates\nbeing. For that is his art—to simulate absolutely, to project himself\nas deeply as possible into lives that are not his own. At the end of\nhis e\u0000ort his vocation becomes clear: to apply himself\nwholeheartedly to being nothing or to being several. The narrower\nthe limits allotted him for creating his character, the more necessary\nhis talent. He will die in three hours under the mask he has assumed\ntoday. Within three hours he must experience and express a whole\nexceptional life. That is called losing oneself to \u0000nd oneself. In\nthose three hours he travels the whole course of the dead-end path\nthat the man in the audience takes a lifetime to cover.\n* * *\nA mime of the ephemeral, the actor trains and perfects himself\nonly in appearances. The theatrical convention is that the heart\nexpresses itself and communicates itself only through gestures and\nin the body—or through the voice, which is as much of the soul as\nof the body. The rule of that art insists that everything be magni\u0000ed\nand translated into \u0000esh. If it were essential on the stage to love as\npeople really love, to employ that irreplaceable voice of the heart,\nto look as people contemplate in life, our speech would be in code.\nBut here silences must make themselves heard. Love speaks up\nlouder, and immobility itself becomes spectacular. The body is king.\nNot everyone can be “theatrical,” and this unjustly maligned word\ncovers a whole æsthetic and a whole ethic. Half a man’s life is spent\nin implying, in turning away, and in keeping silent. Here the actor\nis the intruder. He breaks the spell chaining that soul, and at last the\npassions can rush onto their stage. They speak in every gesture;\nthey live only through shouts and cries. Thus the actor creates his\n\f\ncharacters for display. He outlines or sculptures them and slips into\ntheir imaginary form, transfusing his blood into their phantoms. I\nam of course speaking of great drama, the kind that gives the actor\nan opportunity to ful\u0000ll his wholly physical fate. Take Shakespeare,\nfor instance. In that impulsive drama the physical passions lead the\ndance. They explain everything. Without them all would collapse.\nNever would King Lear keep the appointment set by madness\nwithout the brutal gesture that exiles Cordelia and condemns Edgar.\nIt is just that the unfolding of that tragedy should thenceforth be\ndominated by madness. Souls are given over to the demons and\ntheir saraband. No fewer than four madmen: one by trade, another\nby intention, and the last two through su\u0000ering—four disordered\nbodies, four unutterable aspects of a single condition.\nThe very scale of the human body is inadequate. The mask and\nthe buskin, the make-up that reduces and accentuates the face in its\nessential elements, the costume that exaggerates and simpli\u0000es—\nthat universe sacri\u0000ces everything to appearance and is made solely\nfor the eye. Through an absurd miracle, it is the body that also\nbrings knowledge. I should never really understand Iago unless I\nplayed his part. It is not enough to hear him, for I grasp him only at\nthe moment when I see him. Of the absurd character the actor\nconsequently has the monotony, that single, oppressive silhouette,\nsimultaneously strange and familiar, that he carries about from hero\nto hero. There, too, the great dramatic work contributes to this\nunity of tone.2 This is where the actor contradicts himself: the same\nand yet so various, so many souls summed up in a single body. Yet\nit is the absurd contradiction itself, that individual who wants to\nachieve everything and live everything, that useless attempt, that\nine\u0000ectual persistence. What always contradicts itself nevertheless\njoins in him. He is at that point where body and mind converge,\nwhere the mind, tired of its defeats, turns toward its most faithful\nally. “And blest are those,” says Hamlet, “whose blood and\njudgment are so well commingled that they are not a pipe for\nfortune’s \u0000nger to sound what stop she please.”\n* * *"

    "raw_text": "How could the Church have failed to condemn such a practice on\nthe part of the actor? She repudiated in that art the heretical\nmultiplication of souls, the emotional debauch, the scandalous\npresumption of a mind that objects to living but one life and hurls\nitself into all forms of excess. She proscribed in them that\npreference for the present and that triumph of Proteus which are\nthe negation of everything she teaches. Eternity is not a game. A\nmind foolish enough to prefer a comedy to eternity has lost its\nsalvation. Between “everywhere” and “forever” there is no\ncompromise. Whence that much maligned profession can give rise\nto a tremendous spiritual con\u0000ict. “What matters,” said Nietzsche,\n“is not eternal life but eternal vivacity.” All drama is, in fact, in this\nchoice.\nAdrienne Lecouvreur on her deathbed was willing to confess and\nreceive communion, but refused to abjure her profession. She\nthereby lost the bene\u0000t of the confession. Did this not amount, in\ne\u0000ect, to choosing her absorbing passion in preference to God? And\nthat woman in the death throes refusing in tears to repudiate what\nshe called her art gave evidence of a greatness that she never\nachieved behind the footlights. This was her \u0000nest role and the\nhardest one to play. Choosing between heaven and a ridiculous\n\u0000delity, preferring oneself to eternity or losing oneself in God is the\nage-old tragedy in which each must play his part.\nThe actors of the era knew they were excommunicated. Entering\nthe profession amounted to choosing Hell. And the Church discerned\nin them her worst enemies. A few men of letters protest: “What!\nRefuse the last rites to Molière!” But that was just, and especially in\none who died onstage and \u0000nished under the actor’s make-up a life\nentirely devoted to dispersion. In his case genius is invoked, which\nexcuses everything. But genius excuses nothing, just because it\nrefuses to do so.\nThe actor knew at that time what punishment was in store for\nhim. But what signi\u0000cance could such vague threats have compared\nto the \u0000nal punishment that life itself was reserving for him? This\nwas the one that he felt in advance and accepted wholly. To the\nactor as to the absurd man, a premature death is irreparable.\n\f\nNothing can make up for the sum of faces and centuries he would\notherwise have traversed. But in any case, one has to die. For the\nactor is doubtless everywhere, but time sweeps him along, too, and\nmakes its impression with him.\nIt requires but a little imagination to feel what an actor’s fate\nmeans. It is in time that he makes up and enumerates his characters.\nIt is in time likewise that he learns to dominate them. The greater\nnumber of di\u0000erent lives he has lived, the more aloof he can be\nfrom them. The time comes when he must die to the stage and for\nthe world. What he has lived faces him. He sees clearly. He feels the\nharrowing and irreplaceable quality of that adventure. He knows\nand can now die. There are homes for aged actors.\nConquest\n“No,” says the conqueror, “don’t assume that because I love\naction I have had to forget how to think. On the contrary I can\nthoroughly de\u0000ne what I believe. For I believe it \u0000rmly and I see it\nsurely and clearly. Beware of those who say: ‘I know this too well\nto be able to express it.’ For if they cannot do so, this is because\nthey don’t know it or because out of laziness they stopped at the\nouter crust.\n“I have not many opinions. At the end of a life man notices that\nhe has spent years becoming sure of a single truth. But a single\ntruth, if it is obvious, is enough to guide an existence. As for me, I\ndecidedly have something to say about the individual. One must\nspeak of him bluntly and, if need be, with the appropriate\ncontempt.\n“A man is more a man through the things he keeps to himself\nthan through those he says. There are many that I shall keep to\nmyself. But I \u0000rmly believe that all those who have judged the\nindividual have done so with much less experience than we on\nwhich to base their judgment. The intelligence, the stirring\nintelligence perhaps foresaw what it was essential to note. But the\nera, its ruins, and its blood overwhelm us with facts. It was possible\n\f\nfor ancient nations, and even for more recent ones down to our\nmachine age, to weigh one against the other the virtues of society\nand of the individual, to try to \u0000nd out which was to serve the\nother. To begin with, that was possible by virtue of that stubborn\naberration in man’s heart according to which human beings were\ncreated to serve or be served. In the second place, it was possible\nbecause neither society nor the individual had yet revealed all their\nability.\n“I have seen bright minds express astonishment at the\nmasterpieces of Dutch painters born at the height of the bloody\nwars in Flanders, be amazed by the prayers of Silesian mystics\nbrought up during the frightful Thirty Years’ War. Eternal values\nsurvive secular turmoils before their astonished eyes. But there has\nbeen progress since. The painters of today are deprived of such\nserenity. Even if they have basically the heart the creator needs—I\nmean the closed heart—it is of no use; for everyone, including the\nsaint himself, is mobilized. This is perhaps what I have felt most\ndeeply. At every form that miscarries in the trenches, at every\noutline, metaphor, or prayer crushed under steel, the eternal loses a\nround. Conscious that I cannot stand aloof from my time, I have\ndecided to be an integral part of it. This is why I esteem the\nindividual only because he strikes me as ridiculous and humiliated.\nKnowing that there are no victorious causes, I have a liking for lost\ncauses: they require an uncontaminated soul, equal to its defeat as\nto its temporary victories. For anyone who feels bound up with this\nworld’s fate, the clash of civilizations has something agonizing\nabout it. I have made that anguish mine at the same time that I\nwanted to join in. Between history and the eternal I have chosen\nhistory because I like certainties. Of it, at least, I am certain, and\nhow can I deny this force crushing me?\n“There always comes a time when one must choose between\ncontemplation and action. This is called becoming a man. Such\nwrenches are dreadful. But for a proud heart there can be no\ncompromise. There is God or time, that cross or this sword. This\nworld has a higher meaning that transcends its worries, or nothing\nis true but those worries. One must live with time and die with it,\n\f\nor else elude it for a greater life. I know that one can compromise\nand live in the world while believing in the eternal. That is called\naccepting. But I loathe this term and want all or nothing. If I choose\naction, don’t think that contemplation is like an unknown country to\nme. But it cannot give me everything, and, deprived of the eternal,\nI want to ally myself with time. I do not want to put down to my\naccount either nostalgia or bitterness, and I merely want to see\nclearly. I tell you, tomorrow you will be mobilized. For you and for\nme that is a liberation. The individual can do nothing and yet he can\ndo everything. In that wonderful unattached state you understand\nwhy I exalt and crush him at one and the same time. It is the world\nthat pulverizes him and I who liberate him. I provide him with all\nhis rights.\n* * *\n“Conquerors know that action is in itself useless. There is but one\nuseful action, that of remaking man and the earth. I shall never\nremake men. But one must do ‘as if.’ For the path of struggle leads\nme to the \u0000esh. Even humiliated, the \u0000esh is my only certainty. I\ncan live only on it. The creature is my native land. This is why I\nhave chosen this absurd and ine\u0000ectual e\u0000ort. This is why I am on\nthe side of the struggle. The epoch lends itself to this, as I have said.\nHitherto the greatness of a conqueror was geographical. It was\nmeasured by the extent of the conquered territories. There is a\nreason why the word has changed in meaning and has ceased to\nsignify the victorious general. The greatness has changed camp. It\nlies in protest and the blind-alley sacri\u0000ce. There, too, it is not\nthrough a preference for defeat. Victory would be desirable. But\nthere is but one victory, and it is eternal. That is the one I shall\nnever have. That is where I stumble and cling. A revolution is\nalways accomplished against the gods, beginning with the\nrevolution of Prometheus, the \u0000rst of modern conquerors. It is\nman’s demands made against his fate; the demands of the poor are\nbut a pretext. Yet I can seize that spirit only in its historical act, and\nthat is where I make contact with it. Don’t assume, however, that I\n\f\ntake pleasure in it: opposite the essential contradiction, I maintain\nmy human contradiction. I establish my lucidity in the midst of\nwhat negates it. I exalt man before what crushes him, and my\nfreedom, my revolt, and my passion come together then in that\ntension, that lucidity, and that vast repetition.\n“Yes, man is his own end. And he is his only end. If he aims to be\nsomething, it is in this life. Now I know it only too well.\nConquerors sometimes talk of vanquishing and overcoming. But it is\nalways ‘overcoming oneself’ that they mean. You are well aware of\nwhat that means. Every man has felt himself to be the equal of a\ngod at certain moments. At least, this is the way it is expressed. But\nthis comes from the fact that in a \u0000ash he felt the amazing grandeur\nof the human mind. The conquerors are merely those among men\nwho are conscious enough of their strength to be sure of living\nconstantly on those heights and fully aware of that grandeur. It is a\nquestion of arithmetic, of more or less. The conquerors are capable\nof the more. But they are capable of no more than man himself\nwhen he wants. This is why they never leave the human crucible,\nplunging into the seething soul of revolutions.\n“There they \u0000nd the creature mutilated, but they also encounter\nthere the only values they like and admire, man and his silence.\nThis is both their destitution and their wealth. There is but one\nluxury for them—that of human relations. How can one fail to\nrealize that in this vulnerable universe everything that is human and\nsolely human assumes a more vivid meaning? Taut faces, threatened\nfraternity, such strong and chaste friendship among men—these are\nthe true riches because they are transitory. In their midst the mind\nis most aware of its powers and limitations. That is to say, its\ne\u0000cacity. Some have spoken of genius. But genius is easy to say; I\nprefer the intelligence. It must be said that it can be magni\u0000cent\nthen. It lights up this desert and dominates it. It knows its\nobligations and illustrates them. It will die at the same time as this\nbody. But knowing this constitutes its freedom.\n* * *\n\f\n“We are not ignorant of the fact that all churches are against us. A\nheart so keyed up eludes the eternal, and all churches, divine or\npolitical, lay claim to the eternal. Happiness and courage,\nretribution or justice are secondary ends for them. It is a doctrine\nthey bring, and one must subscribe to it. But I have no concern with\nideas or with the eternal. The truths that come within my scope can\nbe touched with the hand. I cannot separate from them. This is why\nyou cannot base anything on me: nothing of the conqueror lasts, not\neven his doctrines.\n“At the end of all that, despite everything, is death. We know also\nthat it ends everything. This is why those cemeteries all over\nEurope, which obsess some among us, are hideous. People beautify\nonly what they love, and death repels us and tires our patience. It,\ntoo, is to be conquered. The last Carrara, a prisoner in Padua\nemptied by the plague and besieged by the Venetians, ran\nscreaming through the halls of his deserted palace: he was calling\non the devil and asking him for death. This was a way of\novercoming it. And it is likewise a mark of courage characteristic of\nthe Occident to have made so ugly the places where death thinks\nitself honored. In the rebel’s universe, death exalts injustice. It is the\nsupreme abuse.\n“Others, without compromising either, have chosen the eternal\nand denounced the illusion of this world. Their cemeteries smile\namid numerous \u0000owers and birds. That suits the conqueror and\ngives him a clear image of what he has rejected. He has chosen, on\nthe contrary, the black iron fence or the potter’s \u0000eld. The best\namong the men of God occasionally are seized with fright mingled\nwith consideration and pity for minds that can live with such an\nimage of their death. Yet those minds derive their strength and\njusti\u0000cation from this. Our fate stands before us and we provoke\nhim. Less out of pride than out of awareness of our ine\u0000ectual\ncondition. We, too, sometimes feel pity for ourselves. It is the only\ncompassion that seems acceptable to us: a feeling that perhaps you\nhardly understand and that seems to you scarcely virile. Yet the\nmost daring among us are the ones who feel it. But we call the lucid"

    "raw_text": "ones virile and we do not want a strength that is apart from\nlucidity.”\n* * *\nLet me repeat that these images do not propose moral codes and\ninvolve no judgments: they are sketches. They merely represent a\nstyle of life. The lover, the actor, or the adventurer plays the\nabsurd. But equally well, if he wishes, the chaste man, the civil\nservant, or the president of the Republic. It is enough to know and\nto mask nothing. In Italian museums are sometimes found little\npainted screens that the priest used to hold in front of the face of\ncondemned men to hide the sca\u0000old from them. The leap in all its\nforms, rushing into the divine or the eternal, surrendering to the\nillusions of the everyday or of the idea—all these screens hide the\nabsurd. But there are civil servants without screens, and they are\nthe ones of whom I mean to speak.\nI have chosen the most extreme ones. At this level the absurd\ngives them a royal power. It is true that those princes are without a\nkingdom. But they have this advantage over others: they know that\nall royalties are illusory. They know that is their whole nobility,\nand it is useless to speak in relation to them of hidden misfortune or\nthe ashes of disillusion. Being deprived of hope is not despairing.\nThe \u0000ames of earth are surely worth celestial perfumes. Neither I\nnor anyone can judge them here. They are not striving to be better;\nthey are attempting to be consistent. If the term “wise man” can be\napplied to the man who lives on what he has without speculating on\nwhat he has not, then they are wise men. One of them, a conqueror\nbut in the realm of mind, a Don Juan but of knowledge, an actor\nbut of the intelligence, knows this better than anyone: “You nowise\ndeserve a privilege on earth and in heaven for having brought to\nperfection your dear little meek sheep; you nonetheless continue to\nbe at best a ridiculous dear little sheep with horns and nothing more\n—even supposing that you do not burst with vanity and do not\ncreate a scandal by posing as a judge.”\n\f\nIn any case, it was essential to restore to the absurd reasoning\nmore cordial examples. The imagination can add many others,\ninseparable from time and exile, who likewise know how to live in\nharmony with a universe without future and without weakness. This\nabsurd, godless world is, then, peopled with men who think clearly\nand have ceased to hope. And I have not yet spoken of the most\nabsurd character, who is the creator.\n1 In the fullest sense and with his faults. A healthy attitude also includes faults.\n2 At this point I am thinking of Molière’s Alceste. Everything is so simple, so obvious and so\ncoarse. Alceste against Philinte, Célimène against Elianthe, the whole subject in the absurd\nconsequence of a nature carried to its extreme, and the verse itself, the “bad verse,” barely\naccented like the monotony of the character’s nature."

    "raw_text": "A\nABSURD CREATION\nPhilosophy and Fiction\nLL THOSE lives maintained in the rare\u0000ed air of the absurd\ncould not persevere without some profound and constant\nthought to infuse its strength into them. Right here, it can be only a\nstrange feeling of \u0000delity. Conscious men have been seen to ful\u0000ll\ntheir task amid the most stupid of wars without considering\nthemselves in contradiction. This is because it was essential to elude\nnothing. There is thus a metaphysical honor in enduring the world’s\nabsurdity. Conquest or play-acting, multiple loves, absurd revolt are\ntributes that man pays to his dignity in a campaign in which he is\ndefeated in advance.\nIt is merely a matter of being faithful to the rule of the battle.\nThat thought may su\u0000ce to sustain a mind; it has supported and\nstill supports whole civilizations. War cannot be negated. One must\nlive it or die of it. So it is with the absurd: it is a question of\nbreathing with it, of recognizing its lessons and recovering their\n\u0000esh. In this regard the absurd joy par excellence is creation. “Art\nand nothing but art,” said Nietzsche; “we have art in order not to\ndie of the truth.”\nIn the experience that I am attempting to describe and to stress\non several modes, it is certain that a new torment arises wherever\nanother dies. The childish chasing after forgetfulness, the appeal of\nsatisfaction are now devoid of echo. But the constant tension that\nkeeps man face to face with the world, the ordered delirium that\nurges him to be receptive to everything leave him another fever. In\nthis universe the work of art is then the sole chance of keeping his\nconsciousness and of \u0000xing its adventures. Creating is living doubly.\nThe groping, anxious quest of a Proust, his meticulous collecting of\n\u0000owers, of wallpapers, and of anxieties, signi\u0000es nothing else. At\n\f\nthe same time, it has no more signi\u0000cance than the continual and\nimperceptible creation in which the actor, the conqueror, and all\nabsurd men indulge every day of their lives. All try their hands at\nmiming, at repeating, and at re-creating the reality that is theirs.\nWe always end up by having the appearance of our truths. All\nexistence for a man turned away from the eternal is but a vast mime\nunder the mask of the absurd. Creation is the great mime.\nSuch men know to begin with, and then their whole e\u0000ort is to\nexamine, to enlarge, and to enrich the ephemeral island on which\nthey have just landed. But \u0000rst they must know. For the absurd\ndiscovery coincides with a pause in which future passions are\nprepared and justi\u0000ed. Even men without a gospel have their Mount\nof Olives. And one must not fall asleep on theirs either. For the\nabsurd man it is not a matter of explaining and solving, but of\nexperiencing and describing. Everything begins with lucid\nindi\u0000erence.\nDescribing—that is the last ambition of an absurd thought.\nScience likewise, having reached the end of its paradoxes, ceases to\npropound and stops to contemplate and sketch the ever virgin\nlandscape of phenomena. The heart learns thus that the emotion\ndelighting us when we see the world’s aspects comes to us not from\nits depth but from their diversity. Explanation is useless, but the\nsensation remains and, with it, the constant attractions of a universe\ninexhaustible in quantity. The place of the work of art can be\nunderstood at this point.\nIt marks both the death of an experience and its multiplication. It\nis a sort of monotonous and passionate repetition of the themes\nalready orchestrated by the world: the body, inexhaustible image on\nthe pediment of temples, forms or colors, number or grief. It is\ntherefore not indi\u0000erent, as a conclusion, to encounter once again\nthe principal themes of this essay in the wonderful and childish\nworld of the creator. It would be wrong to see a symbol in it and to\nthink that the work of art can be considered at last as a refuge for\nthe absurd. It is itself an absurd phenomenon, and we are concerned\nmerely with its description. It does not o\u0000er an escape for the\nintellectual ailment. Rather, it is one of the symptoms of that\n\f\nailment which re\u0000ects it throughout a man’s whole thought. But for\nthe \u0000rst time it makes the mind get outside of itself and places it in\nopposition to others, not for it to get lost but to show it clearly the\nblind path that all have entered upon. In the time of the absurd\nreasoning, creation follows indi\u0000erence and discovery. It marks the\npoint from which absurd passions spring and where the reasoning\nstops. Its place in this essay is justi\u0000ed in this way.\nIt will su\u0000ce to bring to light a few themes common to the\ncreator and the thinker in order to \u0000nd in the work of art all the\ncontradictions of thought involved in the absurd. Indeed, it is not so\nmuch identical conclusions that prove minds to be related as the\ncontradictions that are common to them. So it is with thought and\ncreation. I hardly need to say that the same anguish urges man to\nthese two attitudes. This is where they coincide in the beginning.\nBut among all the thoughts that start from the absurd, I have seen\nthat very few remain within it. And through their deviations or\nin\u0000delities I have best been able to measure what belonged to the\nabsurd. Similarly I must wonder: is an absurd work of art possible?\n* * *\nIt would be impossible to insist too much on the arbitrary nature\nof the former opposition between art and philosophy. If you insist\non taking it in too limited a sense, it is certainly false. If you mean\nmerely that these two disciplines each have their peculiar climate,\nthat is probably true but remains vague. The only acceptable\nargument used to lie in the contradiction brought up between the\nphilosopher enclosed within his system and the artist placed before\nhis work. But this was pertinent for a certain form of art and of\nphilosophy which we consider secondary here. The idea of an art\ndetached from its creator is not only outmoded; it is false. In\nopposition to the artist, it is pointed out that no philosopher ever\ncreated several systems. But that is true in so far, indeed, as no\nartist ever expressed more than one thing under di\u0000erent aspects.\nThe instantaneous perfection of art, the necessity for its renewal—\nthis is true only through a preconceived notion. For the work of art\n\f\nlikewise is a construction and everyone knows how monotonous the\ngreat creators can be. For the same reason as the thinker, the artist\ncommits himself and becomes himself in his work. That osmosis\nraises the most important of æsthetic problems. Moreover, to\nanyone who is convinced of the mind’s singleness of purpose,\nnothing is more futile than these distinctions based on methods and\nobjects. There are no frontiers between the disciplines that man sets\nhimself for understanding and loving. They interlock, and the same\nanxiety merges them.\nIt is necessary to state this to begin with. For an absurd work of\nart to be possible, thought in its most lucid form must be involved\nin it. But at the same time thought must not be apparent except as\nthe regulating intelligence. This paradox can be explained according\nto the absurd. The work of art is born of the intelligence’s refusal to\nreason the concrete. It marks the triumph of the carnal. It is lucid\nthought that provokes it, but in that very act that thought\nrepudiates itself. It will not yield to the temptation of adding to\nwhat is described a deeper meaning that it knows to be illegitimate.\nThe work of art embodies a drama of the intelligence, but it proves\nthis only indirectly. The absurd work requires an artist conscious of\nthese limitations and an art in which the concrete signi\u0000es nothing\nmore than itself. It cannot be the end, the meaning, and the\nconsolation of a life. Creating or not creating changes nothing. The\nabsurd creator does not prize his work. He could repudiate it. He\ndoes sometimes repudiate it. An Abyssinia su\u0000ces for this, as in the\ncase of Rimbaud.\nAt the same time a rule of æsthetics can be seen in this. The true\nwork of art is always on the human scale. It is essentially the one\nthat says “less.” There is a certain relationship between the global\nexperience of the artist and the work that re\u0000ects that experience,\nbetween Wilhelm Meister and Goethe’s maturity. That relationship is\nbad when the work aims to give the whole experience in the lace-\npaper of an explanatory literature. That relationship is good when\nthe work is but a piece cut out of experience, a facet of the diamond\nin which the inner luster is epitomized without being limited. In the\n\u0000rst case there is overloading and pretension to the eternal. In the\n\f\nsecond, a fecund work because of a whole implied experience, the\nwealth of which is suspected. The problem for the absurd artist is to\nacquire this savoir-vivre which transcends savoir-faire. And in the end,\nthe great artist under this climate is, above all, a great living being,\nit being understood that living in this case is just as much\nexperiencing as re\u0000ecting. The work then embodies an intellectual\ndrama. The absurd work illustrates thought’s renouncing of its\nprestige and its resignation to being no more than the intelligence\nthat works up appearances and covers with images what has no\nreason. If the world were clear, art would not exist.\nI am not speaking here of the arts of form or color in which\ndescription alone prevails in its splendid modesty.1 Expression\nbegins where thought ends. Those adolescents with empty\neyesockets who people temples and museums—their philosophy has\nbeen expressed in gestures. For an absurd man it is more educative\nthan all libraries. Under another aspect the same is true for music. If\nany art is devoid of lessons, it is certainly music. It is too closely\nrelated to mathematics not to have borrowed their gratuitousness.\nThat game the mind plays with itself according to set and measured\nlaws takes place in the sonorous compass that belongs to us and\nbeyond which the vibrations nevertheless meet in an inhuman\nuniverse. There is no purer sensation. These examples are too easy.\nThe absurd man recognizes as his own these harmonies and these\nforms.\nBut I should like to speak here of a work in which the temptation\nto explain remains greatest, in which illusion o\u0000ers itself\nautomatically, in which conclusion is almost inevitable. I mean\n\u0000ctional creation. I propose to inquire whether or not the absurd\ncan hold its own there.\n* * *\nTo think is \u0000rst of all to create a world (or to limit one’s own\nworld, which comes to the same thing). It is starting out from the\nbasic disagreement that separates man from his experience in order\nto \u0000nd a common ground according to one’s nostalgia, a universe\n\f\nhedged with reasons or lighted up with analogies but which, in any\ncase, gives an opportunity to rescind the unbearable divorce. The\nphilosopher, even if he is Kant, is a creator. He has his characters,\nhis symbols, and his secret action. He has his plot endings. On the\ncontrary, the lead taken by the novel over poetry and the essay\nmerely represents, despite appearances, a greater intellectualization\nof the art. Let there be no mistake about it; I am speaking of the\ngreatest. The fecundity and the importance of a literary form are\noften measured by the trash it contains. The number of bad novels\nmust not make us forget the value of the best. These, indeed, carry\nwith them their universe. The novel has its logic, its reasonings, its\nintuition, and its postulates. It also has its requirements of clarity.2\nThe classical opposition of which I was speaking above is even\nless justi\u0000ed in this particular case. It held in the time when it was\neasy to separate philosophy from its authors. Today when thought\nhas ceased to lay claim to the universal, when its best history would\nbe that of its repentances, we know that the system, when it is\nworth while, cannot be separated from its author. The Ethics itself,\nin one of its aspects, is but a long and reasoned personal confession.\nAbstract thought at last returns to its prop of \u0000esh. And, likewise,\nthe \u0000ctional activities of the body and of the passions are regulated\na little more according to the requirements of a vision of the world.\nThe writer has given up telling “stories” and creates his universe.\nThe great novelists are philosophical novelists—that is, the contrary\nof thesis-writers. For instance, Balzac, Sade, Melville, Stendhal,\nDostoevsky, Proust, Malraux, Kafka, to cite but a few.\nBut in fact the preference they have shown for writing in images\nrather than in reasoned arguments is revelatory of a certain thought\nthat is common to them all, convinced of the uselessness of any\nprinciple of explanation and sure of the educative message of\nperceptible appearance. They consider the work of art both as an\nend and a beginning. It is the outcome of an often unexpressed\nphilosophy, its illustration and its consummation. But it is complete\nonly through the implications of that philosophy. It justi\u0000es at last\nthat variant of an old theme that a little thought estranges from life\nwhereas much thought reconciles to life. Incapable of re\u0000ning the\n\f\nreal, thought pauses to mimic it. The novel in question is the\ninstrument of that simultaneously relative and inexhaustible\nknowledge, so like that of love. Of love, \u0000ctional creation has the\ninitial wonder and the fecund rumination.\n* * *\nThese at least are the charms I see in it at the outset. But I saw\nthem likewise in those princes of humiliated thought whose suicides\nI was later able to witness. What interests me, indeed, is knowing\nand describing the force that leads them back toward the common\npath of illusion. The same method will consequently help me here.\nThe fact of having already utilized it will allow me to shorten my\nargument and to sum it up without delay in a particular example. I\nwant to know whether, accepting a life without appeal, one can also\nagree to work and create without appeal and what is the way leading\nto these liberties. I want to liberate my universe of its phantoms\nand to people it solely with \u0000esh-and-blood truths whose presence I\ncannot deny. I can perform absurd work, choose the creative\nattitude rather than another. But an absurd attitude, if it is to\nremain so, must remain aware of its gratuitousness. So it is with the\nwork of art. If the commandments of the absurd are not respected,\nif the work does not illustrate divorce and revolt, if it sacri\u0000ces to\nillusions and arouses hope, it ceases to be gratuitous. I can no\nlonger detach myself from it. My life may \u0000nd a meaning in it, but\nthat is tri\u0000ing. It ceases to be that exercise in detachment and\npassion which crowns the splendor and futility of a man’s life.\nIn the creation in which the temptation to explain is the strongest,\ncan one overcome that temptation? In the \u0000ctional world in which\nawareness of the real world is keenest, can I remain faithful to the\nabsurd without sacri\u0000cing to the desire to judge? So many questions\nto be taken into consideration in a last e\u0000ort. It must be already\nclear what they signify. They are the last scruples of an awareness\nthat fears to forsake its initial and di\u0000cult lesson in favor of a \u0000nal\nillusion. What holds for creation, looked upon as one of the possible\nattitudes for the man conscious of the absurd, holds for all the styles\n\f\nof life open to him. The conqueror or the actor, the creator or Don\nJuan may forget that their exercise in living could not do without\nawareness of its mad character. One becomes accustomed so\nquickly. A man wants to earn money in order to be happy, and his\nwhole e\u0000ort and the best of a life are devoted to the earning of that\nmoney. Happiness is forgotten; the means are taken for the end.\nLikewise, the whole e\u0000ort of this conqueror will be diverted to\nambition, which was but a way toward a greater life. Don Juan in\nturn will likewise yield to his fate, be satis\u0000ed with that existence\nwhose nobility is of value only through revolt. For one it is\nawareness and for the other, revolt; in both cases the absurd has\ndisappeared. There is so much stubborn hope in the human heart.\nThe most destitute men often end up by accepting illusion. That\napproval prompted by the need for peace inwardly parallels the\nexistential consent. There are thus gods of light and idols of mud.\nBut it is essential to \u0000nd the middle path leading to the faces of\nman.\nSo far, the failures of the absurd exigence have best informed us\nas to what it is. In the same way, if we are to be informed, it will\nsu\u0000ce to notice that \u0000ctional creation can present the same\nambiguity as certain philosophies. Hence I can choose as illustration\na work comprising everything that denotes awareness of the absurd,\nhaving a clear starting-point and a lucid climate. Its consequences\nwill enlighten us. If the absurd is not respected in it, we shall know\nby what expedient illusion enters in. A particular example, a theme,\na creator’s \u0000delity will su\u0000ce, then. This involves the same analysis\nthat has already been made at greater length.\nI shall examine a favorite theme of Dostoevsky. I might just as\nwell have studied other works.3 But in this work the problem is\ntreated directly, in the sense of nobility and emotion, as for the\nexistential philosophies already discussed. This parallelism serves\nmy purpose.\nKirilov\n\f\nAll of Dostoevsky’s heroes question themselves as to the meaning\nof life. In this they are modern: they do not fear ridicule. What\ndistinguishes modern sensibility from classical sensibility is that the\nlatter thrives on moral problems and the former on metaphysical\nproblems. In Dostoevsky’s novels the question is propounded with\nsuch intensity that it can only invite extreme solutions. Existence is\nillusory or it is eternal. If Dostoevsky were satis\u0000ed with this\ninquiry, he would be a philosopher. But he illustrates the\nconsequences that such intellectual pastimes may have in a man’s\nlife, and in this regard he is an artist. Among those consequences,\nhis attention is arrested particularly by the last one, which he\nhimself calls logical suicide in his Diary of a Writer. In the\ninstallments for December 1876, indeed, he imagines the reasoning\nof “logical suicide.” Convinced that human existence is an utter\nabsurdity for anyone without faith in immortality, the desperate\nman comes to the following conclusions:\n“Since in reply to my questions about happiness, I am told,\nthrough the intermediary of my consciousness, that I cannot be\nhappy except in harmony with the great all, which I cannot\nconceive and shall never be in a position to conceive, it is\nevident …”\n“Since, \u0000nally, in this connection, I assume both the role of the\nplainti\u0000 and that of the defendant, of the accused and of the judge,\nand since I consider this comedy perpetrated by nature altogether\nstupid, and since I even deem it humiliating for me to deign to play\nit …”\n“In my indisputable capacity of plainti\u0000 and defendant, of judge\nand accused, I condemn that nature which, with such impudent\nnerve, brought me into being in order to su\u0000er— I condemn it to be\nannihilated with me.”\nThere remains a little humor in that position. This suicide kills\nhimself because, on the metaphysical plane, he is vexed. In a certain\nsense he is taking his revenge. This is his way of proving that he\n“will not be had.” It is known, however, that the same theme is\nembodied, but with the most wonderful generality, in Kirilov of The\nPossessed, likewise an advocate of logical suicide. Kirilov the\n\f\nengineer declares somewhere that he wants to take his own life\nbecause it “is his idea.” Obviously the word must be taken in its\nproper sense. It is for an idea, a thought, that he is getting ready for\ndeath. This is the superior suicide. Progressively, in a series of\nscenes in which Kirilov’s mask is gradually illuminated, the fatal\nthought driving him is revealed to us. The engineer, in fact, goes\nback to the arguments of the Diary. He feels that God is necessary\nand that he must exist. But he knows that he does not and cannot\nexist. “Why do you not realize,” he exclaims, “that this is su\u0000cient\nreason for killing oneself?” That attitude involves likewise for him\nsome of the absurd consequences. Through indi\u0000erence he accepts\nletting his suicide be used to the advantage of a cause he despises.\n“I decided last night that I didn’t care.” And \u0000nally he prepares his\ndeed with a mixed feeling of revolt and freedom. “I shall kill myself\nin order to assert my insubordination, my new and dreadful\nliberty.” It is no longer a question of revenge, but of revolt. Kirilov\nis consequently an absurd character—yet with this essential\nreservation: he kills himself. But he himself explains this\ncontradiction, and in such a way that at the same time he reveals\nthe absurd secret in all its purity. In truth, he adds to his fatal logic\nan extraordinary ambition which gives the character its full\nperspective: he wants to kill himself to become god.\nThe reasoning is classic in its clarity. If God does not exist, Kirilov\nis god. If God does not exist, Kirilov must kill himself. Kirilov must\ntherefore kill himself to become god. That logic is absurd, but it is\nwhat is needed. The interesting thing, however, is to give a\nmeaning to that divinity brought to earth. That amounts to\nclarifying the premise: “If God does not exist, I am god,” which still\nremains rather obscure. It is important to note at the outset that the\nman who \u0000aunts that mad claim is indeed of this world. He\nperforms his gymnastics every morning to preserve his health. He is\nstirred by the joy of Chatov recovering his wife. On a sheet of paper\nto be found after his death he wants to draw a face sticking out his\ntongue at “them.” He is childish and irascible, passionate,\nmethodical, and sensitive. Of the superman he has nothing but the\nlogic and the obsession, whereas of man he has the whole\n\f\ncatalogue. Yet it is he who speaks calmly of his divinity. He is not\nmad, or else Dostoevsky is. Consequently it is not a megalomaniac’s\nillusion that excites him. And taking the words in their speci\u0000c\nsense would, in this instance, be ridiculous.\nKirilov himself helps us to understand. In reply to a question from\nStavrogin, he makes clear that he is not talking of a god-man. It\nmight be thought that this springs from concern to distinguish\nhimself from Christ. But in reality it is a matter of annexing Christ.\nKirilov in fact fancies for a moment that Jesus at his death did not\n\u0000nd himself in Paradise. He found out then that his torture had been\nuseless. “The laws of nature,” says the engineer, “made Christ live\nin the midst of falsehood and die for a falsehood.” Solely in this\nsense Jesus indeed personi\u0000es the whole human drama. He is the\ncomplete man, being the one who realized the most absurd\ncondition. He is not the God-man but the man-god. And, like him,\neach of us can be cruci\u0000ed and victimized—and is to a certain\ndegree.\nThe divinity in question is therefore altogether terrestrial. “For\nthree years,” says Kirilov, “I sought the attribute of my divinity and\nI have found it. The attribute of my divinity is independence.” Now\ncan be seen the meaning of Kirilov’s premise: “If God does not exist,\nI am god.” To become god is merely to be free on this earth, not to\nserve an immortal being. Above all, of course, it is drawing all the\ninferences from that painful independence. If God exists, all depends\non him and we can do nothing against his will. If he does not exist,\neverything depends on us. For Kirilov, as for Nietzsche, to kill God\nis to become god oneself; it is to realize on this earth the eternal life\nof which the Gospel speaks.4\nBut if this metaphysical crime is enough for man’s ful\u0000llment,\nwhy add suicide? Why kill oneself and leave this world after having\nwon freedom? That is contradictory. Kirilov is well aware of this,\nfor he adds: “If you feel that, you are a tsar and, far from killing\nyourself, you will live covered with glory.” But men in general do\nnot know it. They do not feel “that.” As in the time of Prometheus,\nthey entertain blind hopes.5 They need to be shown the way and\ncannot do without preaching. Consequently, Kirilov must kill\n\f\nhimself out of love for humanity. He must show his brothers a royal\nand di\u0000cult path on which he will be the \u0000rst. It is a pedagogical\nsuicide. Kirilov sacri\u0000ces himself, then. But if he is cruci\u0000ed, he will\nnot be victimized. He remains the man-god, convinced of a death\nwithout future, imbued with evangelical melancholy. “I,” he says,\n“am unhappy because I am obliged to assert my freedom.” But once\nhe is dead and men are at last enlightened, this earth will be\npeopled with tsars and lighted up with human glory. Kirilov’s pistol\nshot will be the signal for the last revolution. Thus, it is not despair\nthat urges him to death, but love of his neighbor for his own sake.\nBefore terminating in blood an indescribable spiritual adventure,\nKirilov makes a remark as old as human su\u0000ering: “All is well.”\nThis theme of suicide in Dostoevsky, then, is indeed an absurd\ntheme. Let us merely note before going on that Kirilov reappears in\nother characters who themselves set in motion additional absurd\nthemes. Stavrogin and Ivan Karamazov try out the absurd truths in\npractical life. They are the ones liberated by Kirilov’s death. They\ntry their skill at being tsars. Stavrogin leads an “ironic” life, and it is\nwell known in what regard. He arouses hatred around him. And yet\nthe key to the character is found in his farewell letter: “I have not\nbeen able to detest anything.” He is a tsar in indi\u0000erence. Ivan is\nlikewise by refusing to surrender the royal powers of the mind. To\nthose who, like his brother, prove by their lives that it is essential\nto humiliate oneself in order to believe, he might reply that the\ncondition is shameful. His key word is: “Everything is permitted,”\nwith the appropriate shade of melancholy. Of course, like Nietzsche,\nthe most famous of God’s assassins, he ends in madness. But this is a\nrisk worth running, and, faced with such tragic ends, the essential\nimpulse of the absurd mind is to ask: “What does that prove?”\n* * *\nThus the novels, like the Diary, propound the absurd question.\nThey establish logic unto death, exaltation, “dreadful” freedom, the\nglory of the tsars become human. All is well, everything is\npermitted, and nothing is hateful—these are absurd judgments. But\n\f\nwhat an amazing creation in which those creatures of \u0000re and ice\nseem so familiar to us. The passionate world of indi\u0000erence that\nrumbles in their hearts does not seem at all monstrous to us. We\nrecognize in it our everyday anxieties. And probably no one so\nmuch as Dostoevsky has managed to give the absurd world such\nfamiliar and tormenting charms.\nYet what is his conclusion? Two quotations will show the\ncomplete metaphysical reversal that leads the writer to other\nrevelations. The argument of the one who commits logical suicide\nhaving provoked protests from the critics, Dostoevsky in the\nfollowing installments of the Diary ampli\u0000es his position and\nconcludes thus: “If faith in immortality is so necessary to the human\nbeing (that without it he comes to the point of killing himself), it\nmust therefore be the normal state of humanity. Since this is the\ncase, the immortality of the human soul exists without any doubt.”\nThen again in the last pages of his last novel, at the conclusion of\nthat gigantic combat with God, some children ask Aliocha:\n“Karamazov, is it true what religion says, that we shall rise from the\ndead, that we shall see one another again?” And Aliocha answers:\n“Certainly, we shall see one another again, we shall joyfully tell one\nanother everything that has happened.”\nThus Kirilov, Stavrogin, and Ivan are defeated. The Brothers\nKaramazov replies to The Possessed. And it is indeed a conclusion.\nAliocha’s case is not ambiguous, as is that of Prince Muichkin. Ill,\nthe latter lives in a perpetual present, tinged with smiles and\nindi\u0000erence, and that blissful state might be the eternal life of\nwhich the Prince speaks. On the contrary, Aliocha clearly says: “We\nshall meet again.” There is no longer any question of suicide and of\nmadness. What is the use, for anyone who is sure of immortality\nand of its joys? Man exchanges his divinity for happiness. “We shall\njoyfully tell one another everything that has happened.” Thus again\nKirilov’s pistol rang out somewhere in Russia, but the world\ncontinued to cherish its blind hopes. Men did not understand “that.”\nConsequently, it is not an absurd novelist addressing us, but an\nexistential novelist. Here, too, the leap is touching and gives its\nnobility to the art that inspires it. It is a stirring acquiescence,"

    "raw_text": "riddled with doubts, uncertain and ardent. Speaking of The Brothers\nKaramazov, Dostoevsky wrote: “The chief question that will be\npursued throughout this book is the very one from which I have\nsu\u0000ered consciously or unconsciously all life long: the existence of\nGod.” It is hard to believe that a novel su\u0000ced to transform into\njoyful certainty the su\u0000ering of a lifetime. One commentator6\ncorrectly pointed out that Dostoevsky is on Ivan’s side and that the\na\u0000rmative chapters took three months of e\u0000ort whereas what he\ncalled “the blasphemies” were written in three weeks in a state of\nexcitement. There is not one of his characters who does not have\nthat thorn in the \u0000esh, who does not aggravate it or seek a remedy\nfor it in sensation or immortality.7 In any case, let us remain with\nthis doubt. Here is a work which, in a chiaroscuro more gripping\nthan the light of day, permits us to seize man’s struggle against his\nhopes. Having reached the end, the creator makes his choice against\nhis characters. That contradiction thus allows us to make a\ndistinction. It is not an absurd work that is involved here, but a\nwork that propounds the absurd problem.\nDostoevsky’s reply is humiliation, “shame” according to\nStavrogin. An absurd work, on the contrary, does not provide a\nreply; that is the whole di\u0000erence. Let us note this carefully in\nconclusion: what contradicts the absurd in that work is not its\nChristian character, but rather its announcing a future life. It is\npossible to be Christian and absurd. There are examples of\nChristians who do not believe in a future life. In regard to the work\nof art, it should therefore be possible to de\u0000ne one of the directions\nof the absurd analysis that could have been anticipated in the\npreceding pages. It leads to propounding “the absurdity of the\nGospel.” It throws light upon this idea, fertile in repercussions, that\nconvictions do not prevent incredulity. On the contrary, it is easy to\nsee that the author of The Possessed, familiar with these paths, in\nconclusion took a quite di\u0000erent way. The surprising reply of the\ncreator to his characters, of Dostoevsky to Kirilov, can indeed be\nsummed up thus: existence is illusory and it is eternal.\n\f\nEphemeral Creation\nAt this point I perceive, therefore, that hope cannot be eluded\nforever and that it can beset even those who wanted to be free of it.\nThis is the interest I \u0000nd in the works discussed up to this point. I\ncould, at least in the realm of creation, list some truly absurd\nworks.8 But everything must have a beginning. The object of this\nquest is a certain \u0000delity. The Church has been so harsh with\nheretics only because she deemed that there is no worse enemy than\na child who has gone astray. But the record of Gnostic e\u0000ronteries\nand the persistence of Manichean currents have contributed more to\nthe construction of orthodox dogma than all the prayers. With due\nallowance, the same is true of the absurd. One recognizes one’s\ncourse by discovering the paths that stray from it. At the very\nconclusion of the absurd reasoning, in one of the attitudes dictated\nby its logic, it is not a matter of indi\u0000erence to \u0000nd hope coming\nback in under one of its most touching guises. That shows the\ndi\u0000culty of the absurd ascesis. Above all, it shows the necessity of\nunfailing alertness and thus con\u0000rms the general plan of this essay.\nBut if it is still too early to list absurd works, at least a conclusion\ncan be reached as to the creative attitude, one of those which can\ncomplete absurd existence. Art can never be so well served as by a\nnegative thought. Its dark and humiliated proceedings are as\nnecessary to the understanding of a great work as black is to white.\nTo work and create “for nothing,” to sculpture in clay, to know that\none’s creation has no future, to see one’s work destroyed in a day\nwhile being aware that fundamentally this has no more importance\nthan building for centuries—this is the di\u0000cult wisdom that absurd\nthought sanctions. Performing these two tasks simultaneously,\nnegating on the one hand and magnifying on the other, is the way\nopen to the absurd creator. He must give the void its colors.\nThis leads to a special conception of the work of art. Too often\nthe work of a creator is looked upon as a series of isolated\ntestimonies. Thus, artist and man of letters are confused. A\nprofound thought is in a constant state of becoming; it adopts the\n\f\nexperience of a life and assumes its shape. Likewise, a man’s sole\ncreation is strengthened in its successive and multiple aspects: his\nworks. One after another, they complement one another, correct or\novertake one another, contradict one another too. If something\nbrings creation to an end, it is not the victorious and illusory cry of\nthe blinded artist: “I have said everything,” but the death of the\ncreator which closes his experience and the book of his genius.\nThat e\u0000ort, that superhuman consciousness are not necessarily\napparent to the reader. There is no mystery in human creation. Will\nperforms this miracle. But at least there is no true creation without\na secret. To be sure, a succession of works can be but a series of\napproximations of the same thought. But it is possible to conceive of\nanother type of creator proceeding by juxtaposition. Their works\nmay seem to be devoid of interrelations. To a certain degree, they\nare contradictory. But viewed all together, they resume their\nnatural grouping. From death, for instance, they derive their\nde\u0000nitive signi\u0000cance. They receive their most obvious light from\nthe very life of their author. At the moment of death, the succession\nof his works is but a collection of failures. But if those failures all\nhave the same resonance, the creator has managed to repeat the\nimage of his own condition, to make the air echo with the sterile\nsecret he possesses.\nThe e\u0000ort to dominate is considerable here. But human\nintelligence is up to much more. It will merely indicate clearly the\nvoluntary aspect of creation. Elsewhere I have brought out the fact\nthat human will had no other purpose than to maintain awareness.\nBut that could not do without discipline. Of all the schools of\npatience and lucidity, creation is the most e\u0000ective. It is also the\nstaggering evidence of man’s sole dignity: the dogged revolt against\nhis condition, perseverance in an e\u0000ort considered sterile. It calls\nfor a daily e\u0000ort, self-mastery, a precise estimate of the limits of\ntruth, measure, and strength. It constitutes an ascesis. All that “for\nnothing,” in order to repeat and mark time. But perhaps the great\nwork of art has less importance in itself than in the ordeal it\ndemands of a man and the opportunity it provides him of\n\f\novercoming his phantoms and approaching a little closer to his\nnaked reality.\n* * *\nLet there be no mistake in æsthetics. It is not patient inquiry, the\nunceasing, sterile illustration of a thesis that I am calling for here.\nQuite the contrary, if I have made myself clearly understood. The\nthesis-novel, the work that proves, the most hateful of all, is the one\nthat most often is inspired by a smug thought. You demonstrate the\ntruth you feel sure of possessing. But those are ideas one launches,\nand ideas are the contrary of thought. Those creators are\nphilosophers, ashamed of themselves. Those I am speaking of or\nwhom I imagine are, on the contrary, lucid thinkers. At a certain\npoint where thought turns back on itself, they raise up the images\nof their works like the obvious symbols of a limited, mortal, and\nrebellious thought.\nThey perhaps prove something. But those proofs are ones that the\nnovelists provide for themselves rather than for the world in\ngeneral. The essential is that the novelists should triumph in the\nconcrete and that this constitute their nobility. This wholly carnal\ntriumph has been prepared for them by a thought in which abstract\npowers have been humiliated. When they are completely so, at the\nsame time the \u0000esh makes the creation shine forth in all its absurd\nluster. After all, ironic philosophies produce passionate works.\nAny thought that abandons unity glori\u0000es diversity. And diversity\nis the home of art. The only thought to liberate the mind is that\nwhich leaves it alone, certain of its limits and of its impending end.\nNo doctrine tempts it. It awaits the ripening of the work and of life.\nDetached from it, the work will once more give a barely mu\u0000ed\nvoice to a soul forever freed from hope. Or it will give voice to\nnothing if the creator, tired of his activity, intends to turn away.\nThat is equivalent.\n* * *\n\f\nThus, I ask of absurd creation what I required from thought—\nrevolt, freedom, and diversity. Later on it will manifest its utter\nfutility. In that daily e\u0000ort in which intelligence and passion mingle\nand delight each other, the absurd man discovers a discipline that\nwill make up the greatest of his strengths. The required diligence,\nthe doggedness and lucidity thus resemble the conqueror’s attitude.\nTo create is likewise to give a shape to one’s fate. For all these\ncharacters, their work de\u0000nes them at least as much as it is de\u0000ned\nby them. The actor taught us this: there is no frontier between\nbeing and appearing.\nLet me repeat. None of all this has any real meaning. On the way\nto that liberty, there is still a progress to be made. The \u0000nal e\u0000ort\nfor these related minds, creator or conqueror, is to manage to free\nthemselves also from their undertakings: succeed in granting that\nthe very work, whether it be conquest, love, or creation, may well\nnot be; consummate thus the utter futility of any individual life.\nIndeed, that gives them more freedom in the realization of that\nwork, just as becoming aware of the absurdity of life authorized\nthem to plunge into it with every excess.\nAll that remains is a fate whose outcome alone is fatal. Outside of\nthat single fatality of death, everything, joy or happiness, is liberty.\nA world remains of which man is the sole master. What bound him\nwas the illusion of another world. The outcome of his thought,\nceasing to be renunciatory, \u0000owers in images. It frolics—in myths,\nto be sure, but myths with no other depth than that of human\nsu\u0000ering and, like it, inexhaustible. Not the divine fable that amuses\nand blinds, but the terrestrial face, gesture, and drama in which are\nsummed up a di\u0000cult wisdom and an ephemeral passion.\n1 It is curious to note that the most intellectual kind of painting, the one that tries to reduce\nreality to its essential elements, is ultimately but a visual delight. All it has kept of the world\nis its color. (This is apparent particularly in Léger.)\n2 If you stop to think of it, this explains the worst novels. Almost everybody considers\nhimself capable of thinking and, to a certain degree, whether right or wrong, really does\n\f\nthink. Very few, on the contrary, can fancy themselves poets or artists in words. But from\nthe moment when thought won out over style, the mob invaded the novel.\nThat is not such a great evil as is said. The best are led to make greater demands upon\nthemselves. As for those who succumb, they did not deserve to survive.\n3 Malraux’s work, for instance. But it would have been necessary to deal at the same time\nwith the social question which in fact cannot be avoided by absurd thought (even though\nthat thought may put forward several solutions, very di\u0000erent from one another). One\nmust, however, limit oneself.\n4 “Stavrogin: ‘Do you believe in eternal life in the other world?’ Kirilov: ‘No, but in eternal\nlife in this world.’ ”\n5 “Man simply invented God in order not to kill himself. That is the summary of universal\nhistory down to this moment.”\n6 Boris de Schloezer.\n7 Gide’s curious and penetrating remark: almost all Dostoevsky’s heroes are polygamous.\n8 Melville’s Moby Dick, for instance."

    "raw_text": "T\nTHE MYTH OF SISYPHUS\nHE GODS had condemned Sisyphus to ceaselessly rolling a rock\nto the top of a mountain, whence the stone would fall back\nof its own weight. They had thought with some reason that there is\nno more dreadful punishment than futile and hopeless labor.\nIf one believes Homer, Sisyphus was the wisest and most prudent\nof mortals. According to another tradition, however, he was\ndisposed to practice the profession of highwayman. I see no\ncontradiction in this. Opinions di\u0000er as to the reasons why he\nbecame the futile laborer of the underworld. To begin with, he is\naccused of a certain levity in regard to the gods. He stole their\nsecrets. Ægina, the daughter of Æsopus, was carried o\u0000 by Jupiter.\nThe father was shocked by that disappearance and complained to\nSisyphus. He, who knew of the abduction, o\u0000ered to tell about it on\ncondition that Æsopus would give water to the citadel of Corinth.\nTo the celestial thunderbolts he preferred the benediction of water.\nHe was punished for this in the underworld. Homer tells us also that\nSisyphus had put Death in chains, Pluto could not endure the sight\nof his deserted, silent empire. He dispatched the god of war, who\nliberated Death from the hands of her conqueror.\nIt is said also that Sisyphus, being near to death, rashly wanted to\ntest his wife’s love. He ordered her to cast his unburied body into\nthe middle of the public square. Sisyphus woke up in the\nunderworld. And there, annoyed by an obedience so contrary to\nhuman love, he obtained from Pluto permission to return to earth in\norder to chastise his wife. But when he had seen again the face of\nthis world, enjoyed water and sun, warm stones and the sea, he no\nlonger wanted to go back to the infernal darkness. Recalls, signs of\nanger, warnings were of no avail. Many years more he lived facing\nthe curve of the gulf, the sparkling sea, and the smiles of earth. A\ndecree of the gods was necessary. Mercury came and seized the\nimpudent man by the collar and, snatching him from his joys, led\n\f\nhim forcibly back to the underworld, where his rock was ready for\nhim.\nYou have already grasped that Sisyphus is the absurd hero. He is,\nas much through his passions as through his torture. His scorn of the\ngods, his hatred of death, and his passion for life won him that\nunspeakable penalty in which the whole being is exerted toward\naccomplishing nothing. This is the price that must be paid for the\npassions of this earth. Nothing is told us about Sisyphus in the\nunderworld. Myths are made for the imagination to breathe life into\nthem. As for this myth, one sees merely the whole e\u0000ort of a body\nstraining to raise the huge stone, to roll it and push it up a slope a\nhundred times over; one sees the face screwed up, the cheek tight\nagainst the stone, the shoulder bracing the claycovered mass, the\nfoot wedging it, the fresh start with arms outstretched, the wholly\nhuman security of two earth-clotted hands. At the very end of his\nlong e\u0000ort measured by skyless space and time without depth, the\npurpose is achieved. Then Sisyphus watches the stone rush down in\na few moments toward that lower world whence he will have to\npush it up again toward the summit. He goes back down to the\nplain.\nIt is during that return, that pause, that Sisyphus interests me. A\nface that toils so close to stones is already stone itself! I see that\nman going back down with a heavy yet measured step toward the\ntorment of which he will never know the end. That hour like a\nbreathing-space which returns as surely as his su\u0000ering, that is the\nhour of consciousness. At each of those moments when he leaves the\nheights and gradually sinks toward the lairs of the gods, he is\nsuperior to his fate. He is stronger than his rock.\nIf this myth is tragic, that is because its hero is conscious. Where\nwould his torture be, indeed, if at every step the hope of succeeding\nupheld him? The workman of today works every day in his life at\nthe same tasks, and this fate is no less absurd. But it is tragic only at\nthe rare moments when it becomes conscious. Sisyphus, proletarian\nof the gods, powerless and rebellious, knows the whole extent of his\nwretched condition: it is what he thinks of during his descent. The\n\f\nlucidity that was to constitute his torture at the same time crowns\nhis victory. There is no fate that cannot be surmounted by scorn.\n* * *\nIf the descent is thus sometimes performed in sorrow, it can also\ntake place in joy. This word is not too much. Again I fancy Sisyphus\nreturning toward his rock, and the sorrow was in the beginning.\nWhen the images of earth cling too tightly to memory, when the\ncall of happiness becomes too insistent, it happens that melancholy\nrises in man’s heart: this is the rock’s victory, this is the rock itself.\nThe boundless grief is too heavy to bear. These are our nights of\nGethsemane. But crushing truths perish from being acknowledged.\nThus, Œdipus at the outset obeys fate without knowing it. But from\nthe moment he knows, his tragedy begins. Yet at the same moment,\nblind and desperate, he realizes that the only bond linking him to\nthe world is the cool hand of a girl. Then a tremendous remark\nrings out: “Despite so many ordeals, my advanced age and the\nnobility of my soul make me conclude that all is well.” Sophocles’\nŒdipus, like Dostoevsky’s Kirilov, thus gives the recipe for the\nabsurd victory. Ancient wisdom con\u0000rms modern heroism.\nOne does not discover the absurd without being tempted to write\na manual of happiness. “What! by such narrow ways—?” There is\nbut one world, however. Happiness and the absurd are two sons of\nthe same earth. They are inseparable. It would be a mistake to say\nthat happiness necessarily springs from the absurd discovery. It\nhappens as well that the feeling of the absurd springs from\nhappiness. “I conclude that all is well,” says Œdipus, and that\nremark is sacred. It echoes in the wild and limited universe of man.\nIt teaches that all is not, has not been, exhausted. It drives out of\nthis world a god who had come into it with dissatisfaction and a\npreference for futile su\u0000erings. It makes of fate a human matter,\nwhich must be settled among men.\nAll Sisyphus’ silent joy is contained therein. His fate belongs to\nhim. His rock is his thing. Likewise, the absurd man, when he\ncontemplates his torment, silences all the idols. In the universe\n\f\nsuddenly restored to its silence, the myriad wondering little voices\nof the earth rise up. Unconscious, secret calls, invitations from all\nthe faces, they are the necessary reverse and price of victory. There\nis no sun without shadow, and it is essential to know the night. The\nabsurd man says yes and his e\u0000ort will henceforth be unceasing. If\nthere is a personal fate, there is no higher destiny, or at least there\nis but one which he concludes is inevitable and despicable. For the\nrest, he knows himself to be the master of his days. At that subtle\nmoment when man glances backward over his life, Sisyphus\nreturning toward his rock, in that slight pivoting he contemplates\nthat series of unrelated actions which becomes his fate, created by\nhim, combined under his memory’s eye and soon sealed by his\ndeath. Thus, convinced of the wholly human origin of all that is\nhuman, a blind man eager to see who knows that the night has no\nend, he is still on the go. The rock is still rolling.\nI leave Sisyphus at the foot of the mountain! One always \u0000nds\none’s burden again. But Sisyphus teaches the higher \u0000delity that\nnegates the gods and raises rocks. He too concludes that all is well.\nThis universe henceforth without a master seems to him neither\nsterile nor futile. Each atom of that stone, each mineral \u0000ake of that\nnight-\u0000lled mountain, in itself forms a world. The struggle itself\ntoward the heights is enough to \u0000ll a mans heart. One must imagine\nSisyphus happy."

    "raw_text": "T\nAPPENDIX:\nHope and the Absurd in the Work of Franz Kafka\nHE WHOLE ART of Kafka consists in forcing the reader to reread.\nHis endings, or his absence of endings, suggest explanations\nwhich, however, are not revealed in clear language but, before they\nseem justi\u0000ed, require that the story be reread from another point\nof view. Sometimes there is a double possibility of interpretation,\nwhence appears the necessity for two readings. This is what the\nauthor wanted. But it would be wrong to try to interpret everything\nin Kafka in detail. A symbol is always in general and, however\nprecise its translation, an artist can restore to it only its movement:\nthere is no word-for-word rendering. Moreover, nothing is harder to\nunderstand than a symbolic work. A symbol always transcends the\none who makes use of it and makes him say in reality more than he\nis aware of expressing. In this regard, the surest means of getting\nhold of it is not to provoke it, to begin the work without a\npreconceived attitude and not to look for its hidden currents. For\nKafka in particular it is fair to agree to his rules, to approach the\ndrama through its externals and the novel through its form.\nAt \u0000rst glance and for a casual reader, they are disturbing\nadventures that carry o\u0000 quaking and dogged characters into\npursuit of problems they never formulate. In The Trial, Joseph K. is\naccused. But he doesn’t know of what. He is doubtless eager to\ndefend himself, but he doesn’t know why. The lawyers \u0000nd his case\ndi\u0000cult. Meanwhile, he does not neglect to love, to eat, or to read\nhis paper. Then he is judged. But the courtroom is very dark. He\ndoesn’t understand much. He merely assumes that he is condemned,\nbut to what he barely wonders. At times he suspects just the same,\nand he continues living. Some time later two well-dressed and polite\ngentlemen come to get him and invite him to follow them. Most\n\f\ncourteously they lead him into a wretched suburb, put his head on a\nstone, and slit his throat. Before dying the condemned man says\nmerely: “Like a dog.”\nYou see that it is hard to speak of a symbol in a tale whose most\nobvious quality just happens to be naturalness. But naturalness is a\nhard category to understand. There are works in which the event\nseems natural to the reader. But there are others (rarer, to be sure)\nin which the character considers natural what happens to him. By an\nodd but obvious paradox, the more extraordinary the character’s\nadventures are, the more noticeable will be the naturalness of the\nstory: it is in proportion to the divergence we feel between the\nstrangeness of a man’s life and the simplicity with which that man\naccepts it. It seems that this naturalness is Kafka’s. And, precisely,\none is well aware what The Trial means. People have spoken of an\nimage of the human condition. To be sure. Yet it is both simpler and\nmore complex. I mean that the signi\u0000cance of the novel is more\nparticular and more personal to Kafka. To a certain degree, he is the\none who does the talking, even though it is me he confesses. He\nlives and he is condemned. He learns this on the \u0000rst pages of the\nnovel he is pursuing in this world, and if he tries to cope with this,\nhe nonetheless does so without surprise. He will never show\nsu\u0000cient astonishment at this lack of astonishment. It is by such\ncontradictions that the \u0000rst signs of the absurd work are recognized.\nThe mind projects into the concrete its spiritual tragedy. And it can\ndo so solely by means of a perpetual paradox which confers on\ncolors the power to express the void and on daily gestures the\nstrength to translate eternal ambitions.\nLikewise, The Castle is perhaps a theology in action, but it is \u0000rst\nof all the individual adventure of a soul in quest of its grace, of a\nman who asks of this world’s objects their royal secret and of\nwomen the signs of the god that sleeps in them. Metamorphosis, in\nturn, certainly represents the horrible imagery of an ethic of\nlucidity. But it is also the product of that incalculable amazement\nman feels at being conscious of the beast he becomes e\u0000ortlessly. In\n\f\nthis fundamental ambiguity lies Kafka’s secret. These perpetual\noscillations between the natural and the extraordinary, the\nindividual and the universal, the tragic and the everyday, the absurd\nand the logical, are found throughout his work and give it both its\nresonance and its meaning. These are the paradoxes that must be\nenumerated, the contradictions that must be strengthened, in order\nto understand the absurd work.\nA symbol, indeed, assumes two planes, two worlds of ideas and\nsensations, and a dictionary of correspondences between them. This\nlexicon is the hardest thing to draw up. But awaking to the two\nworlds brought face to face is tantamount to getting on the trail of\ntheir secret relationships. In Kafka these two worlds are that of\neveryday life on the one hand and, on the other, that of\nsupernatural anxiety.1 It seems that we are witnessing here an\ninterminable exploitation of Nietzsche’s remark: “Great problems\nare in the street.”\nThere is in the human condition (and this is a commonplace of all\nliteratures) a basic absurdity as well as an implacable nobility. The\ntwo coincide, as is natural. Both of them are represented, let me\nrepeat, in the ridiculous divorce separating our spiritual excesses\nand the ephemeral joys of the body. The absurd thing is that it\nshould be the soul of this body which it transcends so inordinately.\nWhoever would like to represent this absurdity must give it life in a\nseries of parallel contrasts. Thus it is that Kafka expresses tragedy\nby the everyday and the absurd by the logical.\nAn actor lends more force to a tragic character the more careful\nhe is not to exaggerate it. If he is moderate, the horror he inspires\nwill be immoderate. In this regard Greek tragedy is rich in lessons.\nIn a tragic work fate always makes itself felt better in the guise of\nlogic and naturalness. Œdipus’s fate is announced in advance. It is\ndecided supernaturally that he will commit the murder and the\nincest. The drama’s whole e\u0000ort is to show the logical system\nwhich, from deduction to deduction, will crown the hero’s\nmisfortune. Merely to announce to us that uncommon fate is\nscarcely horrible, because it is improbable. But if its necessity is\ndemonstrated to us in the framework of everyday life, society,\n\f\nstate, familiar emotion, then the horror is hallowed. In that revolt\nthat shakes man and makes him say: “That is not possible,” there is\nan element of desperate certainty that “that” can be.\nThis is the whole secret of Greek tragedy, or at least of one of its\naspects. For there is another which, by a reverse method, would\nhelp us to understand Kafka better. The human heart has a tiresome\ntendency to label as fate only what crushes it. But happiness\nlikewise, in its way, is without reason, since it is inevitable. Modern\nman, however, takes the credit for it himself, when he doesn’t fail\nto recognize it. Much could be said, on the contrary, about the\nprivileged fates of Greek tragedy and those favored in legend who,\nlike Ulysses, in the midst of the worst adventures are saved from\nthemselves. It was not so easy to return to Ithaca.\nWhat must be remembered in any case is that secret complicity\nthat joins the logical and the everyday to the tragic. This is why\nSamsa, the hero of Metamorphosis, is a traveling salesman. This is\nwhy the only thing that disturbs him in the strange adventure that\nmakes a vermin of him is that his boss will be angry at his absence.\nLegs and feelers grow out on him, his spine arches up, white spots\nappear on his belly and—I shall not say that this does not astonish\nhim, for the e\u0000ect would be spoiled—but it causes him a “slight\nannoyance.” The whole art of Kafka is in that distinction. In his\ncentral work, The Castle, the details of everyday life stand out, and\nyet in that strange novel in which nothing concludes and everything\nbegins over again, it is the essential adventure of a soul in quest of\nits grace that is represented. That translation of the problem into\naction, that coincidence of the general and the particular are\nrecognized likewise in the little arti\u0000ces that belong to every great\ncreator. In The Trial the hero might have been named Schmidt or\nFranz Kafka. But he is named Joseph K. He is not Kafka and yet he\nis Kafka. He is an average European. He is like everybody else. But\nhe is also the entity K. who is the x of this \u0000esh-and-blood equation.\nLikewise, if Kafka wants to express the absurd, he will make use\nof consistency. You know the story of the crazy man who was\n\u0000shing in a bathtub. A doctor with ideas as to psychiatric treatments\nasked him “if they were biting,” to which he received the harsh\n\f\nreply: “Of course not, you fool, since this is a bathtub.” That story\nbelongs to the baroque type. But in it can be grasped quite clearly\nto what a degree the absurd e\u0000ect is linked to an excess of logic.\nKafka’s world is in truth an indescribable universe in which man\nallows himself the tormenting luxury of \u0000shing in a bathtub,\nknowing that nothing will come of it.\nConsequently, I recognize here a work that is absurd in its\nprinciples. As for The Trial, for instance, I can indeed say that it is a\ncomplete success. Flesh wins out. Nothing is lacking, neither the\nunexpressed revolt (but it is what is writing), nor lucid and mute\ndespair (but it is what is creating), nor that amazing freedom of\nmanner which the characters of the novel exemplify until their\nultimate death.\n* * *\nYet this world is not so closed as it seems. Into this universe\ndevoid of progress, Kafka is going to introduce hope in a strange\nform. In this regard The Trial and The Castle do not follow the same\ndirection. They complement each other. The barely perceptible\nprogression from one to the other represents a tremendous conquest\nin the realm of evasion. The Trial propounds a problem which The\nCastle, to a certain degree, solves. The \u0000rst describes according to a\nquasi-scienti\u0000c method and without concluding. The second, to a\ncertain degree, explains. The Trial diagnoses, and The Castle\nimagines a treatment. But the remedy proposed here does not cure.\nIt merely brings the malady back into normal life. It helps to accept\nit. In a certain sense (let us think of Kierkegaard), it makes people\ncherish it. The Land Surveyor K. cannot imagine another anxiety\nthan the one that is tormenting him. The very people around him\nbecome attached to that void and that nameless pain, as if su\u0000ering\nassumed in this case a privileged aspect. “How I need you,” Frieda\nsays to K. “How forsaken I feel, since knowing you, when you are\nnot with me.” This subtle remedy that makes us love what crushes\nus and makes hope spring up in a world without issue, this sudden\n\f\n“leap” through which everything is changed, is the secret of the\nexistential revolution and of The Castle itself.\nFew works are more rigorous in their development than The\nCastle. K. is named Land Surveyor to the Castle and he arrives in the\nvillage. But from the village to the Castle it is impossible to\ncommunicate. For hundreds of pages K. persists in seeking his way,\nmakes every advance, uses trickery and expedients, never gets\nangry, and with disconcerting good will tries to assume the duties\nentrusted to him. Each chapter is a new frustration. And also a new\nbeginning. It is not logic, but consistent method. The scope of that\ninsistence constitutes the work’s tragic quality. When K. telephones\nto the Castle, he hears confused, mingled voices, vague laughs,\ndistant invitations. That is enough to feed his hope, like those few\nsigns appearing in summer skies or those evening anticipations\nwhich make up our reason for living. Here is found the secret of the\nmelancholy peculiar to Kafka. The same, in truth, that is found in\nProust’s work or in the landscape of Plotinus: a nostalgia for a lost\nparadise. “I become very sad,” says Olga, “when Barnabas tells me\nin the morning that he is going to the Castle: that probably futile\ntrip, that probably wasted day, that probably empty hope.”\n“Probably”—on this implication Kafka gambles his entire work. But\nnothing avails; the quest of the eternal here is meticulous. And\nthose inspired automata, Kafka’s characters, provide us with a\nprecise image of what we should be if we were deprived of our\ndistractions2 and utterly consigned to the humiliations of the divine.\nIn The Castle that surrender to the everyday becomes an ethic.\nThe great hope of K. is to get the Castle to adopt him. Unable to\nachieve this alone, his whole e\u0000ort is to deserve this favor by\nbecoming an inhabitant of the village, by losing the status of\nforeigner that everyone makes him feel. What he wants is an\noccupation, a home, the life of a healthy, normal man. He can’t\nstand his madness any longer. He wants to be reasonable. He wants\nto cast o\u0000 the peculiar curse that makes him a stranger to the\nvillage. The episode of Frieda is signi\u0000cant in this regard. If he\ntakes as his mistress this woman who has known one of the Castle’s\no\u0000cials, this is because of her past. He derives from her something\n\f\nthat transcends him—while being aware of what makes her forever\nunworthy of the Castle. This makes one think of Kierkegaard’s\nstrange love for Regina Olsen. In certain men, the \u0000re of eternity\nconsuming them is great enough for them to burn in it the very\nheart of those closest to them. The fatal mistake that consists in\ngiving to God what is not God’s is likewise the subject of this\nepisode of The Castle. But for Kafka it seems that this is not a\nmistake. It is a doctrine and a “leap.” There is nothing that is not\nGod’s.\nEven more signi\u0000cant is the fact that the Land Surveyor breaks\nwith Frieda in order to go toward the Barnabas sisters. For the\nBarnabas family is the only one in the village that is utterly\nforsaken by the Castle and by the village itself. Amalia, the elder\nsister, has rejected the shameful propositions made her by one of\nthe Castle’s o\u0000cials. The immoral curse that followed has forever\ncast her out from the love of God. Being incapable of losing one’s\nhonor for God amounts to making oneself unworthy of his grace.\nYou recognize a theme familiar to existential philosophy: truth\ncontrary to morality. At this point things are far-reaching. For the\npath pursued by Kafka’s hero from Frieda to the Barnabas sisters is\nthe very one that leads from trusting love to the dei\u0000cation of the\nabsurd. Here again Kafka’s thought runs parallel to Kierkegaard. It\nis not surprising that the “Barnabas story” is placed at the end of the\nbook. The Land Surveyor’s last attempt is to recapture God through\nwhat negates him, to recognize him, not according to our categories\nof goodness and beauty, but behind the empty and hideous aspects\nof his indi\u0000erence, of his injustice, and of his hatred. That stranger\nwho asks the Castle to adopt him is at the end of his voyage a little\nmore exiled because this time he is unfaithful to himself, forsaking\nmorality, logic, and intellectual truths in order to try to enter,\nendowed solely with his mad hope, the desert of divine grace.3\n* * *\nThe word “hope” used here is not ridiculous. On the contrary, the\nmore tragic the condition described by Kafka, the \u0000rmer and more\n\f\naggressive that hope becomes. The more truly absurd The Trial is,\nthe more moving and illegitimate the impassioned “leap” of The\nCastle seems. But we \u0000nd here again in a pure state the paradox of\nexistential thought as it is expressed, for instance, by Kierkegaard:\n“Earthly hope must be killed; only then can one be saved by true\nhope,”4 which can be translated: “One has to have written The Trial\nto undertake The Castle.”\nMost of those who have spoken of Kafka have indeed de\u0000ned his\nwork as a desperate cry with no recourse left to man. But this calls\nfor review. There is hope and hope. To me the optimistic work of\nHenri Bordeaux seems peculiarly discouraging. This is because it has\nnothing for the discriminating. Malraux’s thought, on the other\nhand, is always bracing. But in these two cases neither the same\nhope nor the same despair is at issue. I see merely that the absurd\nwork itself may lead to the in\u0000delity I want to avoid. The work\nwhich was but an ine\u0000ectual repetition of a sterile condition, a lucid\nglori\u0000cation of the ephemeral, becomes here a cradle of illusions. It\nexplains, it gives a shape to hope. The creator can no longer divorce\nhimself from it. It is not the tragic game it was to be. It gives a\nmeaning to the author’s life.\nIt is strange in any case that works of related inspiration like\nthose of Kafka, Kierkegaard, or Chestov—those, in short, of\nexistential novelists and philosophers completely oriented toward\nthe Absurd and its consequences—should in the long run lead to that\ntremendous cry of hope.\nThey embrace the God that consumes them. It is through humility\nthat hope enters in. For the absurd of this existence assures them a\nlittle more of supernatural reality. If the course of this life leads to\nGod, there is an outcome after all. And the perseverance, the\ninsistence with which Kierkegaard, Chestov, and Kafka’s heroes\nrepeat their itineraries are a special warrant of the uplifting power\nof that certainty.5\nKafka refuses his god moral nobility, evidence, virtue, coherence,\nbut only the better to fall into his arms. The absurd is recognized,\naccepted, and man is resigned to it, but from then on we know that\nit has ceased to be the absurd. Within the limits of the human"

    "raw_text": "condition, what greater hope than the hope that allows an escape\nfrom that condition? As I see once more, existential thought in this\nregard (and contrary to current opinion) is steeped in a vast hope.\nThe very hope which at the time of early Christianity and the\nspreading of the good news in\u0000amed the ancient world. But in that\nleap that characterizes all existential thought, in that insistence, in\nthat surveying of a divinity devoid of surface, how can one fail to\nsee the mark of a lucidity that repudiates itself? It is merely claimed\nthat this is pride abdicating to save itself. Such a repudiation would\nbe fecund. But this does not change that. The moral value of lucidity\ncannot be diminished in my eyes by calling it sterile like all pride.\nFor a truth also, by its very de\u0000nition, is sterile. All facts are. In a\nworld where everything is given and nothing is explained, the\nfecundity of a value or of a metaphysic is a notion devoid of\nmeaning.\nIn any case, you see here in what tradition of thought Kafka’s\nwork takes its place. It would indeed be intelligent to consider as\ninevitable the progression leading from The Trial to The Castle.\nJoseph K. and the Land Surveyor K. are merely two poles that\nattract Kafka.6 I shall speak like him and say that his work is\nprobably not absurd. But that should not deter us from seeing its\nnobility and universality. They come from the fact that he managed\nto represent so fully the everyday passage from hope to grief and\nfrom desperate wisdom to intentional blindness. His work is\nuniversal (a really absurd work is not universal) to the extent to\nwhich it represents the emotionally moving face of man \u0000eeing\nhumanity, deriving from his contradictions reasons for believing,\nreasons for hoping from his fecund despairs, and calling life his\nterrifying apprenticeship in death. It is universal because its\ninspiration is religious. As in all religions, man is freed of the\nweight of his own life. But if I know that, if I can even admire it, I\nalso know that I am not seeking what is universal, but what is true.\nThe two may well not coincide.\nThis particular view will be better understood if I say that truly\nhopeless thought just happens to be de\u0000ned by the opposite criteria\nand that the tragic work might be the work that, after all future\n\f\nhope is exiled, describes the life of a happy man. The more exciting\nlife is, the more absurd is the idea of losing it. This is perhaps the\nsecret of that proud aridity felt in Nietzsche’s work. In this\nconnection, Nietzsche appears to be the only artist to have derived\nthe extreme consequences of an æsthetic of the Absurd, inasmuch as\nhis \u0000nal message lies in a sterile and conquering lucidity and an\nobstinate negation of any supernatural consolation.\nThe preceding should nevertheless su\u0000ce to bring out the capital\nimportance of Kafka in the framework of this essay. Here we are\ncarried to the con\u0000nes of human thought. In the fullest sense of the\nword, it can be said that everything in that work is essential. In any\ncase, it propounds the absurd problem altogether. If one wants to\ncompare these conclusions with our initial remarks, the content\nwith the form, the secret meaning of The Castle with the natural art\nin which it is molded, K.’s passionate, proud quest with the\neveryday setting against which it takes place, then one will realize\nwhat may be its greatness. For if nostalgia is the mark of the\nhuman, perhaps no one has given such \u0000esh and volume to these\nphantoms of regret. But at the same time will be sensed what\nexceptional nobility the absurd work calls for, which is perhaps not\nfound here. If the nature of art is to bind the general to the\nparticular, ephemeral eternity of a drop of water to the play of its\nlights, it is even truer to judge the greatness of the absurd writer by\nthe distance he is able to introduce between these two worlds. His\nsecret consists in being able to \u0000nd the exact point where they meet\nin their greatest disproportion.\nAnd, to tell the truth, this geometrical locus of man and the\ninhuman is seen everywhere by the pure in heart. If Faust and Don\nQuixote are eminent creations of art, this is because of the\nimmeasurable nobilities they point out to us with their earthly\nhands. Yet a moment always comes when the mind negates the\ntruths that those hands can touch. A moment comes when the\ncreation ceases to be taken tragically; it is merely taken seriously.\nThen man is concerned with hope. But that is not his business. His\nbusiness is to turn away from subterfuge. Yet this is just what I \u0000nd\nat the conclusion of the vehement proceedings Kafka institutes"

His unbelievable verdict is this hideous\nand upsetting world in which the very moles dare to hope.7\n1 It is worth noting that the works of Kafka can quite as legitimately be interpreted in the\nsense of a social criticism (for instance in The Trial). It is probable, moreover, that there is\nno need to choose. Both interpretations are good. In absurd terms, as we have seen, revolt\nagainst men is also directed against God: great revolutions are always metaphysical.\n2 In The Castle it seems that “distractions” in the Pascalian sense are represented by the\nassistants who “distract” K. from his anxiety. If Frieda eventually becomes the mistress of\none of the assistants, this is because she prefers the stage setting to truth, everyday life to\nshared anguish.\n3 This is obviously true only of the un\u0000nished version of The Castle that Kafka left us. But it\nis doubtful that the writer would have destroyed in the last chapters his novel’s unity of\ntone.\n4 Purity of heart.\n5 The only character without hope in The Castle is Amalia. She is the one with whom the\nLand Surveyor is most violently contrasted.\n6 On the two aspects of Kafka’s thought, compare “In the Penal Colony,” published by the\nCahiers du Sud (and in America by Partisan Review—translator’s note): “Guilt [‘of man’ is\nunderstood] is never doubtful” and a fragment of The Castle (Momus’s report): “The guilt of\nthe Land Surveyor K. is hard to establish.”\n7 What is o\u0000ered above is obviously an interpretation of Kafka’s work. But it is only fair to\nadd that nothing prevents its being considered, aside from any interpretation, from a purely\næsthetic point of view. For instance, B. Groethuysen in his remarkable preface to The Trial\nlimits himself, more wisely than we, to following merely the painful fancies of what he\ncalls, most strikingly, a daydreamer. It is the fate and perhaps the greatness of that work\nthat it o\u0000ers everything and con\u0000rms nothing.\n\f\nSUMMER IN ALGIERS\nfor\n                            JACQUES HEURGON"

    "raw_text": "T\n \nHE LOVES we share with a city are often secret loves. Old\nwalled towns like Paris, Prague, and even Florence are\nclosed in on themselves and hence limit the world that belongs to\nthem. But Algiers (together with certain other privileged places\nsuch as cities on the sea) opens to the sky like a mouth or a wound.\nIn Algiers one loves the commonplaces: the sea at the end of every\nstreet, a certain volume of sunlight, the beauty of the race. And, as\nalways, in that unashamed o\u0000ering there is a secret fragrance. In\nParis it is possible to be homesick for space and a beating of wings.\nHere at least man is grati\u0000ed in every wish and, sure of his desires,\ncan at last measure his possessions.\nProbably one has to live in Algiers for some time in order to\nrealize how paralyzing an excess of nature’s bounty can be. There is\nnothing here for whoever would learn, educate himself, or better\nhimself. This country has no lessons to teach. It neither promises\nnor a\u0000ords glimpses. It is satis\u0000ed to give, but in abundance. It is\ncompletely accessible to the eyes, and you know it the moment you\nenjoy it. Its pleasures are without remedy and its joys without hope.\nAbove all, it requires clairvoyant souls—that is, without solace. It\ninsists upon one’s performing an act of lucidity as one performs an\nact of faith. Strange country that gives the man it nourishes both his\nsplendor and his misery! It is not surprising that the sensual riches\ngranted to a sensitive man of these regions should coincide with the\nmost extreme destitution. No truth fails to carry with it its\nbitterness. How can one be surprised, then, if I never feel more\na\u0000ection for the face of this country than amid its poorest men?\nDuring their entire youth men \u0000nd here a life in proportion to\ntheir beauty. Then, later on, the downhill slope and obscurity. They\nwagered on the \u0000esh, but knowing they were to lose. In Algiers\nwhoever is young and alive \u0000nds sanctuary and occasion for\ntriumphs everywhere: in the bay, the sun, the red and white games\non the seaward terraces, the \u0000owers and sports stadiums, the cool-\n\f\nlegged girls. But for whoever has lost his youth there is nothing to\ncling to and nowhere where melancholy can escape itself.\nElsewhere, Italian terraces, European cloisters, or the pro\u0000le of the\nProvençal hills—all places where man can \u0000ee his humanity and\ngently liberate himself from himself. But everything here calls for\nsolitude and the blood of young men. Goethe on his deathbed calls\nfor light and this is a historic remark. At Belcourt and Bab-el-Oued\nold men seated in the depths of cafés listen to the bragging of\nyoung men with plastered hair.\nSummer betrays these beginnings and ends to us in Algiers.\nDuring those months the city is deserted. But the poor remain, and\nthe sky. We join the former as they go down toward the harbor and\nman’s treasures: warmth of the water and the brown bodies of\nwomen. In the evening, sated with such wealth, they return to the\noilcloth and kerosene lamp that constitute the whole setting of their\nlife.\n* * *\nIn Algiers no one says “go for a swim,” but rather “indulge in a\nswim.” The implications are clear. People swim in the harbor and\ngo to rest on the buoys. Anyone who passes near a buoy where a\npretty girl already is sunning herself shouts to his friends: “I tell you\nit’s a seagull.” These are healthy amusements. They must obviously\nconstitute the ideal of those youths, since most of them continue the\nsame life in the winter, undressing every day at noon for a frugal\nlunch in the sun. Not that they have read the boring sermons of the\nnudists, those Protestants of the \u0000esh (there is a theory of the body\nquite as tiresome as that of the mind). But they are simply\n“comfortable in the sunlight.” The importance of this custom for our\nepoch can never be overestimated. For the \u0000rst time in two\nthousand years the body has appeared naked on beaches. For\ntwenty centuries men have striven to give decency to Greek\ninsolence and naïveté, to diminish the \u0000esh and complicate dress.\nToday, despite that history, young men running on Mediterranean\nbeaches repeat the gestures of the athletes of Delos. And living thus\n\f\namong bodies and through one’s body, one becomes aware that it\nhas its connotations, its life, and, to risk nonsense, a psychology of\nits own.1 The body’s evolution, like that of the mind, has its history,\nits vicissitudes, its progress, and its de\u0000ciency. With this distinction,\nhowever: color. When you frequent the beach in summer you\nbecome aware of a simultaneous progression of all skins from white\nto golden to tanned, ending up in a tobacco color which marks the\nextreme limit of the e\u0000ort of transformation of which the body is\ncapable. Above the harbor stands the set of white cubes of the\nKasbah. When you are at water level, against the sharp white\nbackground of the Arab town the bodies describe a copper-colored\nfrieze. And as the month of August progresses and the sun grows,\nthe white of the houses becomes more blinding and skins take on a\ndarker warmth. How can one fail to participate, then, in that\ndialogue of stone and \u0000esh in tune with the sun and seasons? The\nwhole morning has been spent in diving, in bursts of laughter amid\nsplashing water, in vigorous paddles around the red and black\nfreighters (those from Norway with all the scents of wood, those\nthat come from Germany full of the smell of oil, those that go up\nand down the coast and smell of wine and old casks). At the hour\nwhen the sun over\u0000ows from every corner of the sky at once, the\norange canoe loaded with brown bodies brings us home in a mad\nrace. And when, having suddenly interrupted the cadenced beat of\nthe double paddle’s bright-colored wings, we glide slowly in the\ncalm water of the inner harbor, how can I fail to feel that I am\npiloting through the smooth waters a savage cargo of gods in whom\nI recognize my brothers?\nBut at the other end of the city summer is already o\u0000ering us, by\nway of contrast, its other riches: I mean its silence and its boredom.\nThat silence is not always of the same quality, depending on\nwhether it springs from the shade or the sunlight. There is the\nsilence of noon on the Place du Gouvernement. In the shade of the\ntrees surrounding it, Arabs sell for \u0000ve sous glasses of iced\nlemonade \u0000avored with orange-\u0000owers. Their cry “Cool, cool” can\nbe heard across the empty square. After their cry silence again falls\nunder the burning sun: in the vendor’s jug the ice moves and I can\n\f\nhear its tinkle. There is the silence of the siesta. In the streets of the\nMarine, in front of the dirty barbershops it can be measured in the\nmelodious buzzing of \u0000ies behind the hollow reed curtains.\nElsewhere, in the Moorish cafés of the Kasbah the body is silent,\nunable to tear itself away, to leave the glass of tea and rediscover\ntime with the pulsing of its own blood. But, above all, there is the\nsilence of summer evenings.\nThose brief moments when day topples into night must be\npeopled with secret signs and summons for my Algiers to be so\nclosely linked to them. When I spend some time far from that town,\nI imagine its twilights as promises of happiness. On the hills above\nthe city there are paths among the mastics and olive trees. And\ntoward them my heart turns at such moments. I see \u0000ights of black\nbirds rise against the green horizon. In the sky suddenly divested of\nits sun something relaxes. A whole little nation of red clouds\nstretches out until it is absorbed in the air. Almost immediately\nafterward appears the \u0000rst star that had been seen taking shape and\nconsistency in the depth of the sky. And then suddenly, all\nconsuming, night. What exceptional quality do the fugitive Algerian\nevenings possess to be able to release so many things in me? I\nhaven’t time to tire of that sweetness they leave on my lips before it\nhas disappeared into night. Is this the secret of its persistence? This\ncountry’s a\u0000ection is overwhelming and furtive. But during the\nmoment it is present, one’s heart at least surrenders completely to\nit. At Padovani Beach the dance hall is open every day. And in that\nhuge rectangular box with its entire side open to the sea, the poor\nyoung people of the neighborhood dance until evening. Often I used\nto await there a moment of exceptional beauty. During the day the\nhall is protected by sloping wooden awnings. When the sun goes\ndown they are raised. Then the hall is \u0000lled with an odd green light\nborn of the double shell of the sky and the sea. When one is seated\nfar from the windows, one sees only the sky and, silhouetted\nagainst it, the faces of the dancers passing in succession. Sometimes\na waltz is being played, and against the green background the black\npro\u0000les whirl obstinately like those cut-out silhouettes that are\nattached to a phonograph’s turntable. Night comes rapidly after this,\n\f\nand with it the lights. But I am unable to relate the thrill and\nsecrecy that subtle instant holds for me. I recall at least a\nmagni\u0000cent tall girl who had danced all afternoon. She was wearing\na jasmine garland on her tight blue dress, wet with perspiration\nfrom the small of her back to her legs. She was laughing as she\ndanced and throwing back her head. As she passed the tables, she\nleft behind her a mingled scent of \u0000owers and \u0000esh. When evening\ncame, I could no longer see her body pressed tight to her partner,\nbut against the sky whirled alternating spots of white jasmine and\nblack hair, and when she would throw back her swelling breast I\nwould hear her laugh and see her partner’s pro\u0000le suddenly plunge\nforward. I owe to such evenings the idea I have of innocence. In any\ncase, I learn not to separate these creatures bursting with violent\nenergy from the sky where their desires whirl.\n* * *\nIn the neighborhood movies in Algiers peppermint lozenges are\nsometimes sold with, stamped in red, all that is necessary to the\nawakening of love: (1) questions: “When will you marry me?” “Do\nyou love me?” and (2) replies: “Madly,” “Next spring.” After having\nprepared the way, you pass them to your neighbor, who answers\nlikewise or else turns a deaf ear. At Belcourt marriages have been\narranged this way and whole lives been pledged by the mere\nexchange of peppermint lozenges. And this really depicts the\nchildlike people of this region.\nThe distinguishing mark of youth is perhaps a magni\u0000cent\nvocation for facile joys. But, above all, it is a haste to live that\nborders on waste. At Belcourt, as at Bab-el-Oued, people get\nmarried young. They go to work early and in ten years exhaust the\nexperience of a lifetime. A thirty-year-old workman has already\nplayed all the cards in his hand. He awaits the end between his wife\nand his children. His joys have been sudden and merciless, as has\nbeen his life. One realizes that he is born of this country where\neverything is given to be taken away. In that plenty and profusion\nlife follows the sweep of great passions, sudden, exacting, and\n\f\ngenerous. It is not to be built up, but to be burned up. Stopping to\nthink and becoming better are out of the question. The notion of\nhell, for instance, is merely a funny joke here. Such imaginings are\nallowed only to the very virtuous. And I really think that virtue is a\nmeaningless word in all Algeria. Not that these men lack principles.\nThey have their code, and a very special one. You are not\ndisrespectful to your mother. You see that your wife is respected in\nthe street. You show consideration for a pregnant woman. You don’t\ndouble up on an adversary, because “that looks bad.” Whoever does\nnot observe these elementary commandments “is not a man,” and\nthe question is decided. This strikes me as fair and strong. There are\nstill many of us who automatically observe this code of the street,\nthe only disinterested one I know. But at the same time the\nshopkeeper’s ethics are unknown. I have always seen faces around\nme \u0000lled with pity at the sight of a man between two policemen.\nAnd before knowing whether the man had stolen, killed his father,\nor was merely a nonconformist, they would say: “The poor fellow,”\nor else, with a hint of admiration: “He’s a pirate, all right.”\nThere are races born for pride and life. They are the ones that\nnourish the strangest vocation for boredom. It is also among them\nthat the attitude toward death is the most repulsive. Aside from\nsensual pleasure, the amusements of this race are among the silliest.\nA society of bowlers and association banquets, the three-franc\nmovies and parish feasts have for years provided the recreation of\nthose over thirty. Algiers Sundays are among the most sinister.\nHow, then, could this race devoid of spirituality clothe in myths the\nprofound horror of its life? Everything related to death is either\nridiculous or hateful here. This populace without religion and\nwithout idols dies alone after having lived in a crowd. I know no\nmore hideous spot than the cemetery on Boulevard Bru, opposite\none of the most beautiful landscapes in the world. An accumulation\nof bad taste among the black fencings allows a dreadful melancholy\nto rise from this spot where death shows her true likeness.\n“Everything fades,” say the heart-shaped ex-votos, “except\nmemory.” And all insist on that paltry eternity provided us cheaply\nby the hearts of those who loved us. The same words \u0000t all\n\f\ndespairs. Addressed to the dead man, they speak to him in the\nsecond person (our memory will never forsake you); lugubrious\npretense which attributes a body and desires to what is at best a\nblack liquid. Elsewhere, amid a deadly profusion of marble \u0000owers\nand birds, this bold assertion: “Never will your grave be without\n\u0000owers.” But never fear: the inscription surrounds a gilded stucco\nbouquet, very time-saving for the living (like those immortelles\nwhich owe their pompous name to the gratitude of those who still\njump onto moving buses). Inasmuch as it is essential to keep up\nwith the times, the classic warbler is sometimes replaced by an\nastounding pearl airplane piloted by a silly angel who, without\nregard for logic, is provided with an impressive pair of wings.\nYet how to bring out that these images of death are never\nseparated from life? Here the values are closely linked. The favorite\njoke of Algerian undertakers, when driving an empty hearse, is to\nshout: “Want a ride, sister?” to any pretty girls they meet on the\nway. There is no objection to seeing a symbol in this, even if\nsomewhat untoward. It may seem blasphemous, likewise, to reply\nto the announcement of a death while winking one’s left eye: “Poor\nfellow, he’ll never sing again,” or, like that woman of Oran who\nhad never loved her husband: “God gave him to me and God has\ntaken him from me.” But, all in all, I see nothing sacred in death\nand am well aware, on the other hand, of the distance there is\nbetween fear and respect. Everything here suggests the horror of\ndying in a country that invites one to live. And yet it is under the\nvery walls of this cemetery that the young of Belcourt have their\nassignations and that the girls o\u0000er themselves to kisses and\ncaresses.\nI am well aware that such a race cannot be accepted by all. Here\nintelligence has no place as in Italy. This race is indi\u0000erent to the\nmind. It has a cult for and admiration of the body. Whence its\nstrength, its innocent cynicism, and a puerile vanity which explains\nwhy it is so severely judged. It is commonly blamed for its\n“mentality”—that is, a way of seeing and of living. And it is true\nthat a certain intensity of life is inseparable from injustice. Yet here\nis a race without past, without tradition, and yet not without poetry\n\f\n—but a poetry whose quality I know well, harsh, carnal, far from\ntenderness, that of their very sky, the only one in truth to move me\nand bring me inner peace. The contrary of a civilized nation is a\ncreative nation. I have the mad hope that, without knowing it\nperhaps, these barbarians lounging on beaches are actually\nmodeling the image of a culture in which the greatness of man will\nat last \u0000nd its true likeness. This race, wholly cast into its present,\nlives without myths, without solace. It has put all its possessions on\nthis earth and therefore remains without defense against death. All\nthe gifts of physical beauty have been lavished on it. And with\nthem, the strange avidity that always accompanies that wealth\nwithout future. Everything that is done here shows a horror of\nstability and a disregard for the future. People are in haste to live,\nand if an art were to be born here it would obey that hatred of\npermanence that made the Dorians fashion their \u0000rst column in\nwood. And yet, yes, one can \u0000nd measure as well as excess in the\nviolent and keen face of this race, in this summer sky with nothing\ntender in it, before which all truths can be uttered and on which no\ndeceptive divinity has traced the signs of hope or of redemption.\nBetween this sky and these faces turned toward it, nothing on which\nto hang a mythology, a literature, an ethic, or a religion, but stones,\n\u0000esh, stars, and those truths the hand can touch.\n* * *\nTo feel one’s attachment to a certain region, one’s love for a\ncertain group of men, to know that there is always a spot where\none’s heart will feel at peace—these are many certainties for a\nsingle human life. And yet this is not enough. But at certain\nmoments everything yearns for that spiritual home. “Yes, we must\ngo back there—there, indeed.” Is there anything odd in \u0000nding on\nearth that union that Plotinus longed for? Unity is expressed here in\nterms of sun and sea. The heart is sensitive to it through a certain\nsavor of \u0000esh which constitutes its bitterness and its grandeur. I\nlearn that there is no superhuman happiness, no eternity outside the\nsweep of days. These paltry and essential belongings, these relative\n\f\ntruths are the only ones to stir me. As for the others, the “ideal”\ntruths, I have not enough soul to understand them. Not that one\nmust be an animal, but I \u0000nd no meaning in the happiness of angels.\nI know simply that this sky will last longer than I. And what shall I\ncall eternity except what will continue after my death? I am not\nexpressing here the creature’s satisfaction with his condition. It is\nquite a di\u0000erent matter. It is not always easy to be a man, still less\nto be a pure man. But being pure is recovering that spiritual home\nwhere one can feel the world’s relationship, where one’s pulse-beats\ncoincide with the violent throbbing of the two-o’clock sun. It is well\nknown that one’s native land is always recognized at the moment of\nlosing it. For those who are too uneasy about themselves, their\nnative land is the one that negates them. I should not like to be\nbrutal or seem extravagant. But, after all, what negates me in this\nlife is \u0000rst of all what kills me. Everything that exalts life at the\nsame time increases its absurdity. In the Algerian summer I learn\nthat one thing only is more tragic than su\u0000ering, and that is the life\nof a happy man. But it may be also the way to a greater life because\nit leads to not cheating.\nMany, in fact, feign love of life to evade love itself. They try their\nskill at enjoyment and at “indulging in experiences.” But this is\nillusory. It requires a rare vocation to be a sensualist. The life of a\nman is ful\u0000lled without the aid of his mind, with its backward and\nforward movements, at one and the same time its solitude and its\npresences. To see these men of Belcourt working, protecting their\nwives and children, and often without a reproach, I think one can\nfeel a secret shame. To be sure, I have no illusions about it. There is\nnot much love in the lives I am speaking of. I ought to say that not\nmuch remains. But at least they have evaded nothing. There are\nwords I have never really understood, such as “sin.” Yet I believe\nthese men have never sinned against life. For if there is a sin against\nlife, it consists perhaps not so much in despairing of life as in\nhoping for another life and in eluding the implacable grandeur of\nthis life. These men have not cheated. Gods of summer they were at\ntwenty by their enthusiasm for life, and they still are, deprived of\nall hope. I have seen two of them die. They were full of horror, but\n\f\nsilent. It is better thus. From Pandora’s box, where all the ills of\nhumanity swarmed, the Greeks drew out hope after all the others,\nas the most dreadful of all. I know no more stirring symbol; for,\ncontrary to the general belief, hope equals resignation. And to live\nis not to resign oneself.\nThis, at least, is the bitter lesson of Algerian summers. But\nalready the season is wavering and summer totters. The \u0000rst\nSeptember rains, after such violence and hardening, are like the\nliberated earth’s \u0000rst tears, as if for a few days this country tried its\nhand at tenderness. Yet at the same period the carob trees cover all\nof Algeria with a scent of love. In the evening or after the rain, the\nwhole earth, its womb moist with a seed redolent of bitter almond,\nrests after having given herself to the sun all summer long. And\nagain that scent hallows the union of man and earth and awakens in\nus the only really virile love in this world: ephemeral and noble.\n(1936)\n1 May I take the ridiculous position of saying that I do not like the way Gide exalts the\nbody? He asks it to restrain its desire to make it keener. Thus he comes dangerously near to\nthose who in brothel slang are called involved or brain-workers. Christianity also wants to\nsuspend desire. But, more natural, it sees a morti\u0000cation in this. My friend Vincent, who is\na cooper and junior breast-stroke champion, has an even clearer view. He drinks when he is\nthirsty, if he desires a woman tries to go to bed with her, and would marry her if he loved\nher (this hasn’t yet happened). Afterward he always says: “I feel better”—and this sums up\nvigorously any apology that might be made for satiety.\n\f\nTHE MINOTAUR\nOR\nTHE STOP IN ORAN\nfor\n                       PIERRE GALINDO"

    "raw_text": "THIS ESSAY dates from 1939. The reader will have to bear this in mind\nto judge of the present-day Oran. Impassioned protests from that\nbeautiful city assure me, as a matter of fact, that all the\nimperfections have been (or will be) remedied. On the other hand,\nthe beauties extolled in this essay have been jealously respected.\nHappy and realistic city, Oran has no further need of writers: she is\nawaiting tourists.\n(1953)\n\f\nT\n \nHERE ARE no more deserts. There are no more islands. Yet there\nis a need for them. In order to understand the world, one\nhas to turn away from it on occasion; in order to serve men better,\none has to hold them at a distance for a time. But where can one\n\u0000nd the solitude necessary to vigor, the deep breath in which the\nmind collects itself and courage gauges its strength? There remain\nbig cities. Simply, certain conditions are required.\nThe cities Europe o\u0000ers us are too full of the din of the past. A\npracticed ear can make out the \u0000apping of wings, a \u0000uttering of\nsouls. The giddy whirl of centuries, of revolutions, of fame can be\nfelt there. There one cannot forget that the Occident was forged in a\nseries of uproars. All that does not make for enough silence.\nParis is often a desert for the heart, but at certain moments from\nthe heights of Père-Lachaise there blows a revolutionary wind that\nsuddenly \u0000lls that desert with \u0000ags and fallen glories. So it is with\ncertain Spanish towns, with Florence or with Prague. Salzburg\nwould be peaceful without Mozart. But from time to time there\nrings out over the Salzach the great proud cry of Don Juan as he\nplunges toward hell. Vienna seems more silent; she is a youngster\namong cities. Her stones are no older than three centuries and their\nyouth is ignorant of melancholy. But Vienna stands at a crossroads\nof history. Around her echoes the clash of empires. Certain evenings\nwhen the sky is su\u0000used with blood, the stone horses on the Ring\nmonuments seem to take wing. In that \u0000eeting moment when\neverything is reminiscent of power and history, can be distinctly\nheard, under the charge of the Polish squadrons, the crashing fall of\nthe Ottoman Empire. That does not make for enough silence either.\nTo be sure, it is just that solitude amid others that men come\nlooking for in European cities. At least, men with a purpose in life.\nThere they can choose their company, take it or leave it. How many\nminds have been tempered in the trip between their hotel room and\nthe old stones of the Ile Saint-Louis! It is true that others have died"

    "raw_text": "there of isolation. As for the \u0000rst, at any rate, there they found their\nreasons for growing and asserting themselves. They were alone and\nthey weren’t alone. Centuries of history and beauty, the ardent\ntestimony of a thousand lives of the past accompanied them along\nthe Seine and spoke to them both of traditions and of conquests. But\ntheir youth urged them to invite such company. There comes a\ntime, there come periods, when it is unwelcome. “It’s between us\ntwo!” exclaims Rastignac, facing the vast mustiness of Paris. Two,\nyes, but that is still too many!\nThe desert itself has assumed signi\u0000cance; it has been glutted\nwith poetry. For all the world’s sorrows it is a hallowed spot. But at\ncertain moments the heart wants nothing so much as spots devoid of\npoetry. Descartes, planning to meditate, chose his desert: the most\nmercantile city of his era. There he found his solitude and the\noccasion for perhaps the greatest of our virile poems: “The \u0000rst\n[precept] was never to accept anything as true unless I knew it to\nbe obviously so.” It is possible to have less ambition and the same\nnostalgia. But during the last three centuries Amsterdam has\nspawned museums. In order to \u0000ee poetry and yet recapture the\npeace of stones, other deserts are needed, other spots without soul\nand without reprieve. Oran is one of these.\nThe Street\nI have often heard the people of Oran complain: “There is no\ninteresting circle.” No, indeed! You wouldn’t want one! A few right-\nthinking people tried to introduce the customs of another world into\nthis desert, faithful to the principle that it is impossible to advance\nart or ideas without grouping together.1 The result is such that the\nonly instructive circles remain those of poker-players, boxing\nenthusiasts, bowlers, and the local associations. There at least the\nunsophisticated prevails. After all, there exists a certain nobility that\ndoes not lend itself to the lofty. It is sterile by nature. And those\nwho want to \u0000nd it leave the “circles” and go out into the street."

    "raw_text": "The streets of Oran are doomed to dust, pebbles, and heat. If it\nrains, there is a deluge and a sea of mud. But rain or shine, the\nshops have the same extravagant and absurd look. All the bad taste\nof Europe and the Orient has managed to converge in them. One\n\u0000nds, helterskelter, marble greyhounds, ballerinas with swans,\nversions of Diana the huntress in green galalith, discus-throwers and\nreapers, everything that is used for birthday and wedding gifts, the\nwhole race of painful \u0000gurines constantly called forth by a\ncommercial and playful genie on our mantelpieces. But such\nperseverance in bad taste takes on a baroque aspect that makes one\nforgive all. Here, presented in a casket of dust, are the contents of a\nshow window: frightful plaster models of deformed feet, a group of\nRembrandt drawings “sacri\u0000ced at 150 francs each,” practical jokes,\ntricolored wallets, an eighteenth-century pastel, a mechanical\ndonkey made of plush, bottles of Provence water for preserving\ngreen olives, and a wretched wooden virgin with an indecent smile.\n(So that no one can go away ignorant, the “management” has\npropped at its base a card saying: “Wooden Virgin.”)\nThere can be found in Oran:\n  1) Cafés with \u0000lth-glazed counters sprinkled with the legs and\nwings of \u0000ies, the proprietor always smiling despite his always\nempty café. A small black co\u0000ee used to cost twelve sous and a\nlarge one eighteen.\n  2) Photographers’ studios where there has been no progress in\ntechnique since the invention of sensitized paper. They exhibit a\nstrange fauna impossible to encounter in the streets, from the\npseudo-sailor leaning on a console table to the marriageable girl,\nbadly dressed and arms dangling, standing in front of a sylvan\nbackground. It is possible to assume that these are not portraits\nfrom life: they are creations.\n  3) An edifying abundance of funeral establishments. It is not\nthat people die more in Oran than elsewhere, but I fancy merely\nthat more is made of it.\nThe attractive naïveté of this nation of merchants is displayed\neven in their advertising. I read, in the handbill of an Oran movie\ntheater, the advertisement for a third-rate \u0000lm. I note the adjectives\n\f\n“sumptuous,” “splendid,” “extraordinary,” “amazing,” “staggering,”\nand “tremendous.” At the end the management informs the public of\nthe considerable sacri\u0000ces it has undertaken to be able to present\nthis startling “realization.” Nevertheless, the price of tickets will not\nbe increased.\nIt would be wrong to assume that this is merely a manifestation\nof that love of exaggeration characteristic of the south. Rather, the\nauthors of this marvelous handbill are revealing their sense of\npsychology. It is essential to overcome the indi\u0000erence and\nprofound apathy felt in this country the moment there is any\nquestion of choosing between two shows, two careers, and, often,\neven two women. People make up their minds only when forced to\ndo so. And advertising is well aware of this. It will assume\nAmerican proportions, having the same reasons, both here and\nthere, for getting desperate.\nThe streets of Oran inform us as to the two essential pleasures of\nthe local youth: getting one’s shoes shined and displaying those\nsame shoes on the boulevard. In order to have a clear idea of the\n\u0000rst of these delights, one has to entrust one’s shoes, at ten o’clock\non a Sunday morning, to the shoe-shiners in Boulevard Galliéni.\nPerched on high armchairs, one can enjoy that peculiar satisfaction\nproduced, even upon a rank outsider, by the sight of men in love\nwith their job, as the shoe-shiners of Oran obviously are. Everything\nis worked over in detail. Several brushes, three kinds of cloths, the\npolish mixed with gasoline. One might think the operation is\n\u0000nished when a perfect shine comes to life under the soft brush. But\nthe same insistent hand covers the glossy surface again with polish,\nrubs it, dulls it, makes the cream penetrate the heart of the leather,\nand then brings forth, under the same brush, a double and really\nde\u0000nitive gloss sprung from the depths of the leather.\nThe wonders achieved in this way are then exhibited to the\nconnoisseurs. In order to appreciate such pleasures of the boulevard,\nyou ought to see the masquerade of youth taking place every\nevening on the main arteries of the city. Between the ages of\nsixteen and twenty the young people of Oran “Society” borrow their\nmodels of elegance from American \u0000lms and put on their fancy\n\f\ndress before going out to dinner. With wavy, oiled hair protruding\nfrom under a felt hat slanted over the left ear and peaked over the\nright eye, the neck encircled by a collar big enough to accommodate\nthe straggling hair, the microscopic knot of the necktie kept in place\nby a regulation pin, with thigh-length coat and waist close to the\nhips, with light-colored and noticeably short trousers, with\ndazzlingly shiny triple-soled shoes, every evening those youths\nmake the sidewalks ring with their metal-tipped soles. In all things\nthey are bent on imitating the bearing, forthrightness, and\nsuperiority of Mr. Clark Gable. For this reason the local carpers\ncommonly nickname those youths, by favor of a casual\npronunciation, “Clarques.”\nAt any rate, the main boulevards of Oran are invaded late in the\nafternoon by an army of attractive adolescents who go to the\ngreatest trouble to look like a bad lot. Inasmuch as the girls of Oran\nfeel traditionally engaged to these softhearted gangsters, they\nlikewise \u0000aunt the make-up and elegance of popular American\nactresses. Consequently, the same wits call them “Marlenes.” Thus\non the evening boulevards when the sound of birds rises skyward\nfrom the palm trees, dozens of Clarques and Marlenes meet, eye\nand size up one another, happy to be alive and to cut a \u0000gure,\nindulging for an hour in the intoxication of perfect existences. There\ncan then be witnessed, the jealous say, the meetings of the\nAmerican Commission. But in these words lies the bitterness of\nthose over thirty who have no connection with such diversions.\nThey fail to appreciate those daily congresses of youth and\nromance. These are, in truth, the parliaments of birds that are met\nin Hindu literature. But no one on the boulevards of Oran debates\nthe problem of being or worries about the way to perfection. There\nremains nothing but \u0000appings of wings, plumed struttings,\ncoquettish and victorious graces, a great burst of carefree song that\ndisappears with the night.\nFrom here I can hear Klestakov: “I shall soon have to be\nconcerned with something lofty.” Alas, he is quite capable of it! If\nhe were urged, he would people this desert within a few years. But\nfor the moment a somewhat secret soul must liberate itself in this"

Perhaps, indeed, all this is not su\u0000ciently\nlofty. But the great value of such overpopulated islands is that in\nthem the heart strips bare. Silence is no longer possible except in\nnoisy cities.

One expects to \u0000nd a city open to the sea,\nwashed and refreshed by the evening breeze. And aside from the\nSpanish quarter,3 one \u0000nds a walled town that turns its back to the\nsea, that has been built up by turning back on itself like a snail.\nOran is a great circular yellow wall covered over with a leaden sky.\nIn the beginning you wander in the labyrinth, seeking the sea like\nthe sign of Ariadne.

    "raw_text": "vegetable kingdom here takes on a stone face. The hundred or so\ntrees that can be found in the business section have been carefully\ncovered with dust. They are petri\u0000ed plants whose branches give o\u0000\nan acrid, dusty smell. In Algiers the Arab cemeteries have a well-\nknown mellowness. In Oran, above the Ras-el-Aïn ravine, facing the\nsea this time, \u0000at against the blue sky, are \u0000elds of chalky, friable\npebbles in which the sun blinds with its \u0000res. Amid these bare bones\nof the earth a purple geranium, from time to time, contributes its\nlife and fresh blood to the landscape. The whole city has solidi\u0000ed\nin a stony matrix. Seen from Les Planteurs, the depth of the cli\u0000s\nsurrounding it is so great that the landscape becomes unreal, so\nmineral it is. Man is outlawed from it. So much heavy beauty seems\nto come from another world.\nIf the desert can be de\u0000ned as a soulless place where the sky\nalone is king, then Oran is awaiting her prophets. All around and\nabove the city the brutal nature of Africa is indeed clad in her\nburning charms. She bursts the unfortunate stage setting with which\nshe is covered; she shrieks forth between all the houses and over all\nthe roofs. If one climbs one of the roads up the mountain of Santa-\nCruz, the \u0000rst thing to be visible is the scattered colored cubes of\nOran. But a little higher and already the jagged cli\u0000s that surround\nthe plateau crouch in the sea like red beasts. Still a little higher and\na great vortex of sun and wind sweeps over, airs out, and obscures\nthe untidy city scattered in disorder all over a rocky landscape. The\nopposition here is between magni\u0000cent human anarchy and the\npermanence of an unchanging sea. This is enough to make a\nstaggering scent of life rise toward the mountainside road.\nThere is something implacable about the desert. The mineral sky\nof Oran, her streets and trees in their coating of dust—everything\ncontributes to creating this dense and impassible universe in which\nthe heart and mind are never distracted from themselves, nor from\ntheir sole object, which is man. I am speaking here of di\u0000cult\nplaces of retreat. Books are written on Florence or Athens. Those\ncities have formed so many European minds that they must have a\nmeaning. They have the means of moving to tears or of uplifting.\nThey quiet a certain spiritual hunger whose bread is memory. But\n\f\ncan one be moved by a city where nothing attracts the mind, where\nthe very ugliness is anonymous, where the past is reduced to\nnothing? Emptiness, boredom, an indi\u0000erent sky, what are the\ncharms of such places? Doubtless solitude and, perhaps, the human\ncreature. For a certain race of men, wherever the human creature is\nbeautiful is a bitter native land. Oran is one of its thousand capitals.\nSports\nThe Central Sporting Club, on rue du Fondouk in Oran, is giving\nan evening of boxing which it insists will be appreciated by real\nenthusiasts. Interpreted, this means that the boxers on the bill are\nfar from being stars, that some of them are entering the ring for the\n\u0000rst time, and that consequently you can count, if not on the skill,\nat least on the courage of the opponents. A native having thrilled\nme with the \u0000rm promise that “blood would \u0000ow,” I \u0000nd myself\nthat evening among the real enthusiasts.\nApparently the latter never insist on comfort. To be sure, a ring\nhas been set up at the back of a sort of whitewashed garage,\ncovered with corrugated iron and violently lighted. Folding chairs\nhave been lined up in a square around the ropes. These are the\n“honor rings.” Most of the length of the hall has been \u0000lled with\nseats, and behind them opens a large free space called “lounge” by\nreason of the fact that not one of the \u0000ve hundred persons in it\ncould take out a handkerchief without causing serious accidents. In\nthis rectangular box live and breathe some thousand men and two\nor three women—the kind who, according to my neighbor, always\ninsist on “attracting attention.” Everybody is sweating \u0000ercely.\nWhile waiting for the \u0000ghts of the “young hopefuls” a gigantic\nphonograph grinds out a Tino Rossi record. This is the sentimental\nsong before the murder.\nThe patience of a true enthusiast is unlimited. The \u0000ght\nannounced for nine o’clock has not even begun at nine thirty and no\none has protested. The spring weather is warm and the smell of a\nhumanity in shirt sleeves is exciting. Lively discussion goes on\n\f\namong the periodic explosions of lemon-soda corks and the tireless\nlament of the Corsican singer. A few late arrivals are wedged into\nthe audience when a spotlight throws a blinding light onto the ring.\nThe \u0000ghts of the young hopefuls begin.\nThe young hopefuls, or beginners, who are \u0000ghting for the fun of\nit, are always eager to prove this by massacring each other at the\nearliest opportunity, in de\u0000ance of technique. They were never able\nto last more than three rounds. The hero of the evening in this\nregard is young “Kid Airplane,” who in regular life sells lottery\ntickets on café terraces. His opponent, indeed, hurtled awkwardly\nout of the ring at the beginning of the second round after contact\nwith a \u0000st wielded like a propeller.\nThe crowd got somewhat excited, but this is still an act of\ncourtesy. Gravely it breathes in the hallowed air of the\nembrocation. It watches these series of slow rites and unregulated\nsacri\u0000ces, made even more authentic by the propitiatory designs, on\nthe white wall, of the \u0000ghters’ shadows. These are the deliberate\nceremonial prologues of a savage religion. The trance will not come\nuntil later.\nAnd it so happens that the loudspeaker announces Amar, “the\ntough Oranese who has never disarmed,” against Pérez, “the slugger\nfrom Algiers.” An uninitiate would misinterpret the yelling that\ngreets the introduction of the boxers in the ring. He would imagine\nsome sensational combat in which the boxers were to settle a\npersonal quarrel known to the public. To tell the truth, it is a\nquarrel they are going to settle. But it is the one that for the past\nhundred years has mortally separated Algiers and Oran. Back in\nhistory, these two North African cities would have already bled each\nother white as Pisa and Florence did in happier times. Their rivalry\nis all the stronger just because it probably has no basis. Having\nevery reason to like each other, they loathe each other\nproportionately. The Oranese accuse the citizens of Algiers of\n“sham.” The people of Algiers imply that the Oranese are rustic.\nThese are bloodier insults than they might seem because they are\nmetaphysical. And unable to lay siege to each other, Oran and\n\f\nAlgiers meet, compete, and insult each other on the \u0000eld of sports,\nstatistics, and public works.\nThus a page of history is unfolding in the ring. And the tough\nOranese, backed by a thousand yelling voices, is defending against\nPérez a way of life and the pride of a province. Truth forces me to\nadmit that Amar is not conducting his discussion well. His argument\nhas a \u0000aw: he lacks reach. The slugger from Algiers, on the\ncontrary, has the required reach in his argument. It lands\npersuasively between his contradictor’s eyes. The Oranese bleeds\nmagni\u0000cently amid the vociferations of a wild audience. Despite the\nrepeated encouragements of the gallery and of my neighbor, despite\nthe dauntless shouts of “Kill him!”, “Floor him!”, the insidious\n“Below the belt,” “Oh, the referee missed that one!,” the optimistic\n“He’s pooped,” “He can’t take any more,” nevertheless the man\nfrom Algiers is proclaimed the winner on points amid interminable\ncatcalls. My neighbor, who is inclined to talk of sportsmanship,\napplauds ostensibly, while slipping to me in a voice made faint by\nso many shouts: “So that he won’t be able to say back there that we\nof Oran are savages.”\nBut throughout the audience, \u0000ghts not included on the program\nhave already broken out. Chairs are brandished, the police clear a\npath, excitement is at its height. In order to calm these good people\nand contribute to the return of silence, the “management,” without\nlosing a moment, commissions the loudspeaker to boom out\n“Sambre-et-Meuse.” For a few minutes the audience has a really\nwarlike look. Confused clusters of combatants and voluntary\nreferees sway in the grip of policemen; the gallery exults and calls\nfor the rest of the program with wild cries, cock-a-doodle-doo’s, and\nmocking catcalls drowned in the irresistible \u0000ood from the military\nband.\nBut the announcement of the big \u0000ght is enough to restore calm.\nThis takes place suddenly, without \u0000ourishes, just as actors leave\nthe stage once the play is \u0000nished. With the greatest unconcern,\nhats are dusted o\u0000, chairs are put back in place, and without\ntransition all faces assume the kindly expression of the respectable"

    "raw_text": "member of the audience who has paid for his ticket to a family\nconcert.\nThe last \u0000ght pits a French champion of the Navy against an Oran\nboxer. This time the di\u0000erence in reach is to the advantage of the\nlatter. But his superiorities, during the \u0000rst rounds, do not stir the\ncrowd. They are sleeping o\u0000 the e\u0000ects of their \u0000rst excitement;\nthey are sobering up. They are still short of breath. If they applaud,\nthere is no passion in it. They hiss without animosity. The audience\nis divided into two camps, as is appropriate in the interest of\nfairness. But each individual’s choice obeys that indi\u0000erence that\nfollows on great expenditures of energy. If the Frenchman holds his\nown, if the Oranese forgets that one doesn’t lead with the head, the\nboxer is bent under a volley of hisses, but immediately pulled\nupright again by a burst of applause. Not until the seventh round\ndoes sport rise to the surface again, at the same time that the real\nenthusiasts begin to emerge from their fatigue. The Frenchman, to\ntell the truth, has touched the mat and, eager to win back points,\nhas hurled himself on his opponent. “What did I tell you?” said my\nneighbor; “it’s going to be a \u0000ght to the \u0000nish.” Indeed, it is a \u0000ght\nto the \u0000nish. Covered with sweat under the pitiless light, both\nboxers open their guard, close their eyes as they hit, shove with\nshoulders and knees, swap their blood, and snort with rage. As one\nman, the audience has stood up and punctuates the e\u0000orts of its two\nheroes. It receives the blows, returns them, echoes them in a\nthousand hollow, panting voices. The same ones who had chosen\ntheir favorite in indi\u0000erence cling to their choice through obstinacy\nand defend it passionately. Every ten seconds a shout from my\nneighbor pierces my right ear: “Go to it, gob; come on, Navy!”\nwhile another man in front of us shouts to the Oranese: “Anda!\nhombre!” The man and the gob go to it, and together with them, in\nthis temple of whitewash, iron, and cement, an audience completely\ngiven over to gods with cauli\u0000ower ears. Every blow that gives a\ndull sound on the shining pectorals echoes in vast vibrations in the\nvery body of the crowd, which, with the boxers, is making its last\ne\u0000ort.\n\f\nIn such an atmosphere a draw is badly received. Indeed, it runs\ncounter to a quite Manichean tendency in the audience. There is\ngood and there is evil, the winner and the loser. One must be either\nright or wrong. The conclusion of this impeccable logic is\nimmediately provided by two thousand energetic lungs accusing the\njudges of being sold, or bought. But the gob has walked over and\nembraced his rival in the ring, drinking in his fraternal sweat. This\nis enough to make the audience, reversing its view, burst out in\nsudden applause. My neighbor is right: they are not savages.\nThe crowd pouring out, under a sky full of silence and stars, has\njust fought the most exhausting \u0000ght. It keeps quiet and disappears\nfurtively, without any energy left for post mortems. There is good\nand there is evil; that religion is merciless. The band of faithful is\nnow no more than a group of black-and-white shadows disappearing\ninto the night. For force and violence are solitary gods. They\ncontribute nothing to memory. On the contrary, they distribute\ntheir miracles by the handful in the present. They are made for this\nrace without past which celebrates its communions around the prize\nring. These are rather di\u0000cult rites but ones that simplify\neverything. Good and evil, winner and loser. At Corinth two\ntemples stood side by side, the temple of Violence and the temple of\nNecessity.\nMonuments\nFor many reasons due as much to economics as to metaphysics, it\nmay be said that the Oranese style, if there is one, forcefully and\nclearly appears in the extraordinary edi\u0000ce called the Maison du\nColon. Oran hardly lacks monuments. The city has its quota of\nimperial marshals, ministers, and local benefactors. They are found\non dusty little squares, resigned to rain and sun, they too converted\nto stone and boredom. But, in any case, they represent contributions\nfrom the outside. In that happy barbary they are the regrettable\nmarks of civilization.\n\f\nOran, on the other hand, has raised up her altars and rostra to her\nown honor. In the very heart of the mercantile city, having to\nconstruct a common home for the innumerable agricultural\norganizations that keep this country alive, the people of Oran\nconceived the idea of building solidly a convincing image of their\nvirtues: the Maison du Colon. To judge from the edi\u0000ce, those\nvirtues are three in number: boldness in taste, love of violence, and\na feeling for historical syntheses. Egypt, Byzantium, and Munich\ncollaborated in the delicate construction of a piece of pastry in the\nshape of a bowl upside down. Multicolored stones, most vigorous in\ne\u0000ect, have been brought in to outline the roof. These mosaics are\nso exuberantly persuasive that at \u0000rst you see nothing but an\namorphous e\u0000ulgence. But with a closer view and your attention\ncalled to it, you discover that they have a meaning: a graceful\ncolonist, wearing a bow tie and white pith helmet, is receiving the\nhomage of a procession of slaves dressed in classical style.4 The\nedi\u0000ce and its colored illustrations have been set down in the\nmiddle of a square in the to-and-fro of the little two-car trams\nwhose \u0000lth is one of the charms of the city.\nOran greatly cherishes also the two lions of its Place d’Armes, or\nparade ground. Since 1888 they have been sitting in state on\nopposite sides of the municipal stairs. Their author was named Cain.\nThey have majesty and a stubby torso. It is said that at night they\nget down from their pedestal one after the other, silently pace\naround the dark square, and on occasion uninate at length under the\nbig, dusty \u0000cus trees. These, of course, are rumors to which the\npeople of Oran lend an indulgent ear. But it is unlikely.\nDespite a certain amount of research, I have not been able to get\ninterested in Cain. I merely learned that he had the reputation of\nbeing a skillful animal-sculptor. Yet I often think of him. This is an\nintellectual bent that comes naturally in Oran. Here is a sonorously\nnamed artist who left an unimportant work here. Several hundred\nthousand people are familiar with the easygoing beasts he put in\nfront of a pretentious town hall. This is one way of succeeding in\nart. To be sure, these two lions, like thousands of works of the same\ntype, are proof of something else than talent. Others have created"

    "raw_text": "“The Night Watch,” “Saint Francis Receiving the Stigmata,” “David,”\nor the Pharsalian bas-relief called “The Glori\u0000cation of the Flower.”\nCain, on the other hand, set up two hilarious snouts on the square of\na mercantile province overseas. But the David will go down one day\nwith Florence and the lions will perhaps be saved from the\ncatastrophe. Let me repeat, they are proof of something else.\nCan one state this idea clearly? In this work there are\ninsigni\u0000cance and solidity. Spirit counts for nothing and matter for\na great deal. Mediocrity insists upon lasting by all means, including\nbronze. It is refused a right to eternity, and every day it takes that\nright. Is it not eternity itself? In any event, such perseverance is\ncapable of stirring, and it involves its lesson, that of all the\nmonuments of Oran, and of Oran herself. An hour a day, every so\noften, it forces you to pay attention to something that has no\nimportance. The mind pro\u0000ts from such recurrences. In a sense this\nis its hygiene, and since it absolutely needs its moments of humility,\nit seems to me that this chance to indulge in stupidity is better than\nothers. Everything that is ephemeral wants to last. Let us say that\neverything wants to last. Human productions mean nothing else,\nand in this regard Cain’s lions have the same chances as the ruins of\nAngkor. This disposes one toward modesty.\nThere are other Oranese monuments. Or at least they deserve this\nname because they, too, stand for their city, and perhaps in a more\nsigni\u0000cant way. They are the public works at present covering the\ncoast for some ten kilometers. Apparently it is a matter of\ntransforming the most luminous of bays into a gigantic harbor. In\nreality it is one more chance for man to come to grips with stone.\nIn the paintings of certain Flemish masters a theme of strikingly\ngeneral application recurs insistently: the building of the Tower of\nBabel. Vast landscapes, rocks climbing up to heaven, steep slopes\nteeming with workmen, animals, ladders, strange machines, cords,\npulleys. Man, moreover, is there only to give scale to the inhuman\nscope of the construction. This is what the Oran coast makes one\nthink of, west of the city.\nClinging to vast slopes, rails, dump-cars, cranes, tiny\ntrains … Under a broiling sun, toy-like locomotives round huge\n\f\nblocks of stone amid whistles, dust, and smoke. Day and night a\nnation of ants bustles about on the smoking carcass of the mountain.\nClinging all up and down a single cord against the side of the cli\u0000,\ndozens of men, their bellies pushing against the handles of\nautomatic drills, vibrate in empty space all day long and break o\u0000\nwhole masses of rock that hurtle down in dust and rumbling.\nFarther on, dump-carts tip their loads over the slopes; and the rocks,\nsuddenly poured seaward, bound and roll into the water, each large\nlump followed by a scattering of lighter stones. At regular intervals,\nat dead of night or in broad daylight, detonations shake the whole\nmountain and stir up the sea itself.\nMan, in this vast construction \u0000eld, makes a frontal attack on\nstone. And if one could forget, for a moment at least, the harsh\nslavery that makes this work possible, one would have to admire.\nThese stones, torn from the mountain, serve man in his plans. They\npile up under the \u0000rst waves, gradually emerge, and \u0000nally take\ntheir place to form a jetty, soon covered with men and machines\nwhich advance, day after day, toward the open sea. Without\nstopping, huge steel jaws bite into the cli\u0000’s belly, turn round, and\ndisgorge into the water their over\u0000owing gravel. As the coastal cli\u0000\nis lowered, the whole coast encroaches irresistibly on the sea.\nOf course, destroying stone is not possible. It is merely moved\nfrom one place to another. In any case, it will last longer than the\nmen who use it. For the moment, it satis\u0000es their will to action.\nThat in itself is probably useless. But moving things about is the\nwork of men; one must choose doing that or nothing.5 Obviously\nthe people of Oran have chosen. In front of that indi\u0000erent bay, for\nmany years more they will pile up stones along the coast. In a\nhundred years—tomorrow, in other words—they will have to begin\nagain. But today these heaps of rocks testify for the men in masks of\ndust and sweat who move about among them. The true monuments\nof Oran are still her stones.\nAriadne’s Stone\n\f\nIt seems that the people of Oran are like that friend of Flaubert\nwho, on the point of death, casting a last glance at this irreplaceable\nearth, exclaimed: “Close the window; it’s too beautiful.” They have\nclosed the window, they have walled themselves in, they have cast\nout the landscape. But Flaubert’s friend, Le Poittevin, died, and\nafter him days continued to be added to days. Likewise, beyond the\nyellow walls of Oran, land and sea continue their indi\u0000erent\ndialogue. That permanence in the world has always had contrary\ncharms for man. It drives him to despair and excites him. The world\nnever says but one thing; \u0000rst it interests, then it bores. But\neventually it wins out by dint of obstinacy. It is always right.\nAlready, at the very gates of Oran, nature raises its voice. In the\ndirection of Canastel there are vast wastelands covered with\nfragrant brush. There sun and wind speak only of solitude. Above\nOran there is the mountain of Santa-Cruz, the plateau and the\nmyriad ravines leading to it. Roads, once carriageable, cling to the\nslopes overhanging the sea. In the month of January some are\ncovered with \u0000owers. Daisies and buttercups turn them into\nsumptuous paths, embroidered in yellow and white. About Santa-\nCruz everything has been said. But if I were to speak of it, I should\nforget the sacred processions that climb the rugged hill on feast\ndays, in order to recall other pilgrimages. Solitary, they walk in the\nred stone, rise above the motionless bay, and come to dedicate to\nnakedness a luminous, perfect hour.\nOran has also its deserts of sand: its beaches. Those encountered\nnear the gates are deserted only in winter and spring. Then they are\nplateaus covered with asphodels, peopled with bare little cottages\namong the \u0000owers. The sea rumbles a bit, down below. Yet already\nthe sun, the faint breeze, the whiteness of the asphodels, the sharp\nblue of the sky, everything makes one fancy summer—the golden\nyouth then covering the beach, the long hours on the sand and the\nsudden softness of evening. Each year on these shores there is a new\nharvest of girls in \u0000ower. Apparently they have but one season. The\nfollowing year, other cordial blossoms take their place, which, the\nsummer before, were still little girls with bodies as hard as buds. At\neleven a.m., coming down from the plateau, all that young \u0000esh,\n\f\nlightly clothed in motley materials, breaks on the sand like a\nmulticolored wave.\nOne has to go farther (strangely close, however, to that spot\nwhere two hundred thousand men are laboring) to discover a still\nvirgin landscape: long, deserted dunes where the passage of men\nhas left no other trace than a worm-eaten hut. From time to time an\nArab shepherd drives along the top of the dunes the black and beige\nspots of his \u0000ock of goats. On the beaches of the Oran country\nevery summer morning seems to be the \u0000rst in the world. Each\ntwilight seems to be the last, solemn agony, announced at sunset by\na \u0000nal glow that darkens every hue. The sea is ultramarine, the\nroad the color of clotted blood, the beach yellow. Everything\ndisappears with the green sun; an hour later the dunes are bathed in\nmoonlight. Then there are incomparable nights under a rain of stars.\nOccasionally storms sweep over them, and the lightning \u0000ashes \u0000ow\nalong the dunes, whiten the sky, and give the sand and one’s eyes\norange-colored glints.\nBut this cannot be shared. One has to have lived it. So much\nsolitude and nobility give these places an unforgettable aspect. In\nthe warm moment before daybreak, after confronting the \u0000rst\nbitter, black waves, a new creature breasts night’s heavy,\nenveloping water. The memory of those joys does not make me\nregret them, and thus I recognize that they were good. After so\nmany years they still last, somewhere in this heart which \u0000nds\nunswerving loyalty so di\u0000cult. And I know that today, if I were to\ngo to the deserted dune, the same sky would pour down on me its\ncargo of breezes and stars. These are lands of innocence.\nBut innocence needs sand and stones. And man has forgotten how\nto live among them. At least it seems so, for he has taken refuge in\nthis extraordinary city where boredom sleeps. Nevertheless, that\nvery confrontation constitutes the value of Oran. The capital of\nboredom, besieged by innocence and beauty, it is surrounded by an\narmy in which every stone is a soldier. In the city, and at certain\nhours, however, what a temptation to go over to the enemy! What a\ntemptation to identify oneself with those stones, to melt into that\nburning and impassive universe that de\u0000es history and its ferments!"

    "raw_text": "That is doubtless futile. But there is in every man a profound\ninstinct which is neither that of destruction nor that of creation. It is\nmerely a matter of resembling nothing. In the shadow of the warm\nwalls of Oran, on its dusty asphalt, that invitation is sometimes\nheard. It seems that, for a time, the minds that yield to it are never\ndisappointed. This is the darkness of Eurydice and the sleep of Isis.\nHere are the deserts where thought will collect itself, the cool hand\nof evening on a troubled heart. On this Mount of Olives, vigil is\nfutile; the mind recalls and approves the sleeping Apostles. Were\nthey really wrong? They nonetheless had their revelation.\nJust think of Sakyamuni in the desert. He remained there for\nyears on end, squatting motionless with his eyes on heaven. The\nvery gods envied him that wisdom and that stone-like destiny. In his\noutstretched hands the swallows had made their nest. But one day\nthey \u0000ew away, answering the call of distant lands. And he who had\nsti\u0000ed in himself desire and will, fame and su\u0000ering, began to cry.\nIt happens thus that \u0000owers grow on rocks. Yes, let us accept stone\nwhen it is necessary. That secret and that rapture we ask of faces\ncan also be given us by stone. To be sure, this cannot last. But what\ncan last, after all? The secret of faces fades away, and there we are,\ncast back to the chain of desires. And if stone can do no more for us\nthan the human heart, at least it can do just as much.\n“Oh, to be nothing!” For thousands of years this great cry has\nroused millions of men to revolt against desire and pain. Its dying\nechoes have reached this far, across centuries and oceans, to the\noldest sea in the world. They still reverberate dully against the\ncompact cli\u0000s of Oran. Everybody in this country follows this\nadvice without knowing it. Of course, it is almost futile.\nNothingness cannot be achieved any more than the absolute can.\nBut since we receive as favors the eternal signs brought us by roses\nor by human su\u0000ering, let us not refuse either the rare invitations to\nsleep that the earth addresses us. Each has as much truth as the\nother.\nThis, perhaps, is the Ariadne’s thread of this somnambulist and\nfrantic city. Here one learns the virtues, provisional to be sure, of a\ncertain kind of boredom. In order to be spared, one must say “yes”\n\f\nto the Minotaur. This is an old and fecund wisdom. Above the sea,\nsilent at the base of the red cli\u0000s, it is enough to maintain a delicate\nequilibrium halfway between the two massive headlands which, on\nthe right and left, dip into the clear water. In the pu\u0000ng of a coast-\nguard vessel crawling along the water far out bathed in radiant\nlight, is distinctly heard the mu\u0000ed call of inhuman and glittering\nforces: it is the Minotaur’s farewell.\nIt is noon; the very day is being weighed in the balance. His rite\naccomplished, the traveler receives the reward of his liberation: the\nlittle stone, dry and smooth as an asphodel, that he picks up on the\ncli\u0000. For the initiate the world is no heavier to bear than this stone.\nAtlas’s task is easy; it is su\u0000cient to choose one’s hour. Then one\nrealizes that for an hour, a month, a year, these shores can indulge\nin freedom. They welcome pell-mell, without even looking at them,\nthe monk, the civil servant, or the conqueror. There are days when I\nexpected to meet, in the streets of Oran, Descartes or Cesare Borgia.\nThat did not happen. But perhaps another will be more fortunate. A\ngreat deed, a great work, virile meditation used to call for the\nsolitude of sands or of the convent. There were kept the spiritual\nvigils of arms. Where could they be better celebrated now than in\nthe emptiness of a big city established for some time in\nunintellectual beauty?\nHere is the little stone, smooth as an asphodel. It is at the\nbeginning of everything. Flowers, tears (if you insist), departures,\nand struggles are for tomorrow. In the middle of the day when the\nsky opens its fountains of light in the vast, sonorous space, all the\nheadlands of the coast look like a \u0000eet about to set out. Those\nheavy galleons of rock and light are trembling on their keels as if\nthey were preparing to steer for sunlit isles. O mornings in the\ncountry of Oran! From the high plateaus the swallows plunge into\nhuge troughs where the air is seething. The whole coast is ready for\ndeparture; a shiver of adventure ripples through it. Tomorrow,\nperhaps, we shall leave together.\n(1939)"

    "raw_text": "T\n \nHE MEDITERRANEAN sun has something tragic about it, quite\ndi\u0000erent from the tragedy of fogs. Certain evenings at the\nbase of the seaside mountains, night falls over the \u0000awless curve of\na little bay, and there rises from the silent waters a sense of\nanguished ful\u0000llment. In such spots one can understand that if the\nGreeks knew despair, they always did so through beauty and its\nsti\u0000ing quality. In that gilded calamity, tragedy reaches its highest\npoint. Our time, on the other hand, has fed its despair on ugliness\nand convulsions. This is why Europe would be vile, if su\u0000ering\ncould ever be so.\nWe have exiled beauty; the Greeks took up arms for her. First\ndi\u0000erence, but one that has a history. Greek thought always took\nrefuge behind the conception of limits. It never carried anything to\nextremes, neither the sacred nor reason, because it negated nothing,\nneither the sacred nor reason. It took everything into consideration,\nbalancing shadow with light. Our Europe, on the other hand, o\u0000 in\nthe pursuit of totality, is the child of disproportion. She negates\nbeauty, as she negates whatever she does not glorify. And, through\nall her diverse ways, she glori\u0000es but one thing, which is the future\nrule of reason. In her madness she extends the eternal limits, and at\nthat very moment dark Erinyes fall upon her and tear her to pieces.\nNemesis, the goddess of measure and not of revenge, keeps watch.\nAll those who overstep the limit are pitilessly punished by her.\nThe Greeks, who for centuries questioned themselves as to what\nis just, could understand nothing of our idea of justice. For them\nequity implied a limit, whereas our whole continent is convulsed in\nits search for a justice that must be total. At the dawn of Greek\nthought Heraclitus was already imagining that justice sets limits for\nthe physical universe itself : “The sun will not overstep his\nmeasures; if he does, the Erinyes, the handmaids of justice, will \u0000nd\nhim out.”1 We who have cast the universe and spirit out of our\nsphere laugh at that threat. In a drunken sky we light up the suns\n\f\nwe want. But nonetheless the boundaries exist, and we know it. In\nour wildest aberrations we dream of an equilibrium we have left\nbehind, which we naïvely expect to \u0000nd at the end of our errors.\nChildish presumption which justi\u0000es the fact that child-nations,\ninheriting our follies, are now directing our history.\nA fragment attributed to the same Heraclitus simply states:\n“Presumption, regression of progress.” And, many centuries after\nthe man of Ephesus, Socrates, facing the threat of being condemned\nto death, acknowledged only this one superiority in himself: what\nhe did not know he did not claim to know. The most exemplary life\nand thought of those centuries close on a proud confession of\nignorance. Forgetting that, we have forgotten our virility. We have\npreferred the power that apes greatness, \u0000rst Alexander and then\nthe Roman conquerors whom the authors of our schoolbooks,\nthrough some incomparable vulgarity, teach us to admire. We, too,\nhave conquered, moved boundaries, mastered heaven and earth.\nOur reason has driven all away. Alone at last, we end up by ruling\nover a desert. What imagination could we have left for that higher\nequilibrium in which nature balanced history, beauty, virtue, and\nwhich applied the music of numbers even to blood-tragedy? We\nturn our backs on nature; we are ashamed of beauty. Our wretched\ntragedies have a smell of the o\u0000ce clinging to them, and the blood\nthat trickles from them is the color of printer’s ink.\nThis is why it is improper to proclaim today that we are the sons\nof Greece. Or else we are the renegade sons. Placing history on the\nthrone of God, we are progressing toward theocracy like those\nwhom the Greeks called Barbarians and whom they fought to death\nin the waters of Salamis. In order to realize how we di\u0000er, one must\nturn to him among our philosophers who is the true rival of Plato.\n“Only the modern city,” Hegel dares write, “o\u0000ers the mind a \u0000eld\nin which it can become aware of itself.” We are thus living in the\nperiod of big cities. Deliberately, the world has been amputated of\nall that constitutes its permanence: nature, the sea, hilltops, evening\nmeditation. Consciousness is to be found only in the streets, because\nhistory is to be found only in the streets—this is the edict. And\nconsequently our most signi\u0000cant works show the same bias.\n\f\nLandscapes are not to be found in great European literature since\nDostoevsky. History explains neither the natural universe that\nexisted before it nor the beauty that exists above it. Hence it chose\nto be ignorant of them. Whereas Plato contained everything—\nnonsense, reason, and myth—our philosophers contain nothing but\nnonsense or reason because they have closed their eyes to the rest.\nThe mole is meditating.\nIt is Christianity that began substituting the tragedy of the soul\nfor contemplation of the world. But, at least, Christianity referred\nto a spiritual nature and thereby preserved a certain \u0000xity. With\nGod dead, there remains only history and power. For some time the\nentire e\u0000ort of our philosophers has aimed solely at replacing the\nnotion of human nature with that of situation, and replacing ancient\nharmony with the disorderly advance of chance or reason’s pitiless\nprogress. Whereas the Greeks gave to will the boundaries of reason,\nwe have come to put the will’s impulse in the very center of reason,\nwhich has, as a result, become deadly. For the Greeks, values pre-\nexisted all action, of which they de\u0000nitely set the limits. Modern\nphilosophy places its values at the end of action. They are not but\nare becoming, and we shall know them fully only at the completion\nof history. With values, all limit disappears, and since conceptions\ndi\u0000er as to what they will be, since all struggles, without the brake\nof those same values, spread inde\u0000nitely, today’s Messianisms\nconfront one another and their clamors mingle in the clash of\nempires. Disproportion is a con\u0000agration, according to Heraclitus.\nThe con\u0000agration is spreading; Nietzsche is outdistanced. Europe no\nlonger philosophizes by striking a hammer, but by shooting a\ncannon.\nNature is still there, however. She contrasts her calm skies and\nher reasons with the madness of men. Until the atom too catches\n\u0000re and history ends in the triumph of reason and the agony of the\nspecies. But the Greeks never said that the limit could not be\noverstepped. They said it existed and that whoever dared to exceed\nit was mercilessly struck down. Nothing in present history can\ncontradict them.\n\f\nThe historical spirit and the artist both want to remake the world.\nBut the artist, through an obligation of his nature, knows his limits,\nwhich the historical spirit fails to recognize. This is why the latter’s\naim is tyranny whereas the former’s passion is freedom. All those\nwho are struggling for freedom today are ultimately \u0000ghting for\nbeauty. Of course, it is not a question of defending beauty for itself.\nBeauty cannot do without man, and we shall not give our era its\nnobility and serenity unless we follow it in its misfortune. Never\nagain shall we be hermits. But it is no less true that man cannot do\nwithout beauty, and this is what our era pretends to want to\ndisregard. It steels itself to attain the absolute and authority; it\nwants to trans\u0000gure the world before having exhausted it, to set it\nto rights before having understood it. Whatever it may say, our era\nis deserting this world. Ulysses can choose at Calypso’s bidding\nbetween immortality and the land of his fathers. He chooses the\nland, and death with it. Such simple nobility is foreign to us today.\nOthers will say that we lack humility; but, all things considered, this\nword is ambiguous. Like Dostoevsky’s fools who boast of\neverything, soar to heaven, and end up \u0000aunting their shame in any\npublic place, we merely lack man’s pride, which is \u0000delity to his\nlimits, lucid love of his condition.\n“I hate my time,” Saint-Exupéry wrote shortly before his death,\nfor reasons not far removed from those I have spoken of. But,\nhowever upsetting that exclamation, coming from him who loved\nmen for their admirable qualities, we shall not accept responsibility\nfor it. Yet what a temptation, at certain moments, to turn one’s back\non this bleak, \u0000eshless world! But this time is ours, and we cannot\nlive hating ourselves. It has fallen so low only through the excess of\nits virtues as well as through the extent of its vices. We shall \u0000ght\nfor the virtue that has a history. What virtue? The horses of\nPatroclus weep for their master killed in battle. All is lost. But\nAchilles resumes the \u0000ght, and victory is the outcome, because\nfriendship has just been assassinated: friendship is a virtue.\nAdmission of ignorance, rejection of fanaticism, the limits of the\nworld and of man, the beloved face, and \u0000nally beauty—this is\nwhere we shall be on the side of the Greeks. In a certain sense, the\n\f\ndirection history will take is not the one we think. It lies in the\nstruggle between creation and inquisition. Despite the price which\nartists will pay for their empty hands, we may hope for their\nvictory. Once more the philosophy of darkness will break and fade\naway over the dazzling sea. O midday thought, the Trojan war is\nbeing fought far from the battle\u0000elds! Once more the dreadful walls\nof the modern city will fall to deliver up—“soul serene as the\nocean’s calm”—the beauty of Helen.\n(1948)\n1 Bywater’s translation. [Translator’s note.]\n\f\nRETURN TO TIPASA\n\f\nYou have navigated with raging soul far from the paternal home,\npassing beyond the sea’s double rocks, and you now inhabit a foreign\nland.\n—Medea"

    "raw_text": "F\n \nOR FIVE DAYS rain had been falling ceaselessly on Algiers and had\n\u0000nally wet the sea itself. From an apparently inexhaustible\nsky, constant downpours, viscous in their density, streamed down\nupon the gulf. Gray and soft as a huge sponge, the sea rose slowly\nin the ill-de\u0000ned bay. But the surface of the water seemed almost\nmotionless under the steady rain. Only now and then a barely\nperceptible swelling motion would raise above the sea’s surface a\nvague pu\u0000 of smoke that would come to dock in the harbor, under\nan arc of wet boulevards. The city itself, all its white walls dripping,\ngave o\u0000 a di\u0000erent steam that went out to meet the \u0000rst steam.\nWhichever way you turned, you seemed to be breathing water, to\nbe drinking the air.\nIn front of the soaked sea I walked and waited in that December\nAlgiers, which was for me the city of summers. I had \u0000ed Europe’s\nnight, the winter of faces. But the summer city herself had been\nemptied of her laughter and o\u0000ered me only bent and shining backs.\nIn the evening, in the crudely lighted cafés where I took refuge, I\nread my age in faces I recognized without being able to name them.\nI merely knew that they had been young with me and that they\nwere no longer so.\nYet I persisted without very well knowing what I was waiting for,\nunless perhaps the moment to go back to Tipasa. To be sure, it is\nsheer madness, almost always punished, to return to the sites of\none’s youth and try to relive at forty what one loved or keenly\nenjoyed at twenty. But I was forewarned of that madness. Once\nalready I had returned to Tipasa, soon after those war years that\nmarked for me the end of youth. I hoped, I think, to recapture there\na freedom I could not forget. In that spot, indeed, more than twenty\nyears ago, I had spent whole mornings wandering among the ruins,\nbreathing in the wormwood, warming myself against the stones,\ndiscovering little roses, soon plucked of their petals, which outlive\nthe spring. Only at noon, at the hour when the cicadas themselves\n\f\nfell silent as if overcome, I would \u0000ee the greedy glare of an all-\nconsuming light. Sometimes at night I would sleep open-eyed under\na sky dripping with stars. I was alive then. Fifteen years later I\nfound my ruins, a few feet from the \u0000rst waves, I followed the\nstreets of the forgotten walled city through \u0000elds covered with\nbitter trees, and on the slopes overlooking the bay I still caressed\nthe bread-colored columns. But the ruins were now surrounded with\nbarbed wire and could be entered only through certain openings. It\nwas also forbidden, for reasons which it appears that morality\napproves, to walk there at night; by day one encountered an o\u0000cial\nguardian. It just happened, that morning, that it was raining over\nthe whole extent of the ruins.\nDisoriented, walking through the wet, solitary countryside, I tried\nat least to recapture that strength, hitherto always at hand, that\nhelps me to accept what is when once I have admitted that I cannot\nchange it. And I could not, indeed, reverse the course of time and\nrestore to the world the appearance I had loved which had\ndisappeared in a day, long before. The second of September 1939,\nin fact, I had not gone to Greece, as I was to do. War, on the\ncontrary, had come to us, then it had spread over Greece herself.\nThat distance, those years separating the warm ruins from the\nbarbed wire were to be found in me, too, that day as I stood before\nthe sarcophaguses full of black water or under the sodden\ntamarisks. Originally brought up surrounded by beauty which was\nmy only wealth, I had begun in plenty. Then had come the barbed\nwire—I mean tyrannies, war, police forces, the era of revolt. One\nhad had to put oneself right with the authorities of night: the day’s\nbeauty was but a memory. And in this muddy Tipasa the memory\nitself was becoming dim. It was indeed a question of beauty, plenty,\nor youth! In the light from con\u0000agrations the world had suddenly\nshown its wrinkles and its wounds, old and new. It had aged all at\nonce, and we with it. I had come here looking for a certain “lift”;\nbut I realized that it inspires only the man who is unaware that he is\nabout to launch forward. No love without a little innocence. Where\nwas the innocence? Empires were tumbling down; nations and men\nwere tearing at one another’s throats; our hands were soiled.\n\f\nOriginally innocent without knowing it, we were now guilty\nwithout meaning to be: the mystery was increasing with our\nknowledge. This is why, O mockery, we were concerned with\nmorality. Weak and disabled, I was dreaming of virtue! In the days\nof innocence I didn’t even know that morality existed. I knew it\nnow, and I was not capable of living up to its standard. On the\npromontory that I used to love, among the wet columns of the\nruined temple, I seemed to be walking behind someone whose steps\nI could still hear on the stone slabs and mosaics but whom I should\nnever again overtake. I went back to Paris and remained several\nyears before returning home.\nYet I obscurely missed something during all those years. When\none has once had the good luck to love intensely, life is spent in\ntrying to recapture that ardor and that illumination. Forsaking\nbeauty and the sensual happiness attached to it, exclusively serving\nmisfortune, calls for a nobility I lack. But, after all, nothing is true\nthat forces one to exclude. Isolated beauty ends up simpering;\nsolitary justice ends up oppressing. Whoever aims to serve one\nexclusive of the other serves no one, not even himself, and\neventually serves injustice twice. A day comes when, thanks to\nrigidity, nothing causes wonder any more, everything is known, and\nlife is spent in beginning over again. These are the days of exile, of\ndesiccated life, of dead souls. To come alive again, one needs a\nspecial grace, self-forgetfulness, or a homeland. Certain mornings,\non turning a corner, a delightful dew falls on the heart and then\nevaporates. But its coolness remains, and this is what the heart\nrequires always. I had to set out again.\nAnd in Algiers a second time, still walking under the same\ndownpour which seemed not to have ceased since a departure I had\nthought de\u0000nitive, amid the same vast melancholy smelling of rain\nand sea, despite this misty sky, these backs \u0000eeing under the\nshower, these cafés whose sulphureous light distorted faces, I\npersisted in hoping. Didn’t I know, besides, that Algiers rains,\ndespite their appearance of never meaning to end, nonetheless stop\nin an instant, like those streams in my country which rise in two\nhours, lay waste acres of land, and suddenly dry up? One evening,\n\f\nin fact, the rain ceased. I waited one night more. A limpid morning\nrose, dazzling, over the pure sea. From the sky, fresh as a daisy,\nwashed over and over again by the rains, reduced by these repeated\nwashings to its \u0000nest and clearest texture, emanated a vibrant light\nthat gave to each house and each tree a sharp outline, an astonished\nnewness. In the world’s morning the earth must have sprung forth\nin such a light. I again took the road for Tipasa.\nFor me there is not a single one of those sixty-nine kilometers\nthat is not \u0000lled with memories and sensations. Turbulent\nchildhood, adolescent daydreams in the drone of the bus’s motor,\nmornings, unspoiled girls, beaches, young muscles always at the\npeak of their e\u0000ort, evening’s slight anxiety in a sixteen-year-old\nheart, lust for life, fame, and ever the same sky throughout the\nyears, unfailing in strength and light, itself insatiable, consuming\none by one over a period of months the victims stretched out in the\nform of crosses on the beach at the deathlike hour of noon. Always\nthe same sea, too, almost impalpable in the morning light, which I\nagain saw on the horizon as soon as the road, leaving the Sahel and\nits bronze-colored vineyards, sloped down toward the coast. But I\ndid not stop to look at it. I wanted to see again the Chenoua, that\nsolid, heavy mountain cut out of a single block of stone, which\nborders the bay of Tipasa to the west before dropping down into the\nsea itself. It is seen from a distance, long before arriving, a light,\nblue haze still confused with the sky. But gradually it is condensed,\nas you advance toward it, until it takes on the color of the\nsurrounding waters, a huge motionless wave whose amazing leap\nupward has been brutally solidi\u0000ed above the sea calmed all at\nonce. Still nearer, almost at the gates of Tipasa, here is its frowning\nbulk, brown and green, here is the old mossy god that nothing will\never shake, a refuge and harbor for its sons, of whom I am one.\nWhile watching it I \u0000nally got through the barbed wire and found\nmyself among the ruins. And under the glorious December light, as\nhappens but once or twice in lives which ever after can consider\nthemselves favored to the full, I found exactly what I had come\nseeking, what, despite the era and the world, was o\u0000ered me, truly\nto me alone, in that forsaken nature. From the forum strewn with\n\f\nolives could be seen the village down below. No sound came from\nit; wisps of smoke rose in the limpid air. The sea likewise was silent\nas if smothered under the unbroken shower of dazzling, cold light.\nFrom the Chenoua a distant cock’s crow alone celebrated the day’s\nfragile glory. In the direction of the ruins, as far as the eye could\nsee, there was nothing but pock-marked stones and wormwood,\ntrees and perfect columns in the transparence of the crystalline air.\nIt seemed as if the morning were stabilized, the sun stopped for an\nincalculable moment. In this light and this silence, years of wrath\nand night melted slowly away. I listened to an almost forgotten\nsound within myself as if my heart, long stopped, were calmly\nbeginning to beat again. And awake now, I recognized one by one\nthe imperceptible sounds of which the silence was made up: the\n\u0000gured bass of the birds, the sea’s faint, brief sighs at the foot of the\nrocks, the vibration of the trees, the blind singing of the columns,\nthe rustling of the wormwood plants, the furtive lizards. I heard\nthat; I also listened to the happy torrents rising within me. It\nseemed to me that I had at last come to harbor, for a moment at\nleast, and that henceforth that moment would be endless. But soon\nafter, the sun rose visibly a degree in the sky. A magpie preluded\nbrie\u0000y, and at once, from all directions, birds’ songs burst out with\nenergy, jubilation, joyful discordance, and in\u0000nite rapture. The day\nstarted up again. It was to carry me to evening.\nAt noon on the half-sandy slopes covered with heliotropes like a\nfoam left by the furious waves of the last few days as they\nwithdrew, I watched the sea barely swelling at that hour with an\nexhausted motion, and I satis\u0000ed the two thirsts one cannot long\nneglect without drying up—I mean loving and admiring. For there\nis merely bad luck in not being loved; there is misfortune in not\nloving. All of us, today, are dying of this misfortune. For violence\nand hatred dry up the heart itself; the long \u0000ght for justice exhausts\nthe love that nevertheless gave birth to it. In the clamor in which\nwe live, love is impossible and justice does not su\u0000ce. This is why\nEurope hates daylight and is only able to set injustice up against\ninjustice. But in order to keep justice from shriveling up like a\nbeautiful orange fruit containing nothing but a bitter, dry pulp, I\n\f\ndiscovered once more at Tipasa that one must keep intact in oneself\na freshness, a cool wellspring of joy, love the day that escapes\ninjustice, and return to combat having won that light. Here I\nrecaptured the former beauty, a young sky, and I measured my\nluck, realizing at last that in the worst years of our madness the\nmemory of that sky had never left me. This was what in the end had\nkept me from despairing. I had always known that the ruins of\nTipasa were younger than our new constructions or our bomb\ndamage. There the world began over again every day in an ever\nnew light. O light! This is the cry of all the characters of ancient\ndrama brought face to face with their fate. This last resort was ours,\ntoo, and I knew it now. In the middle of winter I at last discovered\nthat there was in me an invincible summer.\n* * *\nI have again left Tipasa; I have returned to Europe and its\nstruggles. But the memory of that day still uplifts me and helps me\nto welcome equally what delights and what crushes. In the di\u0000cult\nhour we are living, what else can I desire than to exclude nothing\nand to learn how to braid with white thread and black thread a\nsingle cord stretched to the breaking-point? In everything I have\ndone or said up to now, I seem to recognize these two forces, even\nwhen they work at cross-purposes. I have not been able to disown\nthe light into which I was born and yet I have not wanted to reject\nthe servitudes of this time. It would be too easy to contrast here\nwith the sweet name of Tipasa other more sonorous and crueler\nnames. For men of today there is an inner way, which I know well\nfrom having taken it in both directions, leading from the spiritual\nhilltops to the capitals of crime. And doubtless one can always rest,\nfall asleep on the hilltop or board with crime. But if one forgoes a\npart of what is, one must forgo being oneself; one must forgo living\nor loving otherwise than by proxy. There is thus a will to live\nwithout rejecting anything of life, which is the virtue I honor most\nin this world. From time to time, at least, it is true that I should like\nto have practiced it. Inasmuch as few epochs require as much as\n\f\nours that one should be equal to the best as to the worst, I should\nlike, indeed, to shirk nothing and to keep faithfully a double\nmemory. Yes, there is beauty and there are the humiliated.\nWhatever may be the di\u0000culties of the undertaking, I should like\nnever to be unfaithful either to one or to the others.\nBut this still resembles a moral code, and we live for something\nthat goes farther than morality. If we could only name it, what\nsilence! On the hill of Sainte-Salsa, to the east of Tipasa, the evening\nis inhabited. It is still light, to tell the truth, but in this light an\nalmost invisible fading announces the day’s end. A wind rises,\nyoung like the night, and suddenly the waveless sea chooses a\ndirection and \u0000ows like a great barren river from one end of the\nhorizon to the other. The sky darkens. Then begins the mystery, the\ngods of night, the beyond-pleasure. But how to translate this? The\nlittle coin I am carrying away from here has a visible surface, a\nwoman’s beautiful face which repeats to me all I have learned in\nthis day, and a worn surface which I feel under my \u0000ngers during\nthe return. What can that lipless mouth be saying, except what I am\ntold by another mysterious voice, within me, which every day\ninforms me of my ignorance and my happiness:\n“The secret I am seeking lies hidden in a valley full of olive trees,\nunder the grass and the cold violets, around an old house that smells\nof wood smoke. For more than twenty years I rambled over that\nvalley and others resembling it, I questioned mute goatherds, I\nknocked at the door of deserted ruins. Occasionally, at the moment\nof the \u0000rst star in the still bright sky, under a shower of shimmering\nlight, I thought I knew. I did know, in truth. I still know, perhaps.\nBut no one wants any of this secret; I don’t want any myself,\ndoubtless; and I cannot stand apart from my people. I live in my\nfamily, which thinks it rules over rich and hideous cities built of\nstones and mists. Day and night it speaks up, and everything bows\nbefore it, which bows before nothing: it is deaf to all secrets. Its\npower that carries me bores me, nevertheless, and on occasion its\nshouts weary me. But its misfortune is mine, and we are of the same\nblood. A cripple, likewise, an accomplice and noisy, have I not\nshouted among the stones? Consequently, I strive to forget, I walk"

As an artist, have you chosen the role of witness?\nHIS would take considerable presumption or a vocation I lack.\nPersonally I don’t ask for any role and I have but one real\nvocation. As a man, I have a preference for happiness; as an artist, it\nseems to me that I still have characters to bring to life without the\nhelp of wars or of law-courts. But I have been sought out, as each\nindividual has been sought out. Artists of the past could at least\nkeep silent in the face of tyranny. The tyrannies of today are\nimproved; they no longer admit of silence or neutrality. One has to\ntake a stand, be either for or against. Well, in that case, I am\nagainst.\nBut this does not amount to choosing the comfortable role of\nwitness. It is merely accepting the time as it is, minding one’s own\nbusiness, in short. Moreover, you are forgetting that today judges,\naccused, and witnesses exchange positions with exemplary rapidity.\nMy choice, if you think I am making one, would at least be never to\nsit on a judge’s bench, or beneath it, like so many of our\nphilosophers. Aside from that, there is no dearth of opportunities\nfor action, in the relative. Trade-unionism is today the \u0000rst, and the\nmost fruitful among them.\nII. Is not the quixotism that has been criticized in your recent works an\nidealistic and romantic de\u0000nition of the artist’s role?\nHowever words are perverted, they provisionally keep their\nmeaning. And it is clear to me that the romantic is the one who\nchooses the perpetual motion of history, the grandiose epic, and the\nannouncement of a miraculous event at the end of time. If I have\ntried to de\u0000ne something, it is, on the contrary, simply the common\nexistence of history and of man, everyday life with the most"

To tell the truth, far from being romantic, I believe\nin the necessity of a rule and an order. I merely say that there can\nbe no question of just any rule whatsoever. And that it would be\nsurprising if the rule we need were given us by this disordered\nsociety, or, on the other hand, by those doctrinaires who declare\nthemselves liberated from all rules and all scruples.\nIII. The Marxists and their followers likewise think they are humanists.\nBut for them human nature will be formed in the classless society of the\nfuture.\nTo begin with, this proves that they reject at the present moment\nwhat we all are: those humanists are accusers of man. How can we\nbe surprised that such a claim should have developed in the world\nof court trials? They reject the man of today in the name of the man\nof the future. That claim is religious in nature. Why should it be\nmore justi\u0000ed than the one which announces the kingdom of heaven\nto come? In reality the end of history cannot have, within the limits\nof our condition, any de\u0000nable signi\u0000cance. It can only be the\nobject of a faith and of a new mysti\u0000cation. A mysti\u0000cation that\ntoday is no less great than the one that of old based colonial\noppression on the necessity of saving the souls of in\u0000dels."

    "raw_text": "IV. Is not that what in reality separates you from the intellectuals of the\nleft?\nYou mean that is what separates those intellectuals from the left?\nTraditionally the left has always been at war against injustice,\nobscurantism, and oppression. It always thought that those\nphenomena were interdependent. The idea that obscurantism can\nlead to justice, the national interest to liberty, is quite recent. The\ntruth is that certain intellectuals of the left (not all, fortunately) are\ntoday hypnotized by force and e\u0000cacy as our intellectuals of the\nright were before and during the war. Their attitudes are di\u0000erent,\nbut the act of resignation is the same. The \u0000rst wanted to be\nrealistic nationalists; the second want to be realistic socialists. In the\nend they betray nationalism and socialism alike in the name of a\nrealism henceforth without content and adored as a pure, and\nillusory, technique of e\u0000cacy.\nThis is a temptation that can, after all, be understood. But still,\nhowever the question is looked at, the new position of the people\nwho call themselves, or think themselves, leftists consists in saying:\ncertain oppressions are justi\u0000able because they follow the direction,\nwhich cannot be justi\u0000ed, of history. Hence there are presumably\nprivileged executioners, and privileged by nothing. This is about\nwhat was said in another context by Joseph de Maistre, who has\nnever been taken for an incendiary. But this is a thesis which,\npersonally, I shall always reject. Allow me to set up against it the\ntraditional point of view of what has been hitherto called the left:\nall executioners are of the same family.\nV. What can the artist do in the world of today?\nHe is not asked either to write about co-operatives or, conversely,\nto lull to sleep in himself the su\u0000erings endured by others\nthroughout history. And since you have asked me to speak\npersonally, I am going to do so as simply as I can. Considered as\nartists, we perhaps have no need to interfere in the a\u0000airs of the\n\f\nworld. But considered as men, yes. The miner who is exploited or\nshot down, the slaves in the camps, those in the colonies, the\nlegions of persecuted throughout the world—they need all those\nwho can speak to communicate their silence and to keep in touch\nwith them. I have not written, day after day, \u0000ghting articles and\ntexts, I have not taken part in the common struggles because I\ndesire the world to be covered with Greek statues and masterpieces.\nThe man who has such a desire does exist in me. Except that he has\nsomething better to do in trying to instill life into the creatures of\nhis imagination. But from my \u0000rst articles to my latest book I have\nwritten so much, and perhaps too much, only because I cannot keep\nfrom being drawn toward everyday life, toward those, whoever\nthey may be, who are humiliated and debased. They need to hope,\nand if all keep silent or if they are given a choice between two\nkinds of humiliation, they will be forever deprived of hope and we\nwith them. It seems to me impossible to endure that idea, nor can\nhe who cannot endure it lie down to sleep in his tower. Not through\nvirtue, as you see, but through a sort of almost organic intolerance,\nwhich you feel or do not feel. Indeed, I see many who fail to feel it,\nbut I cannot envy their sleep.\nThis does not mean, however, that we must sacri\u0000ce our artist’s\nnature to some social preaching or other. I have said elsewhere why\nthe artist was more than ever necessary. But if we intervene as men,\nthat experience will have an e\u0000ect upon our language. And if we are\nnot artists in our language \u0000rst of all, what sort of artists are we?\nEven if, militants in our lives, we speak in our works of deserts and\nof sel\u0000sh love, the mere fact that our lives are militant causes a\nspecial tone of voice to people with men that desert and that love. I\nshall certainly not choose the moment when we are beginning to\nleave nihilism behind to stupidly deny the values of creation in\nfavor of the values of humanity, or vice versa. In my mind neither\none is ever separated from the other and I measure the greatness of\nan artist (Molière, Tolstoy, Melville) by the balance he managed to\nmaintain between the two. Today, under the pressure of events, we\nare obliged to transport that tension into our lives likewise. This is\nwhy so many artists, bending under the burden, take refuge in the\n\f\nivory tower or, conversely, in the social church. But as for me, I see\nin both choices a like act of resignation. We must simultaneously\nserve su\u0000ering and beauty. The long patience, the strength, the\nsecret cunning such service calls for are the virtues that establish\nthe very renascence we need.\nOne word more. This undertaking, I know, cannot be\naccomplished without dangers and bitterness. We must accept the\ndangers: the era of chairbound artists is over. But we must reject\nthe bitterness. One of the temptations of the artist is to believe\nhimself solitary, and in truth he hears this shouted at him with a\ncertain base delight. But this is not true. He stands in the midst of\nall, in the same rank, neither higher nor lower, with all those who\nare working and struggling. His very vocation, in the face of\noppression, is to open the prisons and to give a voice to the sorrows\nand joys of all. This is where art, against its enemies, justi\u0000es itself\nby proving precisely that it is no one’s enemy. By itself art could\nprobably not produce the renascence which implies justice and\nliberty. But without it, that renascence would be without forms and,\nconsequently, would be nothing. Without culture, and the relative\nfreedom it implies, society, even when perfect, is but a jungle. This\nis why any authentic creation is a gift to the future.\n(1953)\n\f\nBY ALBERT CAMUS\nAwarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1957\nNotebooks 1942–1951 (Carnets,\njanvier 1942–mars 1951) 1965\nNotebooks 1935–1942 (Carnets,\nmai 1935–février 1942) 1963\nResistance, Rebellion, and Death (Actuelles—a selection) 1961\nThe Possessed (Les Possédés) 1960\nCaligula and Three Other Plays (Caligula,\nLe Malentendu, L’Etat de siège,\nLes Justes) 1958\nExile and the Kingdom (L’Exil\net le Royaume) 1958\nThe Fall (La Chute) 1957\nThe Myth of Sisyphus (Le Mythe de Sisyphe)\nand Other Essays 1955\nThe Rebel (L’Homme Révolté) 1954\nThe Plague (La Peste) 1948\nThe Stranger (L’Etranger) 1946"

    "raw_text": "ALBERT CAMUS\nALBERT CAMUS was born in Algeria in 1913. He spent the early years of\nhis life in North Africa, where he became a journalist, and from\n1935 to 1938 he ran the Théâtre de l’Équipe, a company that\nproduced plays by Malraux, Gide, Synge, Dostoyevsky, and others.\nDuring World War II he was one of the leading writers of the\nFrench Resistance and editor of Combat, an underground newspaper\nhe helped found. His \u0000ction, including The Stranger, The Plague, The\nFall, and Exile and the Kingdom; his philosophical essays, The Myth of\nSisyphus and The Rebel; and his plays have assured his preeminent\nposition in modern letters. In 1957, Camus was awarded the Nobel\nPrize for Literature. Upon his untimely death in a road accident in\n1960, Jean-Paul Sartre wrote, “Camus could never cease to be one\nof the principal forces in our cultural domain, nor to represent, in\nhis own way, the history of France and this century.”\n\f\nALSO BY\nAlbert Camus\nWinner of the Nobel Prize for Literature\nTHE FIRST MAN\nIn The First Man Albert Camus tells the story of Jacques Cormery, a boy who lived\na life much like Camus’ own. Camus summons up the sights, sounds, and textures\nof a childhood circumscribed by poverty and a father’s death yet redeemed by the\naustere beauty of Algeria and the boy’s attachment to his nearly deaf-mute\nmother. The result is a moving journey through the lost landscape of youth that\nalso discloses the wellsprings of Camus’ aesthetic powers and moral vision.\nPublished thirty-\u0000ve years after its discovery amid the wreckage of the car\naccident that killed its author, The First Man is the brilliant consummation of the\nlife and work of one of the twentieth century’s greatest novelists.\nFiction/Literature\nEXILE AND THE KINGDOM\nFrom a variety of masterfully rendered perspectives, these six stories depict people\nat painful odds with the world around them. A wife can only surrender to a desert\nnight by betraying her husband. An artist struggles to honor his own aspirations\nas well as society’s expectations of him. A missionary brutally converted to the\nworship of a tribal fetish is left with but an echo of his identity. Whether set in\nNorth Africa, Paris, or Brazil, the stories in Exile and the Kingdom are probing\nportraits of spiritual exile and man’s perpetual search for an inner kingdom in\nwhich to be reborn. They display Camus at the height of his powers.\nFiction/Literature\nTHE FALL\nMordant, brilliant, elegantly styled, The Fall is a novel of the conscience of modern\nman in the face of evil. In a seedy bar in Amsterdam, Clamence, an expatriate\nFrenchman, indulges in a calculated confession. He recalls his past life as a\nrespected Parisian lawyer, a champion of noble causes, and, privately, a libertine\n—yet one apparently immune to judgment. As his narrative unfolds, ambiguities"

    "raw_text": "amass; every triumph reveals a failure, every motive a hidden treachery. The irony\nof his recital anticipates his downfall—and implicates us all.\nFiction/Literature\nA HAPPY DEATH\nIn his \u0000rst novel, A Happy Death, written when he was in his early twenties and\nretrieved from his private papers following his death in 1960, Albert Camus laid\nthe foundation for the The Stranger, focusing in both works on an Algerian clerk\nwho kills a man in cold blood. But he also revealed himself to an extent that he\nnever did in his later \u0000ction. For if A Happy Death is the study of a rule-bound\nbeing shattering the fetters of his existence, it is also a remarkably candid portrait\nof its author as a young man.\nFiction/Literature\nTHE MYTH OF SISYPHUS AND OTHER ESSAYS\nOne of the most in\u0000uential works of this century, The Myth of Sisyphus and Other\nEssays is a crucial exposition of existential thought. In\u0000uenced by works such as\nDon Juan and the novels of Kafka, these essays begin with a meditation on suicide:\nthe question of living or not living in a universe devoid of order or meaning. With\nlyric eloquence, Albert Camus brilliantly posits a way out of despair, rea\u0000rming\nthe value of personal existence, and the possibility of life lived with dignity and\nauthenticity.\nNon\u0000ction/Literature\nTHE PLAGUE\nA gripping tale of unrelieved horror, of survival and resilience, and of the ways in\nwhich humankind confronts death, The Plague is at once a masterfully crafted\nnovel, eloquently understated and epic in scope, and a parable of ageless moral\nresonance profoundly relevant to our times. In Oran, a coastal town in North\nAfrica, the plague begins as a series of portents, unheeded by the people. It\ngradually becomes an omnipresent reality, obliterating all traces of the past and\ndriving its victims to almost unearthly extremes of su\u0000ering, madness, and\ncompassion.\nFiction/Literature\nTHE REBEL\n\f\nFor Albert Camus, the urge to revolt is one of the “essential dimensions” of human\nnature, manifested in man’s timeless Promethean struggle against the conditions\nof his existence, as well as the popular uprisings against established orders\nthroughout history. And yet, with an eye toward the French Revolution and its\nregicides and deicides, he shows how inevitably the course of revolution leads to\ntyranny. As old regimes throughout the world collapse, The Rebel resonates as an\nardent, eloquent, and supremely rational voice of conscience for our tumultuous\ntimes.\nNon\u0000ction/Literature\nRESISTANCE, REBELLION, AND DEATH\nResistance, Rebellion, and Death displays Camus’ rigorous moral intelligence\naddressing issues that range from colonial warfare in Algeria to the social cancer\nof capital punishment. But this stirring book is above all a re\u0000ection on the\nproblem of freedom, and, as such, belongs in the same tradition as the works that\ngave Camus his reputation as the conscience of our century: The Stranger, The\nRebel, and The Myth of Sisyphus.\nFiction/Literature\nAvailable wherever books are sold.\nwww.randomhouse.com"
