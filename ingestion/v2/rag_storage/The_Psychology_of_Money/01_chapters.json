He was a genius,having designed and patented a key component in Wi-Fi routers inhis 20s. He had started and sold several companies. He was wildlysuccessful.\nHe also had a relationship with money I’d describe as a mix ofinsecurity and childish stupidity.\nHe carried a stack of hundred dollar bills several inches thick. Heshowed it to everyone who wanted to see it and many who didn’t.He bragged openly and loudly about his wealth, often while drunkand always apropos of nothing.\nOne day he handed one of my colleagues several thousand dollars ofcash and said, “Go to the jewelry store down the street and get me afew $1,000 gold coins.”"

    "raw_text": "An hour later, gold coins in hand, the tech executive and his buddiesgathered around by a dock overlooking the Pacific Ocean. They thenproceeded to throw the coins into the sea, skipping them like rocks,cackling as they argued whose went furthest. Just for fun.\nDays later he shattered a lamp in the hotel’s restaurant. A managertold him it was a $500 lamp and he’d have to replace it.\n“You want five hundred dollars?” the executive asked incredulously,while pulling a brick of cash from his pocket and handing it to themanager. “Here’s five thousand dollars. Now get out of my face.And don’t ever insult me like that again.”\nYou may wonder how long this behavior could last, and the answerwas “not long.” I learned years later that he went broke.\nThe premise of this book is that doing well with money has a little todo with how smart you are and a lot to do with how you behave.And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people.\nA genius who loses control of their emotions can be a financialdisaster. The opposite is also true. Ordinary folks with no financialeducation can be wealthy if they have a handful of behavioral skillsthat have nothing to do with formal measures of intelligence.\n \n \nMy favorite Wikipedia entry begins: “Ronald James Read was anAmerican philanthropist, investor, janitor, and gas station attendant.”\nRonald Read was born in rural Vermont. He was the first person inhis family to graduate high school, made all the more impressive bythe fact that he hitchhiked to campus each day.\nFor those who knew Ronald Read, there wasn’t much else worthmentioning. His life was about as low key as they come.\nRead fixed cars at a gas station for 25 years and swept floors atJCPenney for 17 years. He bought a two-bedroom house for $12,000at age 38 and lived there for the rest of his life. He was widowed atage 50 and never remarried. A friend recalled that his main hobbywas chopping firewood.\nRead died in 2014, age 92. Which is when the humble rural janitormade international headlines.\n2,813,503 Americans died in 2014. Fewer than 4,000 of them had anet worth of over $8 million when they passed away. Ronald Read\n\f\nwas one of them.\nIn his will the former janitor left $2 million to his stepkids and morethan $6 million to his local hospital and library.\nThose who knew Read were baffled. Where did he get all thatmoney?\nIt turned out there was no secret. There was no lottery win and noinheritance. Read saved what little he could and invested it in bluechip stocks. Then he waited, for decades on end, as tiny savingscompounded into more than $8 million.\nThat’s it. From janitor to philanthropist.\nA few months before Ronald Read died, another man namedRichard was in the news.\nRichard Fuscone was everything Ronald Read was not. A Harvard-educated Merrill Lynch executive with an MBA, Fuscone had such asuccessful career in finance that he retired in his 40s to become aphilanthropist. Former Merrill CEO David Komansky praisedFuscone’s “business savvy, leadership skills, sound judgment andpersonal integrity.”¹ Crain’s business magazine once included him ina “40 under 40” list of successful businesspeople.²\nBut then—like the gold-coin-skipping tech executive—everythingfell apart.\nIn the mid-2000s Fuscone borrowed heavily to expand an 18,000-square foot home in Greenwich, Connecticut that had 11 bathrooms,two elevators, two pools, seven garages, and cost more than $90,000a month to maintain.\nThen the 2008 financial crisis hit.\nThe crisis hurt virtually everyone’s finances. It apparently turnedFuscone’s into dust. High debt and illiquid assets left him bankrupt.“I currently have no income,” he allegedly told a bankruptcy judgein 2008.\nFirst his Palm Beach house was foreclosed.\nIn 2014 it was the Greenwich mansion’s turn.\nFive months before Ronald Read left his fortune to charity, RichardFuscone’s home—where guests recalled the “thrill of dining anddancing atop a see-through covering on the home’s indoorswimming pool”—was sold in a foreclosure auction for 75% lessthan an insurance company figured it was worth.³"

    "raw_text": "Ronald Read was patient; Richard Fuscone was greedy. That’s all ittook to eclipse the massive education and experience gap betweenthe two.\nThe lesson here is not to be more like Ronald and less like Richard—though that’s not bad advice.\nThe fascinating thing about these stories is how unique they are tofinance.\nIn what other industry does someone with no college degree, notraining, no background, no formal experience, and no connectionsmassively outperform someone with the best education, the besttraining, and the best connections?\nI struggle to think of any.\nIt is impossible to think of a story about Ronald Read performing aheart transplant better than a Harvard-trained surgeon. Or designinga skyscraper superior to the best-trained architects. There will neverbe a story of a janitor outperforming the world’s top nuclearengineers.\nBut these stories do happen in investing.\nThe fact that Ronald Read can coexist with Richard Fuscone has twoexplanations. One, financial outcomes are driven by luck,independent of intelligence and effort. That’s true to some extent,and this book will discuss it in further detail. Or, two (and I thinkmore common), that financial success is not a hard science. It’s asoft skill, where how you behave is more important than what youknow.\nI call this soft skill the psychology of money. The aim of this book isto use short stories to convince you that soft skills are moreimportant than the technical side of money. I’ll do this in a way thatwill help everyone—from Read to Fuscone and everyone in between—make better financial decisions.\nThese soft skills are, I’ve come to realize, greatly underappreciated.\nFinance is overwhelmingly taught as a math-based field, where youput data into a formula and the formula tells you what to do, and it’sassumed that you’ll just go do it.\nThis is true in personal finance, where you’re told to have a six-month emergency fund and save 10% of your salary.\nIt’s true in investing, where we know the exact historical correlationsbetween interest rates and valuations.\n\f\nAnd it’s true in corporate finance, where CFOs can measure theprecise cost of capital.\nIt’s not that any of these things are bad or wrong. It’s that knowingwhat to do tells you nothing about what happens in your head whenyou try to do it.\n \n \nTwo topics impact everyone, whether you are interested in them ornot: health and money.\nThe health care industry is a triumph of modern science, with risinglife expectancy across the world. Scientific discoveries havereplaced doctors’ old ideas about how the human body works, andvirtually everyone is healthier because of it.\nThe money industry—investing, personal finance, business planning—is another story.\nFinance has scooped up the smartest minds coming from topuniversities over the last two decades. Financial Engineering was themost popular major in Princeton’s School of Engineering a decadeago. Is there any evidence it has made us better investors?\nI have seen none.\nThrough collective trial and error over the years we learned how tobecome better farmers, skilled plumbers, and advanced chemists.But has trial and error taught us to become better with our personalfinances? Are we less likely to bury ourselves in debt? More likelyto save for a rainy day? Prepare for retirement? Have realistic viewsabout what money does, and doesn’t do, to our happiness?\nI’ve seen no compelling evidence.\nMost of the reason why, I believe, is that we think about and aretaught about money in ways that are too much like physics (withrules and laws) and not enough like psychology (with emotions andnuance).\nAnd that, to me, is as fascinating as it is important.\nMoney is everywhere, it affects all of us, and confuses most of us.Everyone thinks about it a little differently. It offers lessons onthings that apply to many areas of life, like risk, confidence, andhappiness. Few topics offer a more powerful magnifying glass that"

    "raw_text": "helps explain why people behave the way they do than money. It isone of the greatest shows on Earth.\nMy own appreciation for the psychology of money is shaped bymore than a decade of writing on the topic. I began writing aboutfinance in early 2008. It was the dawn of a financial crisis and theworst recession in 80 years.\nTo write about what was happening, I wanted to figure out what washappening. But the first thing I learned after the financial crisis wasthat no one could accurately explain what happened, or why ithappened, let alone what should be done about it. For every goodexplanation there was an equally convincing rebuttal.\nEngineers can determine the cause of a bridge collapse becausethere’s agreement that if a certain amount of force is applied to acertain area, that area will break. Physics isn’t controversial. It’sguided by laws. Finance is different. It’s guided by people’sbehaviors. And how I behave might make sense to me but look crazyto you.\nThe more I studied and wrote about the financial crisis, the more Irealized that you could understand it better through the lenses ofpsychology and history, not finance.\nTo grasp why people bury themselves in debt you don’t need tostudy interest rates; you need to study the history of greed,insecurity, and optimism. To get why investors sell out at the bottomof a bear market you don’t need to study the math of expected futurereturns; you need to think about the agony of looking at your familyand wondering if your investments are imperiling their future.\nI love Voltaire’s observation that “History never repeats itself; manalways does.” It applies so well to how we behave with money.\nIn 2018, I wrote a report outlining 20 of the most important flaws,biases, and causes of bad behavior I’ve seen affect people whendealing with money. It was called The Psychology of Money, andover one million people have read it. This book is a deeper dive intothe topic. Some short passages from the report appear unaltered inthis book.\nWhat you’re holding is 20 chapters, each describing what I considerto be the most important and often counterintuitive features of thepsychology of money. The chapters revolve around a commontheme, but exist on their own and can be read independently.\n\f\nIt’s not a long book. You’re welcome. Most readers don’t finish thebooks they begin because most single topics don’t require 300 pagesof explanation. I’d rather make 20 short points you finish than onelong one you give up on.\nOn we go.\n\f\n\n\f\nLet me tell you about a problem. It might make you feel better aboutwhat you do with your money, and less judgmental about what otherpeople do with theirs.\nPeople do some crazy things with money. But no one is crazy.\nHere’s the thing: People from different generations, raised bydifferent parents who earned different incomes and held differentvalues, in different parts of the world, born into different economies,experiencing different job markets with different incentives anddifferent degrees of luck, learn very different lessons.\nEveryone has their own unique experience with how the worldworks. And what you’ve experienced is more compelling than whatyou learn second-hand. So all of us—you, me, everyone—gothrough life anchored to a set of views about how money works thatvary wildly from person to person. What seems crazy to you mightmake sense to me.\nThe person who grew up in poverty thinks about risk and reward inways the child of a wealthy banker cannot fathom if he tried.\nThe person who grew up when inflation was high experiencedsomething the person who grew up with stable prices never had to.\nThe stock broker who lost everything during the Great Depressionexperienced something the tech worker basking in the glory of thelate 1990s can’t imagine.\nThe Australian who hasn’t seen a recession in 30 years hasexperienced something no American ever has.\nOn and on. The list of experiences is endless.\nYou know stuff about money that I don’t, and vice versa. You gothrough life with different beliefs, goals, and forecasts, than I do.That’s not because one of us is smarter than the other, or has betterinformation. It’s because we’ve had different lives shaped bydifferent and equally persuasive experiences.\nYour personal experiences with money make up maybe0.00000001% of what’s happened in the world, but maybe 80% ofhow you think the world works. So equally smart people candisagree about how and why recessions happen, how you shouldinvest your money, what you should prioritize, how much risk youshould take, and so on.\nIn his book on 1930s America, Frederick Lewis Allen wrote that theGreat Depression “marked millions of Americans—inwardly—for\n\f\nthe rest of their lives.” But there was a range of experiences.Twenty-five years later, as he was running for president, John F.Kennedy was asked by a reporter what he remembered from theDepression. He remarked:\n \nI have no first-hand knowledge of the Depression. My family hadone of the great fortunes of the world and it was worth more thanever then. We had bigger houses, more servants, we traveled more.About the only thing that I saw directly was when my father hiredsome extra gardeners just to give them a job so they could eat. Ireally did not learn about the Depression until I read about it atHarvard.\n \nThis was a major point in the 1960 election. How, people thought,could someone with no understanding of the biggest economic storyof the last generation be put in charge of the economy? It was, inmany ways, overcome only by JFK’s experience in World War II.That was the other most widespread emotional experience of theprevious generation, and something his primary opponent, HubertHumphrey, didn’t have.\nThe challenge for us is that no amount of studying or open-mindedness can genuinely recreate the power of fear anduncertainty.\nI can read about what it was like to lose everything during the GreatDepression. But I don’t have the emotional scars of those whoactually experienced it. And the person who lived through it can’tfathom why someone like me could come across as complacentabout things like owning stocks. We see the world through adifferent lens.\nSpreadsheets can model the historic frequency of big stock marketdeclines. But they can’t model the feeling of coming home, lookingat your kids, and wondering if you’ve made a mistake that willimpact their lives. Studying history makes you feel like youunderstand something. But until you’ve lived through it andpersonally felt its consequences, you may not understand it enoughto change your behavior.\nWe all think we know how the world works. But we’ve all onlyexperienced a tiny sliver of it.\nAs investor Michael Batnick says, “some lessons have to beexperienced before they can be understood.” We are all victims, in\n\f\ndifferent ways, to that truth.\n \n \nIn 2006 economists Ulrike Malmendier and Stefan Nagel from theNational Bureau of Economic Research dug through 50 years of theSurvey of Consumer Finances—a detailed look at what Americans\ndo with their money. ⁴\nIn theory people should make investment decisions based on theirgoals and the characteristics of the investment options available tothem at the time.\nBut that’s not what people do.\nThe economists found that people’s lifetime investment decisionsare heavily anchored to the experiences those investors had in theirown generation—especially experiences early in their adult life.\nIf you grew up when inflation was high, you invested less of yourmoney in bonds later in life compared to those who grew up wheninflation was low. If you happened to grow up when the stockmarket was strong, you invested more of your money in stocks laterin life compared to those who grew up when stocks were weak.\nThe economists wrote: “Our findings suggest that individualinvestors’ willingness to bear risk depends on personal history.”\nNot intelligence, or education, or sophistication. Just the dumb luckof when and where you were born.\nThe Financial Times interviewed Bill Gross, the famed bondmanager, in 2019. “Gross admits that he would probably not bewhere he is today if he had been born a decade earlier or later,” thepiece said. Gross’s career coincided almost perfectly with agenerational collapse in interest rates that gave bond prices atailwind. That kind of thing doesn’t just affect the opportunities youcome across; it affects what you think about those opportunitieswhen they’re presented to you. To Gross, bonds were wealth-generating machines. To his father’s generation, who grew up withand endured higher inflation, they might be seen as wealthincinerators.\nThe differences in how people have experienced money are notsmall, even among those you might think are pretty similar.\nTake stocks. If you were born in 1970, the S&P 500 increasedalmost 10-fold, adjusted for inflation, during your teens and 20s.\n\f\nThat’s an amazing return. If you were born in 1950, the market wentliterally nowhere in your teens and 20s adjusted for inflation. Twogroups of people, separated by chance of their birth year, go throughlife with a completely different view on how the stock marketworks:\n \n \nOr inflation. If you were born in 1960s America, inflation duringyour teens and 20s—your young, impressionable years when you’redeveloping a base of knowledge about how the economy works—sent prices up more than threefold. That’s a lot. You remember gaslines and getting paychecks that stretched noticeably less far than theones before them. But if you were born in 1990, inflation has beenso low for your whole life that it’s probably never crossed yourmind."

    "raw_text": "America’s nationwide unemployment in November 2009 was around10%. But the unemployment rate for African American males age 16to 19 without a high school diploma was 49%. For Caucasianfemales over age 45 with a college degree, it was 4%.\nLocal stock markets in Germany and Japan were wiped out duringWorld War II. Entire regions were bombed out. At the end of the warGerman farms only produced enough food to provide the country’scitizens with 1,000 calories a day. Compare that to the U.S., wherethe stock market more than doubled from 1941 through the end of1945, and the economy was the strongest it had been in almost twodecades.\nNo one should expect members of these groups to go through therest of their lives thinking the same thing about inflation. Or thestock market. Or unemployment. Or money in general.\nNo one should expect them to respond to financial information thesame way. No one should assume they are influenced by the sameincentives.\n\f\nNo one should expect them to trust the same sources of advice.\nNo one should expect them to agree on what matters, what’s worthit, what’s likely to happen next, and what the best path forward is.\nTheir view of money was formed in different worlds. And whenthat’s the case, a view about money that one group of people thinksis outrageous can make perfect sense to another.\nA few years ago, The New York Times did a story on the workingconditions of Foxconn, the massive Taiwanese electronicsmanufacturer. The conditions are often atrocious. Readers wererightly upset. But a fascinating response to the story came from thenephew of a Chinese worker, who wrote in the comment section:\n \nMy aunt worked several years in what Americans call “sweatshops.” It was hard work. Long hours, “small” wage, “poor”working conditions. Do you know what my aunt did before sheworked in one of these factories? She was a prostitute.\nThe idea of working in a “sweat shop” compared to that old lifestyleis an improvement, in my opinion. I know that my aunt would ratherbe “exploited” by an evil capitalist boss for a couple of dollars thanhave her body be exploited by several men for pennies.\nThat is why I am upset by many Americans’ thinking. We do nothave the same opportunities as the West. Our governmentalinfrastructure is different. The country is different. Yes, factory ishard labor. Could it be better? Yes, but only when you compare suchto American jobs.\n \nI don’t know what to make of this. Part of me wants to argue,fiercely. Part of me wants to understand. But mostly it’s an exampleof how different experiences can lead to vastly different viewswithin topics that one side intuitively thinks should be black andwhite.\nEvery decision people make with money is justified by taking theinformation they have at the moment and plugging it into theirunique mental model of how the world works.\nThose people can be misinformed. They can have incompleteinformation. They can be bad at math. They can be persuaded byrotten marketing. They can have no idea what they’re doing. Theycan misjudge the consequences of their actions. Oh, can they ever.\n\f\nBut every financial decision a person makes, makes sense to them inthat moment and checks the boxes they need to check. They tellthemselves a story about what they’re doing and why they’re doingit, and that story has been shaped by their own unique experiences.\nTake a simple example: lottery tickets.\nAmericans spend more on them than movies, video games, music,sporting events, and books combined.\nAnd who buys them? Mostly poor people.\nThe lowest-income households in the U.S. on average spend $412 ayear on lotto tickets, four times the amount of those in the highestincome groups. Forty percent of Americans cannot come up with$400 in an emergency. Which is to say: Those buying $400 in lotterytickets are by and large the same people who say they couldn’t comeup with $400 in an emergency. They are blowing their safety nets onsomething with a one-in-millions chance of hitting it big.\nThat seems crazy to me. It probably seems crazy to you, too. ButI’m not in the lowest income group. You’re likely not, either. So it’shard for many of us to intuitively grasp the subconscious reasoningof low-income lottery ticket buyers.\nBut strain a little, and you can imagine it going something like this:\n \nWe live paycheck-to-paycheck and saving seems out of reach. Ourprospects for much higher wages seem out of reach. We can’t affordnice vacations, new cars, health insurance, or homes in safeneighborhoods. We can’t put our kids through college withoutcrippling debt. Much of the stuff you people who read finance bookseither have now, or have a good chance of getting, we don’t. Buyinga lottery ticket is the only time in our lives we can hold a tangibledream of getting the good stuff that you already have and take forgranted. We are paying for a dream, and you may not understandthat because you are already living a dream. That’s why we buymore tickets than you do.\n \nYou don’t have to agree with this reasoning. Buying lotto ticketswhen you’re broke is still a bad idea. But I can kind of understandwhy lotto ticket sales persist.\nAnd that idea—“What you’re doing seems crazy but I kind ofunderstand why you’re doing it.”—uncovers the root of many of ourfinancial decisions."

    "raw_text": "Few people make financial decisions purely with a spreadsheet.They make them at the dinner table, or in a company meeting.Places where personal history, your own unique view of the world,ego, pride, marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled togetherinto a narrative that works for you.\n \n \nAnother important point that helps explain why money decisions areso difficult, and why there is so much misbehavior, is to recognizehow new this topic is.\nMoney has been around a long time. King Alyattes of Lydia, nowpart of Turkey, is thought to have created the first official currencyin 600 BC. But the modern foundation of money decisions—savingand investing—is based around concepts that are practically infants.\nTake retirement. At the end of 2018 there was $27 trillion in U.S.retirement accounts, making it the main driver of the common\ninvestor’s saving and investing decisions. ⁵\nBut the entire concept of being entitled to retirement is, at most, twogenerations old.\nBefore World War II most Americans worked until they died. Thatwas the expectation and the reality. The labor force participation rateof men age 65 and over was above 50% until the 1940s:\n\f\nSocial Security aimed to change this. But its initial benefits werenothing close to a proper pension. When Ida May Fuller cashed thefirst Social Security check in 1940, it was for $22.54, or $416adjusted for inflation. It was not until the 1980s that the averageSocial Security check for retirees exceeded $1,000 a month adjustedfor inflation. More than a quarter of Americans over age 65 wereclassified by the Census Bureau as living in poverty until the late1960s.\nThere is a widespread belief along the lines of, “everyone used tohave a private pension.” But this is wildly exaggerated. TheEmployee Benefit Research Institute explains: “Only a quarter ofthose age 65 or older had pension income in 1975.” Among thatlucky minority, only 15% of household income came from apension.\nThe New York Times wrote in 1955 about the growing desire, butcontinued inability, to retire: “To rephrase an old saying: everyonetalks about retirement, but apparently very few do anything about\nit.” ⁶"

    "raw_text": "It was not until the 1980s that the idea that everyone deserves, andshould have, a dignified retirement took hold. And the way to getthat dignified retirement ever since has been an expectation thateveryone will save and invest their own money.\nLet me reiterate how new this idea is: The 401(k)—the backbonesavings vehicle of American retirement—did not exist until 1978.The Roth IRA was not born until 1998. If it were a person it wouldbe barely old enough to drink.\nIt should surprise no one that many of us are bad at saving andinvesting for retirement. We’re not crazy. We’re all just newbies.\nSame goes for college. The share of Americans over age 25 with abachelor’s degree has gone from less than 1 in 20 in 1940 to 1 in 4\nby 2015. ⁷  The average college tuition over that time rose more than\nfourfold adjusted for inflation. ⁸  Something so big and so importanthitting society so fast explains why, for example, so many peoplehave made poor decisions with student loans over the last 20 years.There is not decades of accumulated experience to even attempt tolearn from. We’re winging it.\nSame for index funds, which are less than 50 years old. And hedgefunds, which didn’t take off until the last 25 years. Even widespreaduse of consumer debt—mortgages, credit cards, and car loans—didnot take off until after World War II, when the GI Bill made it easierfor millions of Americans to borrow.\nDogs were domesticated 10,000 years ago and still retain somebehaviors of their wild ancestors. Yet here we are, with between 20and 50 years of experience in the modern financial system, hoping tobe perfectly acclimated.\nFor a topic that is so influenced by emotion versus fact, this is aproblem. And it helps explain why we don’t always do what we’resupposed to with money.\nWe all do crazy stuff with money, because we’re all relatively new tothis game and what looks crazy to you might make sense to me. Butno one is crazy—we all make decisions based on our own uniqueexperiences that seem to make sense to us in a given moment.\nNow let me tell you a story about how Bill Gates got rich.\n\f\n\n\f\nLuck and risk are siblings. They are both the reality that every\noutcome in life is guided by forces other than individual effort.\nNYU professor Scott Galloway has a related idea that is so\nimportant to remember when judging success—both your own\nand others’: “Nothing is as good or as bad as it seems.”\n \n \nBill Gates went to one of the only high schools in the world\nthat had a computer.\nThe story of how Lakeside School, just outside Seattle, even\ngot a computer is remarkable.\nBill Dougall was a World War II navy pilot turned high school\nmath and science teacher. “He believed that book study wasn’t\nenough without real-world experience. He also realized that\nwe’d need to know something about computers when we got\nto college,” recalled late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen.\nIn 1968 Dougall petitioned the Lakeside School Mothers’\nClub to use the proceeds from its annual rummage sale—about\n$3,000—to lease a Teletype Model 30 computer hooked up to\nthe General Electric mainframe terminal for computer time-\nsharing. “The whole idea of time-sharing only got invented in\n1965,” Gates later said. “Someone was pretty\nforwardlooking.” Most university graduate schools did not\nhave a computer anywhere near as advanced as Bill Gates had\naccess to in eighth grade. And he couldn’t get enough of it.\nGates was 13 years old in 1968 when he met classmate Paul\nAllen. Allen was also obsessed with the school’s computer,\nand the two hit it off.\nLakeside’s computer wasn’t part of its general curriculum. It\nwas an independent study program. Bill and Paul could toy\naway with the thing at their leisure, letting their creativity run\nwild—after school, late into the night, on weekends. They\nquickly became computing experts.\nDuring one of their late-night sessions, Allen recalled Gates\nshowing him a Fortune magazine and saying, “What do you\n\f\nthink it’s like to run a Fortune 500 company?” Allen said he\nhad no idea. “Maybe we’ll have our own computer company\nsomeday,” Gates said. Microsoft is now worth more than a\ntrillion dollars.\nA little quick math.\nIn 1968 there were roughly 303 million high-school-age\npeople in the world, according to the UN.\nAbout 18 million of them lived in the United States.\nAbout 270,000 of them lived in Washington state.\nA little over 100,000 of them lived in the Seattle area.\nAnd only about 300 of them attended Lakeside School.\nStart with 303 million, end with 300.\nOne in a million high-school-age students attended the high\nschool that had the combination of cash and foresight to buy a\ncomputer. Bill Gates happened to be one of them.\nGates is not shy about what this meant. “If there had been no\nLakeside, there would have been no Microsoft,” he told the\nschool’s graduating class in 2005.\nGates is staggeringly smart, even more hardworking, and as a\nteenager had a vision for computers that even most seasoned\ncomputer executives couldn’t grasp. He also had a one in a\nmillion head start by going to school at Lakeside.\nNow let me tell you about Gates’ friend Kent Evans. He\nexperienced an equally powerful dose of luck’s close sibling,\nrisk.\nBill Gates and Paul Allen became household names thanks to\nMicrosoft’s success. But back at Lakeside there was a third\nmember of this gang of high-school computer prodigies.\nKent Evans and Bill Gates became best friends in eighth\ngrade. Evans was, by Gates’ own account, the best student in\nthe class.\nThe two talked “on the phone ridiculous amounts,” Gates\nrecalls in the documentary Inside Bill’s Brain. “I still know\nKent’s phone number,” he says. “525-7851.”"

    "raw_text": "Evans was as skilled with computers as Gates and Allen.\nLakeside once struggled to manually put together the school’s\nclass schedule—a maze of complexity to get hundreds of\nstudents the classes they need at times that don’t conflict with\nother courses. The school tasked Bill and Kent—children, by\nany measure—to build a computer program to solve the\nproblem. It worked.\nAnd unlike Paul Allen, Kent shared Bill’s business mind and\nendless ambition. “Kent always had the big briefcase, like a\nlawyer’s briefcase,” Gates recalls. “We were always scheming\nabout what we’d be doing five or six years in the future.\nShould we go be CEOs? What kind of impact could you have?\nShould we go be generals? Should we go be ambassadors?”\nWhatever it was, Bill and Kent knew they’d do it together.\nAfter reminiscing on his friendship with Kent, Gates trails off.\n“We would have kept working together. I’m sure we would\nhave gone to college together.” Kent could have been a\nfounding partner of Microsoft with Gates and Allen.\nBut it would never happen. Kent died in a mountaineering\naccident before he graduated high school.\nEvery year there are around three dozen mountaineering\ndeaths in the United States. ⁹  The odds of being killed on a\nmountain in high school are roughly one in a million.\nBill Gates experienced one in a million luck by ending up at\nLakeside. Kent Evans experienced one in a million risk by\nnever getting to finish what he and Gates set out to achieve.\nThe same force, the same magnitude, working in opposite\ndirections.\nLuck and risk are both the reality that every outcome in life is\nguided by forces other than individual effort. They are so\nsimilar that you can’t believe in one without equally respecting\nthe other. They both happen because the world is too complex\nto allow 100% of your actions to dictate 100% of your\noutcomes. They are driven by the same thing: You are one\nperson in a game with seven billion other people and infinite\nmoving parts. The accidental impact of actions outside of your\n\f\ncontrol can be more consequential than the ones you\nconsciously take.\nBut both are so hard to measure, and hard to accept, that they\ntoo often go overlooked. For every Bill Gates there is a Kent\nEvans who was just as skilled and driven but ended up on the\nother side of life roulette.\nIf you give luck and risk their proper respect, you realize that\nwhen judging people’s financial success—both your own and\nothers’—it’s never as good or as bad as it seems.\n \n \nYears ago I asked economist Robert Shiller, who won the\nNobel Prize in economics, “What do you want to know about\ninvesting that we can’t know?”\n“The exact role of luck in successful outcomes,” he answered.\nI love that response, because no one actually thinks luck\ndoesn’t play a role in financial success. But since it’s hard to\nquantify luck and rude to suggest people’s success is owed to\nit, the default stance is often to implicitly ignore luck as a\nfactor of success.\nIf I say, “There are a billion investors in the world. By sheer\nchance, would you expect 10 of them to become billionaires\npredominantly off luck?” You would reply, “Of course.” But\nthen if I ask you to name those investors—to their face—you\nwill likely back down.\nWhen judging others, attributing success to luck makes you\nlook jealous and mean, even if we know it exists. And when\njudging yourself, attributing success to luck can be too\ndemoralizing to accept.\nEconomist Bhashkar Mazumder has shown that incomes\namong brothers are more correlated than height or weight. If\nyou are rich and tall, your brother is more likely to also be rich\nthan he is tall. I think most of us intuitively know this is true—\nthe quality of your education and the doors that open for you\nare heavily linked to your parents’ socioeconomic status. But\n\f\nfind me two rich brothers and I’ll show you two men who do\nnot think this study’s findings apply to them.\nFailure—which can be anything from bankruptcy to not\nmeeting a personal goal—is equally abused.\nDid failed businesses not try hard enough? Were bad\ninvestments not thought through well enough? Are wayward\ncareers due to laziness? Sometimes, yes. Of course.\nBut how much? It’s so hard to know. Everything worth\npursuing has less than 100% odds of succeeding, and risk is\njust what happens when you end up on the unfortunate side of\nthat equation. Just as with luck, the story gets too hard, too\nmessy, too complex if we try to pick apart how much of an\noutcome was a conscious decision versus a risk.\nSay I buy a stock, and five years later it’s gone nowhere. It’s\npossible that I made a bad decision by buying it in the first\nplace. It’s also possible that I made a good decision that had an\n80% chance of making money, and I just happened to end up\non the side of the unfortunate 20%. How do I know which is\nwhich? Did I make a mistake, or did I just experience the\nreality of risk?\nIt’s possible to statistically measure whether some decisions\nwere wise. But in the real world, day to day, we simply don’t.\nIt’s too hard. We prefer simple stories, which are easy but\noften devilishly misleading.\nAfter spending years around investors and business leaders\nI’ve come to realize that someone else’s failure is usually\nattributed to bad decisions, while your own failures are usually\nchalked up to the dark side of risk. When judging your failures\nI’m likely to prefer a clean and simple story of cause and\neffect, because I don’t know what’s going on inside your head.\n“You had a bad outcome so it must have been caused by a bad\ndecision” is the story that makes the most sense to me. But\nwhen judging myself I can make up a wild narrative justifying\nmy past decisions and attributing bad outcomes to risk.\nThe cover of Forbes magazine does not celebrate poor\ninvestors who made good decisions but happened to\nexperience the unfortunate side of risk. But it almost certainly\n\f\ncelebrates rich investors who made OK or even reckless\ndecisions and happened to get lucky. Both flipped the same\ncoin that happened to land on a different side.\nThe dangerous part of this is that we’re all trying to learn\nabout what works and what doesn’t with money.\nWhat investing strategies work? Which ones don’t?\nWhat business strategies work? Which ones don’t?\nHow do you get rich? How do you avoid being poor?\nWe tend to seek out these lessons by observing successes and\nfailures and saying, “Do what she did, avoid what he did.”\nIf we had a magic wand we would find out exactly what\nproportion of these outcomes were caused by actions that are\nrepeatable, versus the role of random risk and luck that swayed\nthose actions one way or the other. But we don’t have a magic\nwand. We have brains that prefer easy answers without much\nappetite for nuance. So identifying the traits we should\nemulate or avoid can be agonizingly hard.\nLet me tell you another story of someone who, like Bill Gates,\nwas wildly successful, but whose success is hard to pin down\nas being caused by luck or skill.\n \n \nCornelius Vanderbilt had just finished a series of business\ndeals to expand his railroad empire.\nOne of his business advisors leaned in to tell Vanderbilt that\nevery transaction he agreed to broke the law.\n“My God, John,” said Vanderbilt, “You don’t suppose you can\nrun a railroad in accordance with the statutes of the State of\nNew York, do you?”¹ ⁰\nMy first thought when reading this was: “That attitude is why\nhe was so successful.” Laws didn’t accommodate railroads\nduring Vanderbilt’s day. So he said “to hell with it” and went\nahead anyway.\n\f\nVanderbilt was wildly successful. So it’s tempting to view his\nlaw-flaunting—which was notorious and vital to his success—\nas sage wisdom. That scrappy visionary let nothing get in his\nway!\nBut how dangerous is that analysis? No sane person would\nrecommend flagrant crime as an entrepreneurial trait. You can\neasily imagine Vanderbilt’s story turning out much different—\nan outlaw whose young company collapsed under court order.\nSo we have a problem here.\nYou can praise Vanderbilt for flaunting the law with as much\npassion as you criticize Enron for doing the same. Perhaps one\ngot lucky by avoiding the arm of the law while the other found\nitself on the side of risk.\nJohn D. Rockefeller is similar. His frequent circumventing of\nthe law—a judge once called his company “no better than a\ncommon thief”—is often portrayed by historians as cunning\nbusiness smarts. Maybe it was. But when does the narrative\nshift from, “You didn’t let outdated laws get in the way of\ninnovation,” to “You committed a crime?” Or how little would\nthe story have to shift for the narrative to have turned from\n“Rockefeller was a genius, try to learn from his successes,” to\n“Rockefeller was a criminal, try to learn from his business\nfailures.” Very little.\n“What do I care about the law?” Vanderbilt once said. “Ain’t I\ngot the power?”\nHe did, and it worked. But it’s easy to imagine those being the\nlast words of a story with a very different outcome. The line\nbetween bold and reckless can be thin. When we don’t give\nrisk and luck their proper billing it’s often invisible.\nBenjamin Graham is known as one of the greatest investors of\nall time, the father of value investing and the early mentor of\nWarren Buffett. But the majority of Benjamin Graham’s\ninvesting success was due to owning an enormous chunk of\nGEICO stock which, by his own admission, broke nearly\nevery diversification rule that Graham himself laid out in his\nfamous texts. Where does the thin line between bold and\nreckless fall here? I don’t know. Graham wrote about his\n\f\nGEICO bonanza: “One lucky break, or one supremely shrewd\ndecision—can we tell them apart?” Not easily.\nWe similarly think Mark Zuckerberg is a genius for turning\ndown Yahoo!’s 2006 $1 billion offer to buy his company. He\nsaw the future and stuck to his guns. But people criticize\nYahoo! with as much passion for turning down its own big\nbuyout offer from Microsoft—those fools should have cashed\nout while they could! What is the lesson for entrepreneurs\nhere? I have no idea, because risk and luck are so hard to pin\ndown.\nThere are so many examples of this.\nCountless fortunes (and failures) owe their outcome to\nleverage.\nThe best (and worst) managers drive their employees as hard\nas they can.\n“The customer is always right” and “customers don’t know\nwhat they want” are both accepted business wisdom.\nThe line between “inspiringly bold” and “foolishly reckless”\ncan be a millimeter thick and only visible with hindsight.\nRisk and luck are doppelgangers.\nThis is not an easy problem to solve. The difficulty in\nidentifying what is luck, what is skill, and what is risk is one\nof the biggest problems we face when trying to learn about the\nbest way to manage money.\nBut two things can point you in a better direction.\n \nBe careful who you praise and admire. Be careful who you\nlook down upon and wish to avoid becoming.\n \nOr, just be careful when assuming that 100% of outcomes can\nbe attributed to effort and decisions. After my son was born, I\nwrote him a letter that said, in part:"

    "raw_text": "Some people are born into families that encourage education;\nothers are against it. Some are born into flourishing economies\nencouraging of entrepreneurship; others are born into war and\ndestitution. I want you to be successful, and I want you to earn\nit. But realize that not all success is due to hard work, and not\nall poverty is due to laziness. Keep this in mind when judging\npeople, including yourself.\n \nTherefore, focus less on specific individuals and case\nstudies and more on broad patterns.\n \nStudying a specific person can be dangerous because we tend\nto study extreme examples—the billionaires, the CEOs, or the\nmassive failures that dominate the news—and extreme\nexamples are often the least applicable to other situations,\ngiven their complexity. The more extreme the outcome, the\nless likely you can apply its lessons to your own life, because\nthe more likely the outcome was influenced by extreme ends\nof luck or risk.\nYou’ll get closer to actionable takeaways by looking for broad\npatterns of success and failure. The more common the pattern,\nthe more applicable it might be to your life. Trying to emulate\nWarren Buffett’s investment success is hard, because his\nresults are so extreme that the role of luck in his lifetime\nperformance is very likely high, and luck isn’t something you\ncan reliably emulate. But realizing, as we’ll see in chapter 7,\nthat people who have control over their time tend to be happier\nin life is a broad and common enough observation that you can\ndo something with it.\nMy favorite historian, Frederick Lewis Allen, spent his career\ndepicting the life of the average, median American—how they\nlived, how they changed, what they did for work, what they\nate for dinner, etc. There are more relevant lessons to take\naway from this kind of broad observation than there are in\nstudying the extreme characters that tend to dominate the\nnews."

    "raw_text": "Bill Gates once said, “Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces\nsmart people into thinking they can’t lose.”\nWhen things are going extremely well, realize it’s not as good\nas you think. You are not invincible, and if you acknowledge\nthat luck brought you success then you have to believe in\nluck’s cousin, risk, which can turn your story around just as\nquickly.\nBut the same is true in the other direction.\nFailure can be a lousy teacher, because it seduces smart people\ninto thinking their decisions were terrible when sometimes\nthey just reflect the unforgiving realities of risk. The trick\nwhen dealing with failure is arranging your financial life in a\nway that a bad investment here and a missed financial goal\nthere won’t wipe you out so you can keep playing until the\nodds fall in your favor.\nBut more important is that as much as we recognize the role of\nluck in success, the role of risk means we should forgive\nourselves and leave room for understanding when judging\nfailures.\nNothing is as good or as bad as it seems.\nNow let’s look at the stories of two men who pushed their\nluck.\n\f\n\n\f\nJohn Bogle, the Vanguard founder who passed away in 2019,\nonce told a story about money that highlights something we\ndon’t think about enough:\n \nAt a party given by a billionaire on Shelter Island, Kurt\nVonnegut informs his pal, Joseph Heller, that their host, a\nhedge fund manager, had made more money in a single day\nthan Heller had earned from his wildly popular novel Catch-22\nover its whole history. Heller responds, “Yes, but I have\nsomething he will never have … enough.”\nEnough. I was stunned by the simple eloquence of that word—\nstunned for two reasons: first, because I have been given so\nmuch in my own life and, second, because Joseph Heller\ncouldn’t have been more accurate.\nFor a critical element of our society, including many of the\nwealthiest and most powerful among us, there seems to be no\nlimit today on what enough entails.\n \nIt’s so smart, and so powerful.\nLet me offer two examples of the dangers of not having\nenough, and what they can teach us.\n \n \nRajat Gupta was born in Kolkata and orphaned as a teenager.\nPeople talk about the privileged few who begin life on third\nbase. Gupta couldn’t even see the baseball stadium.\nWhat he went on to achieve from those beginnings was simply\nphenomenal.\nBy his mid 40s Gupta was CEO of McKinsey, the world’s\nmost prestigious consulting firm. He retired in 2007 to take on\nroles with the United Nations and the World Economic Forum.\nHe partnered on philanthropic work with Bill Gates. He sat on\nthe board of directors of five public companies. From the\n\f\nslums of Kolkata, Gupta had quite literally become one of the\nmost successful businessmen alive.\nWith his success came enormous wealth. By 2008 Gupta was\nreportedly worth $100 million.¹¹ It’s an unfathomable sum of\nmoney to most. A five percent annual return on that much\nmoney generates almost $600 an hour, 24 hours a day.\nHe could have done anything he wanted in life.\nAnd what he wanted, by all accounts, wasn’t to be a mere\ncenta-millionaire. Rajat Gupta wanted to be a billionaire. And\nhe wanted it badly.\nGupta sat on the board of directors of Goldman Sachs, which\nsurrounded him with some of the wealthiest investors in the\nworld. One investor, citing the paydays of private equity\ntycoons, described Gupta like this: “I think he wants to be in\nthat circle. That’s a billionaire circle, right? Goldman is like\nthe hundreds of millions circle, right?”¹²\nRight. So Gupta found a lucrative side hustle.\nIn 2008, as Goldman Sachs stared at the wrath of the financial\ncrisis, Warren Buffett planned to invest $5 billion into the\nbank to help it survive. As a Goldman board member Gupta\nlearned of this transaction before the public. It was valuable\ninformation. Goldman’s survival was in doubt and Buffett’s\nbacking would surely send its stock soaring.\nSixteen seconds after learning of the pending deal Gupta, who\nwas dialed into the Goldman board meeting, hung up the\nphone and called a hedge fund manager named Raj\nRajaratnam. The call wasn’t recorded, but Rajaratnam\nimmediately bought 175,000 shares of Goldman Sachs, so you\ncan guess what was discussed. The Buffett-Goldman deal was\nannounced to the public hours later. Goldman stock surged.\nRajaratnam made a quick $1 million.\nThat was just one example of an alleged trend. The SEC\nclaims Gupta’s insider tips led to $17 million in profits.\nIt was easy money. And, for prosecutors, it was an even easier\ncase.\n\f\nGupta and Rajaratnam both went to prison for insider trading,\ntheir careers and reputations irrevocably ruined.\nNow consider Bernie Madoff. His crime is well known.\nMadoff is the most notorious Ponzi schemer since Charles\nPonzi himself. Madoff swindled investors for two decades\nbefore his crime was revealed—ironically just weeks after\nGupta’s endeavor.\nWhat’s overlooked is that Madoff, like Gupta, was more than a\nfraudster. Before the Ponzi scheme that made Madoff famous\nhe was a wildly successful and legitimate businessman.\nMadoff was a market maker, a job that matches buyers and\nsellers of stocks. He was very good at it. Here’s how The Wall\nStreet Journal described Madoff’s market-making firm in\n1992:\n \nHe has built a highly profitable securities firm, Bernard L.\nMadoff Investment Securities, which siphons a huge volume\nof stock trades away from the Big Board. The $740 million\naverage daily volume of trades executed electronically by the\nMadoff firm off the exchange equals 9% of the New York\nexchange’s. Mr. Madoff’s firm can execute trades so quickly\nand cheaply that it actually pays other brokerage firms a penny\na share to execute their customers’ orders, profiting from the\nspread between bid and ask prices that most stocks trade for.\n \nThis is not a journalist inaccurately describing a fraud yet to be\nuncovered; Madoff’s market-making business was legitimate.\nA former staffer said the market-making arm of Madoff’s\nbusiness made between $25 million and $50 million per year.\nBernie Madoff’s legitimate, non-fraudulent business was by\nany measure a huge success. It made him hugely—and\nlegitimately—wealthy.\nAnd yet, the fraud.\nThe question we should ask of both Gupta and Madoff is why\nsomeone worth hundreds of millions of dollars would be so\n\f\ndesperate for more money that they risked everything in\npursuit of even more.\nCrime committed by those living on the edge of survival is one\nthing. A Nigerian scam artist once told The New York Times\nthat he felt guilty for hurting others, but “poverty will not\nmake you feel the pain.”¹³\nWhat Gupta and Madoff did is something different. They\nalready had everything: unimaginable wealth, prestige, power,\nfreedom. And they threw it all away because they wanted\nmore.\nThey had no sense of enough.\nThey are extreme examples. But there are non-criminal\nversions of this behavior.\nThe hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management was staffed\nwith traders personally worth tens and hundreds of millions of\ndollars each, with most of their wealth invested in their own\nfunds. Then they took so much risk in the quest for more that\nthey managed to lose everything—in 1998, in the middle of\nthe greatest bull market and strongest economy in history.\nWarren Buffett later put it:\n \nTo make money they didn’t have and didn’t need, they risked\nwhat they did have and did need. And that’s foolish. It is just\nplain foolish. If you risk something that is important to you for\nsomething that is unimportant to you, it just does not make any\nsense.\n \nThere is no reason to risk what you have and need for what\nyou don’t have and don’t need.\nIt’s one of those things that’s as obvious as it is overlooked.\nFew of us will ever have $100 million, as Gupta or Madoff\ndid. But a measurable percentage of those reading this book\nwill, at some point in their life, earn a salary or have a sum of\nmoney sufficient to cover every reasonable thing they need\nand a lot of what they want.\n\f\nIf you’re one of them, remember a few things.\n \n1. The hardest financial skill is getting the goalpost to stop\nmoving.\n \nBut it’s one of the most important. If expectations rise with\nresults there is no logic in striving for more because you’ll feel\nthe same after putting in extra effort. It gets dangerous when\nthe taste of having more—more money, more power, more\nprestige—increases ambition faster than satisfaction. In that\ncase one step forward pushes the goalpost two steps ahead.\nYou feel as if you’re falling behind, and the only way to catch\nup is to take greater and greater amounts of risk.\nModern capitalism is a pro at two things: generating wealth\nand generating envy. Perhaps they go hand in hand; wanting to\nsurpass your peers can be the fuel of hard work. But life isn’t\nany fun without a sense of enough. Happiness, as it’s said, is\njust results minus expectations.\n \n2. Social comparison is the problem here.\n \nConsider a rookie baseball player who earns $500,000 a year.\nHe is, by any definition, rich. But say he plays on the same\nteam as Mike Trout, who has a 12-year, $430 million contract.\nBy comparison, the rookie is broke. But then think about Mike\nTrout. Thirty-six million dollars per year is an insane amount\nof money. But to make it on the list of the top-ten highest-paid\nhedge fund managers in 2018 you needed to earn at least $340\nmillion in one year.¹ ⁴  That’s who people like Trout might\ncompare their incomes to. And the hedge fund manager who\nmakes $340 million per year compares himself to the top five\nhedge fund managers, who earned at least $770 million in\n2018. Those top managers can look ahead to people like\nWarren Buffett, whose personal fortune increased by $3.5\nbillion in 2018. And someone like Buffett could look ahead to\nJeff Bezos, whose net worth increased by $24 billion in 2018\n\f\n—a sum that equates to more per hour than the “rich” baseball\nplayer made in a full year.\nThe point is that the ceiling of social comparison is so high\nthat virtually no one will ever hit it. Which means it’s a battle\nthat can never be won, or that the only way to win is to not\nfight to begin with—to accept that you might have enough,\neven if it’s less than those around you.\nA friend of mine makes an annual pilgrimage to Las Vegas.\nOne year he asked a dealer: What games do you play, and\nwhat casinos do you play in? The dealer, stone-cold serious,\nreplied: “The only way to win in a Las Vegas casino is to exit\nas soon as you enter.”\nThat’s exactly how the game of trying to keep up with other\npeople’s wealth works, too.\n \n3. “Enough” is not too little.\n \nThe idea of having “enough” might look like conservatism,\nleaving opportunity and potential on the table.\nI don’t think that’s right.\n“Enough” is realizing that the opposite—an insatiable appetite\nfor more—will push you to the point of regret.\nThe only way to know how much food you can eat is to eat\nuntil you’re sick. Few try this because vomiting hurts more\nthan any meal is good. For some reason the same logic doesn’t\ntranslate to business and investing, and many will only stop\nreaching for more when they break and are forced to. This can\nbe as innocent as burning out at work or a risky investment\nallocation you can’t maintain. On the other end there’s Rajat\nGuptas and Bernie Madoffs in the world, who resort to\nstealing because every dollar is worth reaching for regardless\nof consequence.\nWhatever it is, the inability to deny a potential dollar will\neventually catch up to you.\n\f\n4. There are many things never worth risking, no matter\nthe potential gain.\n \nAfter he was released from prison Rajat Gupta told The New\nYork Times he had learned a lesson:\n \nDon’t get too attached to anything—your reputation, your\naccomplishments or any of it. I think about it now, what does\nit matter? O.K., this thing unjustly destroyed my reputation.\nThat’s only troubling if I am so attached to my reputation.\n \nThis seems like the worst possible takeaway from his\nexperience, and what I imagine is the comforting self-\njustifications of a man who desperately wants his reputation\nback but knows it’s gone.\n \nReputation is invaluable.\nFreedom and independence are invaluable.\nFamily and friends are invaluable.\nBeing loved by those who you want to love you is invaluable.\nHappiness is invaluable.\nAnd your best shot at keeping these things is knowing when\nit’s time to stop taking risks that might harm them. Knowing\nwhen you have enough.\nThe good news is that the most powerful tool for building\nenough is remarkably simple, and doesn’t require taking risks\nthat could damage any of these things. That’s the next chapter."

    "raw_text": "Lessons from one field can often teach us something important\nabout unrelated fields. Take the billion-year history of ice\nages, and what they teach us about growing your money.\n \n \nOur scientific knowledge of Earth is younger than you might\nthink. Understanding how the world works often involves\ndrilling deep below its surface, something we haven’t been\nable to do until fairly recently. Isaac Newton calculated the\nmovement of the stars hundreds of years before we understood\nsome of the basics of our planet.\nIt was not until the 19th century that scientists agreed that\nEarth had, on multiple occasions, been covered in ice.¹ ⁵  There\nwas too much evidence to argue otherwise. All over the world\nsat fingerprints of a previously frozen world: huge boulders\nstrewn in random locations; rock beds scraped down to thin\nlayers. Evidence became clear that there had not been one ice\nage, but five distinct ones we could measure.\nThe amount of energy needed to freeze the planet, melt it\nanew, and freeze it over yet again is staggering. What on Earth\n(literally) could be causing these cycles? It must be the most\npowerful force on our planet.\nAnd it was. Just not in the way anyone expected.\nThere were plenty of theories about why ice ages occurred. To\naccount for their enormous geological influence the theories\nwere equally grand. The uplifting of mountain ranges, it was\nthought, may have shifted the Earth’s winds enough to alter\nthe climate. Others favored the idea that ice was the natural\nstate, interrupted by massive volcanic eruptions that warmed\nus up.\nBut none of these theories could account for the cycle of ice\nages. The growth of mountain ranges or some massive volcano\nmay explain one ice age. It could not explain the cyclical\nrepetition of five.\n\f\nIn the early 1900s a Serbian scientist named Milutin\nMilanković studied the Earth’s position relative to other\nplanets and came up with the theory of ice ages that we now\nknow is accurate: The gravitational pull of the sun and moon\ngently affect the Earth’s motion and tilt toward the sun. During\nparts of this cycle—which can last tens of thousands of years\n—each of the Earth’s hemispheres gets a little more, or a little\nless, solar radiation than they’re used to.\nAnd that is where the fun begins.\nMilanković’s theory initially assumed that a tilt of the Earth’s\nhemispheres caused ravenous winters cold enough to turn the\nplanet into ice. But a Russian meteorologist named Wladimir\nKöppen dug deeper into Milanković’s work and discovered a\nfascinating nuance.\nModerately cool summers, not cold winters, were the icy\nculprit.\nIt begins when a summer never gets warm enough to melt the\nprevious winter’s snow. The leftover ice base makes it easier\nfor snow to accumulate the following winter, which increases\nthe odds of snow sticking around in the following summer,\nwhich attracts even more accumulation the following winter.\nPerpetual snow reflects more of the sun’s rays, which\nexacerbates cooling, which brings more snowfall, and on and\non. Within a few hundred years a seasonal snowpack grows\ninto a continental ice sheet, and you’re off to the races.\nThe same thing happens in reverse. An orbital tilt letting more\nsunlight in melts more of the winter snowpack, which reflects\nless light the following years, which increases temperatures,\nwhich prevents more snow the next year, and so on. That’s the\ncycle.\nThe amazing thing here is how big something can grow from a\nrelatively small change in conditions. You start with a thin\nlayer of snow left over from a cool summer that no one would\nthink anything of and then, in a geological blink of an eye, the\nentire Earth is covered in miles-thick ice. As glaciologist\nGwen Schultz put it: “It is not necessarily the amount of snow\n\f\nthat causes ice sheets but the fact that snow, however little,\nlasts.”\nThe big takeaway from ice ages is that you don’t need\ntremendous force to create tremendous results.\nIf something compounds—if a little growth serves as the fuel\nfor future growth—a small starting base can lead to results so\nextraordinary they seem to defy logic. It can be so logic-\ndefying that you underestimate what’s possible, where growth\ncomes from, and what it can lead to.\nAnd so it is with money.\n \n \nMore than 2,000 books are dedicated to how Warren Buffett\nbuilt his fortune. Many of them are wonderful. But few pay\nenough attention to the simplest fact: Buffett’s fortune isn’t\ndue to just being a good investor, but being a good investor\nsince he was literally a child.\nAs I write this Warren Buffett’s net worth is $84.5 billion. Of\nthat, $84.2 billion was accumulated after his 50th birthday.\n$81.5 billion came after he qualified for Social Security, in his\nmid-60s.\nWarren Buffett is a phenomenal investor. But you miss a key\npoint if you attach all of his success to investing acumen. The\nreal key to his success is that he’s been a phenomenal investor\nfor three quarters of a century. Had he started investing in his\n30s and retired in his 60s, few people would have ever heard\nof him.\nConsider a little thought experiment.\nBuffett began serious investing when he was 10 years old. By\nthe time he was 30 he had a net worth of $1 million, or $9.3\nmillion adjusted for inflation.¹ ⁶\nWhat if he was a more normal person, spending his teens and\n20s exploring the world and finding his passion, and by age 30\nhis net worth was, say, $25,000?\n\f\nAnd let’s say he still went on to earn the extraordinary annual\ninvestment returns he’s been able to generate (22% annually),\nbut quit investing and retired at age 60 to play golf and spend\ntime with his grandkids.\nWhat would a rough estimate of his net worth be today?\nNot $84.5 billion.\n$11.9 million.\n99.9% less than his actual net worth.\nEffectively all of Warren Buffett’s financial success can be tied\nto the financial base he built in his pubescent years and the\nlongevity he maintained in his geriatric years.\nHis skill is investing, but his secret is time.\nThat’s how compounding works.\nThink of this another way. Buffett is the richest investor of all\ntime. But he’s not actually the greatest—at least not when\nmeasured by average annual returns.\nJim Simons, head of the hedge fund Renaissance\nTechnologies, has compounded money at 66% annually since\n1988. No one comes close to this record. As we just saw,\nBuffett has compounded at roughly 22% annually, a third as\nmuch.\nSimons’ net worth, as I write, is $21 billion. He is—and I\nknow how ridiculous this sounds given the numbers we’re\ndealing with—75% less rich than Buffett.\nWhy the difference, if Simons is such a better investor?\nBecause Simons did not find his investment stride until he was\n50 years old. He’s had less than half as many years to\ncompound as Buffett. If James Simons had earned his 66%\nannual returns for the 70-year span Buffett has built his wealth\nhe would be worth—please hold your breath—sixty-three\nquintillion nine hundred quadrillion seven hundred eighty-one\ntrillion seven hundred eighty billion seven hundred forty-eight\nmillion one hundred sixty thousand dollars.\nThese are ridiculous, impractical numbers. The point is that\nwhat seem like small changes in growth assumptions can lead\n\f\nto ridiculous, impractical numbers. And so when we are\nstudying why something got to become as powerful as it has—\nwhy an ice age formed, or why Warren Buffett is so rich—we\noften overlook the key drivers of success.\nI have heard many people say the first time they saw a\ncompound interest table—or one of those stories about how\nmuch more you’d have for retirement if you began saving in\nyour 20s versus your 30s—changed their life. But it probably\ndidn’t. What it likely did was surprise them, because the\nresults intuitively didn’t seem right. Linear thinking is so\nmuch more intuitive than exponential thinking. If I ask you to\ncalculate 8+8+8+8+8+8+8+8+8 in your head, you can do it in\na few seconds (it’s 72). If I ask you to calculate\n8×8×8×8×8×8×8×8×8, your head will explode (it’s\n134,217,728).\nIBM made a 3.5 megabyte hard drive in the 1950s. By the\n1960s things were moving into a few dozen megabytes. By the\n1970s, IBM’s Winchester drive held 70 megabytes. Then\ndrives got exponentially smaller in size with more storage. A\ntypical PC in the early 1990s held 200–500 megabytes.\nAnd then … wham. Things exploded.\n1999—Apple’s iMac comes with a 6 gigabyte hard drive.\n2003—120 gigs on the Power Mac.\n2006—250 gigs on the new iMac.\n2011—first 4 terabyte hard drive.\n2017—60 terabyte hard drives.\n2019—100 terabyte hard drives.\nPut that all together: From 1950 to 1990 we gained 296\nmegabytes. From 1990 through today we gained 100 million\nmegabytes.\nIf you were a technology optimist in the 1950s you may have\npredicted that practical storage would become 1,000 times\nlarger. Maybe 10,000 times larger, if you were swinging for\nthe fences. Few would have said “30 million times larger\nwithin my lifetime.” But that’s what happened.\n\f\nThe counterintuitive nature of compounding leads even the\nsmartest of us to overlook its power. In 2004 Bill Gates\ncriticized the new Gmail, wondering why anyone would need\na gigabyte of storage. Author Steven Levy wrote, “Despite his\ncurrency with cutting-edge technologies, his mentality was\nanchored in the old paradigm of storage being a commodity\nthat must be conserved.” You never get accustomed to how\nquickly things can grow.\nThe danger here is that when compounding isn’t intuitive we\noften ignore its potential and focus on solving problems\nthrough other means. Not because we’re overthinking, but\nbecause we rarely stop to consider compounding potential.\nNone of the 2,000 books picking apart Buffett’s success are\ntitled This Guy Has Been Investing Consistently for Three-\nQuarters of a Century. But we know that’s the key to the\nmajority of his success. It’s just hard to wrap your head around\nthat math because it’s not intuitive.\nThere are books on economic cycles, trading strategies, and\nsector bets. But the most powerful and important book should\nbe called Shut Up And Wait. It’s just one page with a long-\nterm chart of economic growth.\nThe practical takeaway is that the counterintuitiveness of\ncompounding may be responsible for the majority of\ndisappointing trades, bad strategies, and successful investing\nattempts.\nYou can’t blame people for devoting all their effort—effort in\nwhat they learn and what they do—to trying to earn the\nhighest investment returns. It intuitively seems like the best\nway to get rich.\nBut good investing isn’t necessarily about earning the highest\nreturns, because the highest returns tend to be one-off hits that\ncan’t be repeated. It’s about earning pretty good returns that\nyou can stick with and which can be repeated for the longest\nperiod of time. That’s when compounding runs wild.\nThe opposite of this—earning huge returns that can’t be held\nonto—leads to some tragic stories. We’ll need the next chapter\nto tell them.\n\f\n\n\f\nThere are a million ways to get wealthy, and plenty of books on howto do so.\nBut there’s only one way to stay wealthy: some combination offrugality and paranoia.\nAnd that’s a topic we don’t discuss enough.\nLet’s begin with a quick story about two investors, neither of whomknew the other, but whose paths crossed in an interesting way almosta century ago.\n \n \nJesse Livermore was the greatest stock market trader of his day.Born in 1877, he became a professional trader before most peopleknew you could do such a thing. By age 30 he was worth theinflation-adjusted equivalent of $100 million.\nBy 1929 Jesse Livermore was already one of the most well-knowninvestors in the world. The stock market crash that year that usheredin the Great Depression cemented his legacy in history.\nMore than a third of the stock market’s value was wiped out in anOctober 1929 week whose days were later named Black Monday,Black Tuesday, and Black Thursday.\nLivermore’s wife Dorothy feared the worst when her husbandreturned home on October 29th. Reports of Wall Street speculatorscommitting suicide were spreading across New York. She and herchildren greeted Jesse at the door in tears, while her mother was sodistraught she hid in another room, screaming.\nJesse, according to biographer Tom Rubython, stood confused for afew moments before realizing what was happening.\nHe then broke the news to his family: In a stroke of genius and luck,he had been short the market, betting stocks would decline.\n“You mean we are not ruined?” Dorothy asked.\n“No darling, I have just had my best ever trading day—we arefabulously rich and can do whatever we like,” Jesse said.\nDorothy ran to her mother and told her to be quiet.\nIn one day Jesse Livermore made the equivalent of more than $3billion."

    "raw_text": "During one of the worst months in the history of the stock market hebecame one of the richest men in the world.\nAs Livermore’s family celebrated their unfathomable success,another man wandered the streets of New York in desperation.\nAbraham Germansky was a multimillionaire real estate developerwho made a fortune during the roaring 1920s. As the economyboomed, he did what virtually every other successful New Yorkerdid in the late 1920s: bet heavily on the surging stock market.\nOn October 26th, 1929, The New York Times published an articlethat in two paragraphs portrays a tragic ending:\n \nBernard H. Sandler, attorney of 225 Broadway, was asked yesterdaymorning by Mrs. Abraham Germansky of Mount Vernon to help findher husband, missing since Thursday Morning. Germansky, who is50 years old and an east side real estate operator, was said bySandler to have invested heavily in stocks.\nSandler said he was told by Mrs. Germansky that a friend saw herhusband late Thursday on Wall Street near the stock exchange.According to her informant, her husband was tearing a strip of tickertape into bits and scattering it on the sidewalk as he walked towardBroadway.\n \nAnd that, as far as we know, was the end of Abraham Germansky.\nHere we have a contrast.\nThe October 1929 crash made Jesse Livermore one of the richestmen in the world. It ruined Abraham Germansky, perhaps taking hislife.\nBut fast-forward four years and the stories cross paths again.\nAfter his 1929 blowout Livermore, overflowing with confidence,made larger and larger bets. He wound up far over his head, inincreasing amounts of debt, and eventually lost everything in thestock market.\nBroke and ashamed, he disappeared for two days in 1933. His wifeset out to find him. “Jesse L. Livermore, the stock market operator,of 1100 Park Avenue missing and has not been seen since 3pmyesterday,” The New York Times wrote in 1933."

    "raw_text": "He returned, but his path was set. Livermore eventually took his ownlife.\nThe timing was different, but Germansky and Livermore shared acharacter trait: They were both very good at getting wealthy, andequally bad at staying wealthy.\nEven if “wealthy” is not a word you’d apply to yourself, the lessonsfrom that observation apply to everyone, at all income levels.\nGetting money is one thing.\nKeeping it is another.\n \n \nIf I had to summarize money success in a single word it would be“survival.”\nAs we’ll see in chapter 6, 40% of companies successful enough tobecome publicly traded lost effectively all of their value over time.The Forbes 400 list of richest Americans has, on average, roughly20% turnover per decade for causes that don’t have to do with death\nor transferring money to another family member.¹ ⁷\nCapitalism is hard. But part of the reason this happens is becausegetting money and keeping money are two different skills.\nGetting money requires taking risks, being optimistic, and puttingyourself out there.\nBut keeping money requires the opposite of taking risk. It requireshumility, and fear that what you’ve made can be taken away fromyou just as fast. It requires frugality and an acceptance that at leastsome of what you’ve made is attributable to luck, so past successcan’t be relied upon to repeat indefinitely.\nMichael Moritz, the billionaire head of Sequoia Capital, was askedby Charlie Rose why Sequoia was so successful. Moritz mentionedlongevity, noting that some VC firms succeed for five or ten years,but Sequoia has prospered for four decades. Rose asked why thatwas:\n \nMoritz: I think we’ve always been afraid of going out of business.\n \nRose: Really? So it’s fear? Only the paranoid survive?"

    "raw_text": "Moritz: There’s a lot of truth to that … We assume that tomorrowwon’t be like yesterday. We can’t afford to rest on our laurels. Wecan’t be complacent. We can’t assume that yesterday’s successtranslates into tomorrow’s good fortune.\n \nHere again, survival.\nNot “growth” or “brains” or “insight.” The ability to stick around fora long time, without wiping out or being forced to give up, is whatmakes the biggest difference. This should be the cornerstone of yourstrategy, whether it’s in investing or your career or a business youown.\nThere are two reasons why a survival mentality is so key withmoney.\nOne is the obvious: few gains are so great that they’re worth wipingyourself out over.\nThe other, as we saw in chapter 4, is the counterintuitive math ofcompounding.\nCompounding only works if you can give an asset years and years togrow. It’s like planting oak trees: A year of growth will never showmuch progress, 10 years can make a meaningful difference, and 50years can create something absolutely extraordinary.\nBut getting and keeping that extraordinary growth requires survivingall the unpredictable ups and downs that everyone inevitablyexperiences over time.\nWe can spend years trying to figure out how Buffett achieved hisinvestment returns: how he found the best companies, the cheapeststocks, the best managers. That’s hard. Less hard but equallyimportant is pointing out what he didn’t do.\nHe didn’t get carried away with debt.\nHe didn’t panic and sell during the 14 recessions he’s lived through.\nHe didn’t sully his business reputation.\nHe didn’t attach himself to one strategy, one world view, or onepassing trend.\nHe didn’t rely on others’ money (managing investments through apublic company meant investors couldn’t withdraw their capital).\n\f\nHe didn’t burn himself out and quit or retire.\nHe survived. Survival gave him longevity. And longevity—investingconsistently from age 10 to at least age 89—is what madecompounding work wonders. That single point is what matters mostwhen describing his success.\nTo show you what I mean, you have to hear the story of RickGuerin.\nYou’ve likely heard of the investing duo of Warren Buffett andCharlie Munger. But 40 years ago there was a third member of thegroup, Rick Guerin.\nWarren, Charlie, and Rick made investments together andinterviewed business managers together. Then Rick kind ofdisappeared, at least relative to Buffett and Munger’s success.Investor Mohnish Pabrai once asked Buffett what happened to Rick.Mohnish recalled:\n \n[Warren said] “Charlie and I always knew that we would becomeincredibly wealthy. We were not in a hurry to get wealthy; we knewit would happen. Rick was just as smart as us, but he was in ahurry.”\nWhat happened was that in the 1973–1974 downturn, Rick waslevered with margin loans. And the stock market went down almost70% in those two years, so he got margin calls. He sold hisBerkshire stock to Warren—Warren actually said “I bought Rick’sBerkshire stock”—at under $40 a piece. Rick was forced to sell\nbecause he was levered.¹ ⁸\n \nCharlie, Warren, and Rick were equally skilled at getting wealthy.But Warren and Charlie had the added skill of staying wealthy.Which, over time, is the skill that matters most.\nNassim Taleb put it this way: “Having an ‘edge’ and surviving aretwo different things: the first requires the second. You need to avoidruin. At all costs.”\n \n \nApplying the survival mindset to the real world comes down toappreciating three things.\n\f\n1. More than I want big returns, I want to be financiallyunbreakable. And if I’m unbreakable I actually think I’ll get thebiggest returns, because I’ll be able to stick around long enoughfor compounding to work wonders.\n \nNo one wants to hold cash during a bull market. They want to ownassets that go up a lot. You look and feel conservative holding cashduring a bull market, because you become acutely aware of howmuch return you’re giving up by not owning the good stuff. Say cashearns 1% and stocks return 10% a year. That 9% gap will gnaw atyou every day.\nBut if that cash prevents you from having to sell your stocks duringa bear market, the actual return you earned on that cash is not 1% ayear—it could be many multiples of that, because preventing onedesperate, ill-timed stock sale can do more for your lifetime returnsthan picking dozens of big-time winners.\nCompounding doesn’t rely on earning big returns. Merely goodreturns sustained uninterrupted for the longest period of time—especially in times of chaos and havoc—will always win.\n \n2. Planning is important, but the most important part of everyplan is to plan on the plan not going according to plan.\n \nWhat’s the saying? You plan, God laughs. Financial and investmentplanning are critical, because they let you know whether yourcurrent actions are within the realm of reasonable. But few plans ofany kind survive their first encounter with the real world. If you’reprojecting your income, savings rate, and market returns over thenext 20 years, think about all the big stuff that’s happened in the last20 years that no one could have foreseen: September 11th, a housingboom and bust that caused nearly 10 million Americans to lose theirhomes, a financial crisis that caused almost nine million to lose theirjobs, a record-breaking stock-market rally that ensued, and acoronavirus that shakes the world as I write this.\nA plan is only useful if it can survive reality. And a future filled withunknowns is everyone’s reality.\nA good plan doesn’t pretend this weren’t true; it embraces it andemphasizes room for error. The more you need specific elements of\n\f\na plan to be true, the more fragile your financial life becomes. Ifthere’s enough room for error in your savings rate that you can say,“It’d be great if the market returns 8% a year over the next 30 years,but if it only does 4% a year I’ll still be OK,” the more valuable yourplan becomes.\nMany bets fail not because they were wrong, but because they weremostly right in a situation that required things to be exactly right.Room for error—often called margin of safety—is one of the mostunderappreciated forces in finance. It comes in many forms: Afrugal budget, flexible thinking, and a loose timeline—anything thatlets you live happily with a range of outcomes.\nIt’s different from being conservative. Conservative is avoiding acertain level of risk. Margin of safety is raising the odds of successat a given level of risk by increasing your chances of survival. Itsmagic is that the higher your margin of safety, the smaller your edgeneeds to be to have a favorable outcome.\n \n3. A barbelled personality—optimistic about the future, butparanoid about what will prevent you from getting to the future—is vital.\n \nOptimism is usually defined as a belief that things will go well. Butthat’s incomplete. Sensible optimism is a belief that the odds are inyour favor, and over time things will balance out to a good outcomeeven if what happens in between is filled with misery. And in factyou know it will be filled with misery. You can be optimistic that thelong-term growth trajectory is up and to the right, but equally surethat the road between now and then is filled with landmines, andalways will be. Those two things are not mutually exclusive.\nThe idea that something can gain over the long run while being abasketcase in the short run is not intuitive, but it’s how a lot of thingswork in life. By age 20 the average person can lose roughly half thesynaptic connections they had in their brain at age two, as inefficientand redundant neural pathways are cleared out. But the average 20-year-old is much smarter than the average two-year-old. Destructionin the face of progress is not only possible, but an efficient way toget rid of excess.\nImagine if you were a parent and could see inside your child’s brain.Every morning you notice fewer synaptic connections in your kid’shead. You would panic! You would say, “This can’t be right, there’s\n\f\nloss and destruction here. We need an intervention. We need to see adoctor!” But you don’t. What you are witnessing is the normal pathof progress.\nEconomies, markets, and careers often follow a similar path—growth amid loss.\nHere’s how the U.S. economy performed over the last 170 years:\n \n \nBut do you know what happened during this period? Where do webegin …\n \n \n1.3 million Americans died while fighting nine major wars.\n \nRoughly 99.9% of all companies that were created went out ofbusiness.\n\f\nFour U.S. presidents were assassinated.\n \n675,000 Americans died in a single year from a flu pandemic.\n \n30 separate natural disasters killed at least 400 Americans each.\n \n33 recessions lasted a cumulative 48 years.\n \nThe number of forecasters who predicted any of those recessionsrounds to zero.\n \nThe stock market fell more than 10% from a recent high at least 102times.\n \nStocks lost a third of their value at least 12 times.\n \nAnnual inflation exceeded 7% in 20 separate years.\n \nThe words “economic pessimism” appeared in newspapers at least29,000 times, according to Google.\n \nOur standard of living increased 20-fold in these 170 years, butbarely a day went by that lacked tangible reasons for pessimism.\nA mindset that can be paranoid and optimistic at the same time ishard to maintain, because seeing things as black or white takes lesseffort than accepting nuance. But you need short-term paranoia tokeep you alive long enough to exploit long-term optimism.\nJesse Livermore figured this out the hard way.\nHe associated good times with the end of bad times. Getting wealthymade him feel like staying wealthy was inevitable, and that he wasinvincible. After losing nearly everything he reflected:"

    "raw_text": "“I’ve been banging away at this thing for 30 years. I think thesimple math is, some projects work and some don’t. There’s noreason to belabor either one. Just get on to the next.”\n \n—Brad Pitt accepting a Screen Actors Guild Award\n \nHeinz Berggruen fled Nazi Germany in 1936. He settled in America,where he studied literature at U.C. Berkeley.\nBy most accounts he did not show particular promise in his youth.But by the 1990s Berggruen was, by any measure, one of the mostsuccessful art dealers of all time.\nIn 2000 Berggruen sold part of his massive collection of Picassos,Braques, Klees, and Matisses to the German government for morethan 100 million euros. It was such a bargain that the Germanseffectively considered it a donation. The private market value of thecollection was well over a $1 billion.\nThat one person can collect huge quantities of masterpieces isastounding. Art is as subjective as it gets. How could anyone haveforeseen, early in life, what were to become the most sought-afterworks of the century?\nYou could say “skill.”\nYou could say “luck.”\nThe investment firm Horizon Research has a third explanation. Andit’s very relevant to investors.\n“The great investors bought vast quantities of art,” the firm writes.¹ ⁹“A subset of the collections turned out to be great investments, andthey were held for a sufficiently long period of time to allow theportfolio return to converge upon the return of the best elements inthe portfolio. That’s all that happens.”\nThe great art dealers operated like index funds. They boughteverything they could. And they bought it in portfolios, notindividual pieces they happened to like. Then they sat and waited fora few winners to emerge.\nThat’s all that happens.\nPerhaps 99% of the works someone like Berggruen acquired in hislife turned out to be of little value. But that doesn’t particularlymatter if the other 1% turn out to be the work of someone like\n\f\nPicasso. Berggruen could be wrong most of the time and still end upstupendously right.\nA lot of things in business and investing work this way. Long tails—the farthest ends of a distribution of outcomes—have tremendousinfluence in finance, where a small number of events can account forthe majority of outcomes.\nThat can be hard to deal with, even if you understand the math. It isnot intuitive that an investor can be wrong half the time and stillmake a fortune. It means we underestimate how normal it is for a lotof things to fail. Which causes us to overreact when they do.\n \n \nSteamboat Willie put Walt Disney on the map as an animator.Business success was another story. Disney’s first studio wentbankrupt. His films were monstrously expensive to produce, andfinanced at outrageous terms. By the mid-1930s Disney hadproduced more than 400 cartoons. Most of them were short, most ofthem were beloved by viewers, and most of them lost a fortune.\nSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs changed everything.\nThe $8 million it earned in the first six months of 1938 was an orderof magnitude higher than anything the company earned previously. Ittransformed Disney Studios. All company debts were paid off. Keyemployees got retention bonuses. The company purchased a newstate-of-the-art studio in Burbank, where it remains today. An Oscarturned Walt from famous to full-blown celebrity. By 1938 he hadproduced several hundred hours of film. But in business terms, the83 minutes of Snow White were all that mattered.\nAnything that is huge, profitable, famous, or influential is the resultof a tail event—an outlying one-in-thousands or millions event. Andmost of our attention goes to things that are huge, profitable,famous, or influential. When most of what we pay attention to is theresult of a tail, it’s easy to underestimate how rare and powerful theyare.\nSome tail-driven industries are obvious. Take venture capital. If aVC makes 50 investments they likely expect half of them to fail, 10to do pretty well, and one or two to be bonanzas that drive 100% ofthe fund’s returns. Investment firm Correlation Ventures once\ncrunched the numbers.² ⁰  Out of more than 21,000 venture financingsfrom 2004 to 2014:\n\f\n65% lost money.\nTwo and a half percent of investments made 10x–20x.\nOne percent made more than a 20x return.\nHalf a percent—about 100 companies out of 21,000—earned 50x ormore. That’s where the majority of the industry’s returns come from.\nThis, you might think, is what makes venture capital so risky. Andeveryone investing in VC knows it’s risky. Most startups fail and theworld is only kind enough to allow a few mega successes.\nIf you want safer, predictable, and more stable returns, you invest inlarge public companies.\nOr so you might think.\nRemember, tails drive everything.\nThe distribution of success among large public stocks over time isnot much different than it is in venture capital.\nMost public companies are duds, a few do well, and a handfulbecome extraordinary winners that account for the majority of thestock market’s returns.\nJ.P. Morgan Asset Management once published the distribution ofreturns for the Russell 3000 Index—a big, broad, collection ofpublic companies—since 1980.²¹\nForty percent of all Russell 3000 stock components lost at least 70%of their value and never recovered over this period.\nEffectively all of the index’s overall returns came from 7% ofcomponent companies that outperformed by at least two standarddeviations.\nThat’s the kind of thing you’d expect from venture capital. But it’swhat happened inside a boring, diversified index.\nThis thumping of most public companies spares no industry. Morethan half of all public technology and telecom companies lose mostof their value and never recover. Even among public utilities thefailure rate is more than 1 in 10:\n\f\nThe interesting thing here is that you have to have achieved a certainlevel of success to become a public company and a member of theRussell 3000. These are established corporations, not fly-by-nightstartups. Even still, most have lifespans measured in years, notgenerations.\nTake an example one of these companies: Carolco, a former memberof the Russell 3000 Index.\nIt produced some of the biggest films of the 1980s and 1990s,including the first three Rambo films, Terminator 2, Basic Instinct,and Total Recall.\nCarolco went public in 1987. It was a huge success, churning out hitafter hit. It did half a billion dollars in revenue in 1991, commandinga market cap of $400 million—big money back then, especially for afilm studio.\nAnd then it failed.\nThe blockbusters stopped, a few big-budget projects flopped, and bythe mid-1990s Carolco was history. It went bankrupt in 1996. Stock\n\f\ngoes to zero, have a nice day. A catastrophic loss. And one that 4 in10 public companies experience over time. Carolco’s story is notworth telling because it’s unique, but because it’s common.\nHere’s the most important part of this story: The Russell 3000 hasincreased more than 73-fold since 1980. That is a spectacular return.That is success.\nForty percent of the companies in the index were effectively failures.But the 7% of components that performed extremely well were morethan enough to offset the duds. Just like Heinz Berggruen, but withMicrosoft and Walmart instead of Picasso and Matisse.\nNot only do a few companies account for most of the market’sreturn, but within those companies are even more tail events.\nIn 2018, Amazon drove 6% of the S&P 500’s returns. AndAmazon’s growth is almost entirely due to Prime and Amazon WebServices, which itself are tail events in a company that hasexperimented with hundreds of products, from the Fire Phone totravel agencies.\nApple was responsible for almost 7% of the index’s returns in 2018.And it is driven overwhelmingly by the iPhone, which in the worldof tech products is as tail-y as tails get.\nAnd who’s working at these companies? Google’s hiring acceptance\nrate is 0.2%.²² Facebook’s is 0.1%.²³ Apple’s is about 2%.² ⁴  So thepeople working on these tail projects that drive tail returns have tailcareers.\nThe idea that a few things account for most results is not just true forcompanies in your investment portfolio. It’s also an important part ofyour own behavior as an investor.\nNapoleon’s definition of a military genius was, “The man who cando the average thing when all those around him are going crazy.”\nIt’s the same in investing.\nMost financial advice is about today. What should you do right now,and what stocks look like good buys today?\nBut most of the time today is not that important. Over the course ofyour lifetime as an investor the decisions that you make today ortomorrow or next week will not matter nearly as much as what youdo during the small number of days—likely 1% of the time or less—when everyone else around you is going crazy.\n\f\nConsider what would happen if you saved $1 every month from1900 to 2019.\nYou could invest that $1 into the U.S. stock market every month,rain or shine. It doesn’t matter if economists are screaming about alooming recession or new bear market. You just keep investing.Let’s call an investor who does this Sue.\nBut maybe investing during a recession is too scary. So perhaps youinvest your $1 in the stock market when the economy is not in arecession, sell everything when it’s in a recession and save yourmonthly dollar in cash, and invest everything back into the stockmarket when the recession ends. We’ll call this investor Jim.\nOr perhaps it takes a few months for a recession to scare you out,and then it takes a while to regain confidence before you get back inthe market. You invest $1 in stocks when there’s no recession, sellsix months after a recession begins, and invest back in six monthsafter a recession ends. We’ll call you Tom.\nHow much money would these three investors end up with overtime?\nSue ends up with $435,551.\nJim has $257,386.\nTom $234,476.\nSue wins by a mile.\nThere were 1,428 months between 1900 and 2019. Just over 300 ofthem were during a recession. So by keeping her cool during just the22% of the time the economy was in or near a recession, Sue endsup with almost three-quarters more money than Jim or Tom.\nTo give a more recent example: How you behaved as an investorduring a few months in late 2008 and early 2009 will likely havemore impact on your lifetime returns than everything you did from2000 to 2008.\nThere is the old pilot quip that their jobs are “hours and hours ofboredom punctuated by moments of sheer terror.” It’s the same ininvesting. Your success as an investor will be determined by howyou respond to punctuated moments of terror, not the years spent oncruise control.\nA good definition of an investing genius is the man or woman whocan do the average thing when all those around them are goingcrazy."

    "raw_text": "Tails drive everything.\n \n \nWhen you accept that tails drive everything in business, investing,and finance you realize that it’s normal for lots of things to gowrong, break, fail, and fall.\nIf you’re a good stock picker you’ll be right maybe half the time.\nIf you’re a good business leader maybe half of your product andstrategy ideas will work.\nIf you’re a good investor most years will be just OK, and plenty willbe bad.\nIf you’re a good worker you’ll find the right company in the rightfield after several attempts and trials.\nAnd that’s if you’re good.\nPeter Lynch is one of the best investors of our time. “If you’reterrific in this business, you’re right six times out of 10,” he oncesaid.\nThere are fields where you must be perfect every time. Flying aplane, for example. Then there are fields where you want to be atleast pretty good nearly all the time. A restaurant chef, let’s say.\nInvesting, business, and finance are just not like these fields.\nSomething I’ve learned from both investors and entrepreneurs is thatno one makes good decisions all the time. The most impressivepeople are packed full of horrendous ideas that are often acted upon.\nTake Amazon. It’s not intuitive to think a failed product launch at amajor company would be normal and fine. Intuitively, you’d thinkthe CEO should apologize to shareholders. But CEO Jeff Bezos saidshortly after the disastrous launch of the company’s Fire Phone:\n \nIf you think that’s a big failure, we’re working on much biggerfailures right now. I am not kidding. Some of them are going tomake the Fire Phone look like a tiny little blip.\n \nIt’s OK for Amazon to lose a lot of money on the Fire Phonebecause it will be offset by something like Amazon Web Servicesthat earns tens of billions of dollars. Tails to the rescue.\n\f\nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings once announced his company wascanceling several big-budget productions. He responded:\n \nOur hit ratio is way too high right now. I’m always pushing thecontent team. We have to take more risk. You have to try more crazythings, because we should have a higher cancel rate overall.\n \nThese are not delusions or failures of responsibility. They are a smartacknowledgement of how tails drive success. For every AmazonPrime or Orange is The New Black you know, with certainty, thatyou’ll have some duds.\nPart of why this isn’t intuitive is because in most fields we only seethe finished product, not the losses incurred that led to the tail-success product.\nThe Chris Rock I see on TV is hilarious, flawless. The Chris Rockthat performs in dozens of small clubs each year is just OK. That isby design. No comedic genius is smart enough to preemptivelyknow what jokes will land well. Every big comedian tests theirmaterial in small clubs before using it in big venues. Rock was onceasked if he missed small clubs. He responded:\n \nWhen I start a tour, it’s not like I start out in arenas. Before this lasttour I performed in this place in New Brunswick called the StressFactory. I did about 40 or 50 shows getting ready for the tour.\n \nOne newspaper profiled these small-club sessions. It described Rockthumbing through pages of notes and fumbling with material. “I’mgoing to have to cut some of these jokes,” he says mid-skit. Thegood jokes I see on Netflix are the tails that stuck out of a universeof hundreds of attempts.\nA similar thing happens in investing. It’s easy to find WarrenBuffett’s net worth, or his average annual returns. Or even his best,most notable investments. They’re right there in the open, andthey’re what people talk about.\nIt’s much harder to piece together every investment he’s made overhis career. No one talks about the dud picks, the ugly businesses, thepoor acquisitions. But they’re a big part of Buffett’s story. They arethe other side of tail-driven returns."

But it’s possible we are wrong, or just sortof right, just as often as the masters are. They may have been moreright when they were right, but they could have been wrong just asoften as you.\n“It’s not whether you’re right or wrong that’s important,” GeorgeSoros once said, “but how much money you make when you’re rightand how much you lose when you’re wrong.” You can be wrong halfthe time and still make a fortune.\n \n \nThere are 100 billion planets in our galaxy and only one, as far as weknow, with intelligent life.\nThe fact that you are reading this book is the result of the longest tailyou can imagine.\nThat’s something to be happy about.

    "raw_text": "The highest form of wealth is the ability to wake up every\nmorning and say, “I can do whatever I want today.”\nPeople want to become wealthier to make them happier.\nHappiness is a complicated subject because everyone’s\ndifferent. But if there’s a common denominator in happiness—\na universal fuel of joy—it’s that people want to control their\nlives.\nThe ability to do what you want, when you want, with who\nyou want, for as long as you want, is priceless. It is the highest\ndividend money pays.\n \n \nAngus Campbell was a psychologist at the University of\nMichigan. Born in 1910, his research took place during an age\nwhen psychology was overwhelmingly focused on disorders\nthat brought people down—things like depression, anxiety,\nschizophrenia.\nCampbell wanted to know what made people happy. His 1981\nbook, The Sense of Wellbeing in America, starts by pointing\nout that people are generally happier than many psychologists\nassumed. But some were clearly doing better than others. And\nyou couldn’t necessarily group them by income, or geography,\nor education, because so many in each of those categories end\nup chronically unhappy.\nThe most powerful common denominator of happiness was\nsimple. Campbell summed it up:\n \nHaving a strong sense of controlling one’s life is a more\ndependable predictor of positive feelings of wellbeing than\nany of the objective conditions of life we have considered.\n \nMore than your salary. More than the size of your house. More\nthan the prestige of your job. Control over doing what you\nwant, when you want to, with the people you want to, is the\nbroadest lifestyle variable that makes people happy.\n\f\nMoney’s greatest intrinsic value—and this can’t be overstated\n—is its ability to give you control over your time. To obtain,\nbit by bit, a level of independence and autonomy that comes\nfrom unspent assets that give you greater control over what\nyou can do and when you can do it.\nA small amount of wealth means the ability to take a few days\noff work when you’re sick without breaking the bank. Gaining\nthat ability is huge if you don’t have it.\nA bit more means waiting for a good job to come around after\nyou get laid off, rather than having to take the first one you\nfind. That can be life changing.\nSix months’ emergency expenses means not being terrified of\nyour boss, because you know you won’t be ruined if you have\nto take some time off to find a new job.\nMore still means the ability to take a job with lower pay but\nflexible hours. Maybe one with a shorter commute. Or being\nable to deal with a medical emergency without the added\nburden of worrying about how you’ll pay for it.\nThen there’s retiring when you want to, instead of when you\nneed to.\nUsing your money to buy time and options has a lifestyle\nbenefit few luxury goods can compete with.\nThroughout college I wanted to be an investment banker.\nThere was only one reason why: they made a lot of money.\nThat was the only drive, and one I was 100% positive would\nmake me happier once I got it. I scored a summer internship at\nan investment bank in Los Angeles in my junior year, and\nthought I won the career lottery. This is all I ever wanted.\nOn my first day I realized why investment bankers make a lot\nof money: They work longer and more controlled hours than I\nknew humans could handle. Actually, most can’t handle it.\nGoing home before midnight was considered a luxury, and\nthere was a saying in the office: “If you don’t come to work on\nSaturday, don’t bother coming back on Sunday.” The job was\nintellectually stimulating, paid well, and made me feel\nimportant.

    "raw_text": "slave to my boss’s demands, which was enough to turn it into\none of the most miserable experiences of my life. It was a\nfour-month internship. I lasted a month.\nThe hardest thing about this was that I loved the work. And I\nwanted to work hard. But doing something you love on a\nschedule you can’t control can feel the same as doing\nsomething you hate.\nThere is a name for this feeling. Psychologists call it\nreactance. Jonah Berger, a marketing professor at the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, summed it up well:\n \nPeople like to feel like they’re in control—in the drivers’ seat.\nWhen we try to get them to do something, they feel\ndisempowered. Rather than feeling like they made the choice,\nthey feel like we made it for them. So they say no or do\nsomething else, even when they might have originally been\nhappy to go along.² ⁵\n \nWhen you accept how true that statement is, you realize that\naligning money towards a life that lets you do what you want,\nwhen you want, with who you want, where you want, for as\nlong as you want, has incredible return.\nDerek Sivers, a successful entrepreneur, once wrote about a\nfriend who asked him to tell the story about how he got rich:\n \nI had a day job in midtown Manhattan paying $20\nk\nper year—about minimum wage … I never ate out, and never\ntook a taxi. My cost of living was about $1000/month, and I\nwas earning $1800/month. I did this for two years, and saved\nup $12,000. I was 22 years old.\nOnce I had $12,000 I could quit my job and become a full-\ntime musician. I knew I could get a few gigs per month to pay\nmy cost of living. So I was free. I quit my job a month later,\nand never had a job again.\n\f\nWhen I finished telling my friend this story, he asked for more.\nI said no, that was it. He said, “No, what about when you sold\nyour company?”\nI said no, that didn’t make a big difference in my life. That\nwas just more money in the bank. The difference happened\nwhen I was 22.² ⁶\n \n \nThe United States is the richest nation in the history of the\nworld. But there is little evidence that its citizens are, on\naverage, happier today than they were in the 1950s, when\nwealth and income were much lower—even at the median\nlevel and adjusted for inflation. A 2019 Gallup poll of 150,000\npeople in 140 countries found that about 45% of Americans\nsaid they felt “a lot of worry” the previous day.² ⁷  The global\naverage was 39%. Fifty-five percent of Americans said they\nfelt “a lot of stress” the previous day. For the rest of the world,\n35% said the same.\nPart of what’s happened here is that we’ve used our greater\nwealth to buy bigger and better stuff. But we’ve\nsimultaneously given up more control over our time. At best,\nthose things cancel each other out.\nMedian family income adjusted for inflation was $29,000 in\n1955.² ⁸  In 2019 it was just over $62,000. We’ve used that\nwealth to live a life hardly conceivable to the 1950s American,\neven for a median family. The median American home\nincreased from 983 square feet in 1950 to 2,436 square feet in\n2018. The average new American home now has more\nbathrooms than occupants. Our cars are faster and more\nefficient, our TVs are cheaper and sharper.\nWhat’s happened to our time, on the other hand, barely looks\nlike progress. And a lot of the reason has to do with the kind of\njobs more of us now have.\nJohn D. Rockefeller was one of the most successful\nbusinessmen of all time. He was also a recluse, spending most\nof his time by himself. He rarely spoke, deliberately making\n\f\nhimself inaccessible and staying quiet when you caught his\nattention.\nA refinery worker who occasionally had Rockefeller’s ear\nonce remarked: “He lets everybody else talk, while he sits\nback and says nothing.”\nWhen asked about his silence during meetings, Rockefeller\noften recited a poem:\n \nA wise old owl lived in an oak,\nThe more he saw the less he spoke,\nThe less he spoke, the more he heard,\nWhy aren’t we all like that wise old bird?\n \nRockefeller was a strange guy. But he figured out something\nthat now applies to tens of millions of workers.\nRockefeller’s job wasn’t to drill wells, load trains, or move\nbarrels. It was to think and make good decisions. Rockefeller’s\nproduct—his deliverable—wasn’t what he did with his hands,\nor even his words. It was what he figured out inside his head.\nSo that’s where he spent most of his time and energy. Despite\nsitting quietly most of the day in what might have looked like\nfree time or leisure hours to most people, he was constantly\nworking in his mind, thinking problems through.\nThis was unique in his day. Almost all jobs during\nRockefeller’s time required doing things with your hands. In\n1870, 46% of jobs were in agriculture, and 35% were in crafts\nor manufacturing, according to economist Robert Gordon. Few\nprofessions relied on a worker’s brain. You didn’t think; you\nlabored, without interruption, and your work was visible and\ntangible.\nToday, that’s flipped.\nThirty-eight percent of jobs are now designated as “managers,\nofficials, and professionals.” These are decision-making jobs.\nAnother 41% are service jobs that often rely on your thoughts\nas much as your actions.\n\f\nMore of us have jobs that look closer to Rockefeller than a\ntypical 1950s manufacturing worker, which means our days\ndon’t end when we clock out and leave the factory. We’re\nconstantly working in our heads, which means it feels like\nwork never ends.\nIf your job is to build cars, there is little you can do when\nyou’re not on the assembly line. You detach from work and\nleave your tools in the factory. But if your job is to create a\nmarketing campaign—a thought-based and decision job—your\ntool is your head, which never leaves you. You might be\nthinking about your project during your commute, as you’re\nmaking dinner, while you put your kids to sleep, and when you\nwake up stressed at three in the morning. You might be on the\nclock for fewer hours than you would in 1950. But it feels like\nyou’re working 24/7.\nDerek Thompson of The Atlantic once described it like this:\n \nIf the operating equipment of the 21st century is a portable\ndevice, this means the modern factory is not a place at all. It is\nthe day itself. The computer age has liberated the tools of\nproductivity from the office. Most knowledge workers, whose\nlaptops and smartphones are portable all-purpose media-\nmaking machines, can theoretically be as productive at 2 p.m.\nin the main office as at 2 a.m. in a Tokyo WeWork or at\nmidnight on the couch.² ⁹\n \nCompared to generations prior, control over your time has\ndiminished. And since controlling your time is such a key\nhappiness influencer, we shouldn’t be surprised that people\ndon’t feel much happier even though we are, on average,\nricher than ever.\nWhat do we do about that?\nIt’s not an easy problem to solve, because everyone’s different.\nThe first step is merely acknowledging what does, and does\nnot, make almost everyone happy."

    "raw_text": "In his book 30 Lessons for Living, gerontologist Karl Pillemer\ninterviewed a thousand elderly Americans looking for the\nmost important lessons they learned from decades of life\nexperience. He wrote:\n \nNo one—not a single person out of a thousand—said that to be\nhappy you should try to work as hard as you can to make\nmoney to buy the things you want.\nNo one—not a single person—said it’s important to be at least\nas wealthy as the people around you, and if you have more\nthan they do it’s real success.\nNo one—not a single person—said you should choose your\nwork based on your desired future earning power.\n \nWhat they did value were things like quality friendships, being\npart of something bigger than themselves, and spending\nquality, unstructured time with their children. “Your kids don’t\nwant your money (or what your money buys) anywhere near\nas much as they want you. Specifically, they want you with\nthem,” Pillemer writes.\nTake it from those who have lived through everything:\nControlling your time is the highest dividend money pays.\nNow, a short chapter on one of the lowest dividends money\npays.\n\f\n\n\f\nThe best part of being a valet is getting to drive some of the\ncoolest cars to ever touch pavement. Guests came in driving\nFerraris, Lamborghinis, Rolls-Royces—the whole aristocratic\nfleet.\nIt was my dream to have one of these cars of my own, because\n(I thought) they sent such a strong signal to others that you\nmade it. You’re smart. You’re rich. You have taste. You’re\nimportant. Look at me.\nThe irony is that I rarely if ever looked at them, the drivers.\nWhen you see someone driving a nice car, you rarely think,\n“Wow, the guy driving that car is cool.” Instead, you think,\n“Wow, if I had that car people would think I’m cool.”\nSubconscious or not, this is how people think.\nThere is a paradox here: people tend to want wealth to signal\nto others that they should be liked and admired. But in reality\nthose other people often bypass admiring you, not because\nthey don’t think wealth is admirable, but because they use\nyour wealth as a benchmark for their own desire to be liked\nand admired.\nThe letter I wrote after my son was born said, “You might\nthink you want an expensive car, a fancy watch, and a huge\nhouse. But I’m telling you, you don’t. What you want is\nrespect and admiration from other people, and you think\nhaving expensive stuff will bring it. It almost never does—\nespecially from the people you want to respect and admire\nyou.”\nI learned that as a valet, when I began thinking about all the\npeople driving up to the hotel in their Ferraris, watching me\ngawk. People must gawk everywhere they went, and I’m sure\nthey loved it. I’m sure they felt admired.\nBut did they know I did not care about them, or even notice\nthem? Did they know I was only gawking at the car, and\nimagining myself in the driver’s seat?\nDid they buy a Ferrari thinking it would bring them admiration\nwithout realizing that I—and likely most others—who are\n\f\nimpressed with the car didn’t actually give them, the driver, a\nmoment’s thought?\nDoes this same idea apply to those living in big homes?\nAlmost certainly.\nJewelry and clothes? Yep.\nMy point here is not to abandon the pursuit of wealth. Or even\nfancy cars. I like both.\nIt’s a subtle recognition that people generally aspire to be\nrespected and admired by others, and using money to buy\nfancy things may bring less of it than you imagine. If respect\nand admiration are your goal, be careful how you seek it.\nHumility, kindness, and empathy will bring you more respect\nthan horsepower ever will.\nWe’re not done talking about Ferraris. Another story about the\nparadox of fast cars in the next chapter.\n\f\n\n\f\nMoney has many ironies. Here’s an important one: Wealth is\nwhat you don’t see.\nMy time as a valet was in the mid-2000s in Los Angeles, when\nmaterial appearance took precedence over everything but\noxygen.\nIf you see a Ferrari driving around, you might intuitively\nassume the owner of the car is rich—even if you’re not paying\nmuch attention to them. But as I got to know some of these\npeople I realized that wasn’t always the case. Many were\nmediocre successes who spent a huge percentage of their\npaycheck on a car.\nI remember a fellow we’ll call Roger. He was about my age. I\nhad no idea what Roger did. But he drove a Porsche, which\nwas enough for people to draw assumptions.\nThen one day Roger arrived in an old Honda. Same the next\nweek, and the next.\n“What happened to your Porsche?” I asked. It was repossessed\nafter defaulting on his car loan, he said. There was not a\nmorsel of shame. He responded like he was telling the next\nplay in the game. Every assumption you might have had about\nhim was wrong. Los Angeles is full of Rogers.\nSomeone driving a $100,000 car might be wealthy. But the\nonly data point you have about their wealth is that they have\n$100,000 less than they did before they bought the car (or\n$100,000 more in debt). That’s all you know about them.\nWe tend to judge wealth by what we see, because that’s the\ninformation we have in front of us. We can’t see people’s bank\naccounts or brokerage statements. So we rely on outward\nappearances to gauge financial success. Cars. Homes.\nInstagram photos.\nModern capitalism makes helping people fake it until they\nmake it a cherished industry.\nBut the truth is that wealth is what you don’t see.\nWealth is the nice cars not purchased. The diamonds not\nbought. The watches not worn, the clothes forgone and the\n\f\nfirst-class upgrade declined. Wealth is financial assets that\nhaven’t yet been converted into the stuff you see.\nThat’s not how we think about wealth, because you can’t\ncontextualize what you can’t see.\nSinger Rihanna nearly went bankrupt after overspending and\nsued her financial advisor. The advisor responded: “Was it\nreally necessary to tell her that if you spend money on things,\nyou will end up with the things and not the money?”³ ⁰\nYou can laugh, and please do. But the answer is, yes, people\ndo need to be told that. When most people say they want to be\na millionaire, what they might actually mean is “I’d like to\nspend a million dollars.” And that is literally the opposite of\nbeing a millionaire.\nInvestor Bill Mann once wrote: “There is no faster way to feel\nrich than to spend lots of money on really nice things. But the\nway to be rich is to spend money you have, and to not spend\nmoney you don’t have. It’s really that simple.”³¹\nIt is excellent advice, but it may not go far enough. The only\nway to be wealthy is to not spend the money that you do have.\nIt’s not just the only way to accumulate wealth; it’s the very\ndefinition of wealth.\nWe should be careful to define the difference between wealthy\nand rich. It is more than semantics. Not knowing the\ndifference is a source of countless poor money decisions.\nRich is a current income. Someone driving a $100,000 car is\nalmost certainly rich, because even if they purchased the car\nwith debt you need a certain level of income to afford the\nmonthly payment. Same with those who live in big homes. It’s\nnot hard to spot rich people. They often go out of their way to\nmake themselves known.\nBut wealth is hidden. It’s income not spent. Wealth is an\noption not yet taken to buy something later. Its value lies in\noffering you options, flexibility, and growth to one day\npurchase more stuff than you could right now.\nDiet and exercise offer a useful analogy. Losing weight is\nnotoriously hard, even among those putting in the work of\n\f\nvigorous exercise. In his book The Body, Bill Bryson explains\nwhy:\n \nOne study in America found that people overestimate the\nnumber of calories they burned in a workout by a factor of\nfour. They also then consumed, on average, about twice as\nmany calories as they had just burned off … the fact is, you\ncan quickly undo a lot of exercise by eating a lot of food, and\nmost of us do.\n \nExercise is like being rich. You think, “I did the work and I\nnow deserve to treat myself to a big meal.” Wealth is turning\ndown that treat meal and actually burning net calories. It’s\nhard, and requires self-control. But it creates a gap between\nwhat you could do and what you choose to do that accrues to\nyou over time.\nThe problem for many of us is that it is easy to find rich role\nmodels. It’s harder to find wealthy ones because by definition\ntheir success is more hidden.\nThere are, of course, wealthy people who also spend a lot of\nmoney on stuff. But even in those cases what we see is their\nrichness, not their wealth. We see the cars they chose to buy\nand perhaps the school they choose to send their kids to. We\ndon’t see the savings, retirement accounts, or investment\nportfolios. We see the homes they bought, not the homes they\ncould have bought had they stretched themselves thin.\nThe danger here is that I think most people, deep down, want\nto be wealthy. They want freedom and flexibility, which is\nwhat financial assets not yet spent can give you. But it is so\ningrained in us that to have money is to spend money that we\ndon’t get to see the restraint it takes to actually be wealthy.\nAnd since we can’t see it, it’s hard to learn about it.\nPeople are good at learning by imitation. But the hidden nature\nof wealth makes it hard to imitate others and learn from their\nways. After he died, Ronald Read became many people’s\nfinancial role model. He was lionized in the media and\ncherished on social media. But he was nobody’s financial role"

    "raw_text": "model while he was living because every penny of his wealth\nwas hidden, even to those who knew him.\nImagine how hard it would be to learn how to write if you\ncouldn’t read the works of great authors. Who would be your\ninspiration? Who would you admire? Whose nuanced tricks\nand tips would you follow? It would make something that is\nalready hard even harder. It’s difficult to learn from what you\ncan’t see. Which helps explain why it’s so hard for many to\nbuild wealth.\nThe world is filled with people who look modest but are\nactually wealthy and people who look rich who live at the\nrazor’s edge of insolvency. Keep this in mind when quickly\njudging others’ success and setting your own goals.\n \n \nIf wealth is what you don’t spend, what good is it? Well, let\nme convince you to save money.\n\f\n\n\f\nLet me convince you to save money.\nIt won’t take long.\nBut it’s an odd task, isn’t it?\nDo people need to be convinced to save money?\nMy observation is that, yes, many do.\nPast a certain level of income people fall into three groups:\nThose who save, those who don’t think they can save, and\nthose who don’t think they need to save.\nThis is for the latter two.\n \n \nThe first idea—simple, but easy to overlook—is that\nbuilding wealth has little to do with your income or\ninvestment returns, and lots to do with your savings rate.\n \nA quick story about the power of efficiency.\nIn the 1970s the world looked like it was running out of oil.\nThe calculation wasn’t hard: The global economy used a lot of\noil, the global economy was growing, and the amount of oil\nwe could drill couldn’t keep up.\nWe didn’t run out of oil, thank goodness. But that wasn’t just\nbecause we found more oil, or even got better at taking it out\nof the ground.\nThe biggest reason we overcame the oil crisis is because we\nstarted building cars, factories, and homes that are more\nenergy efficient than they used to be. The United States uses\n60% less energy per dollar of GDP today than it did in 1950.³²\nThe average miles per gallon of all vehicles on the road has\ndoubled since 1975. A 1989 Ford Taurus (sedan) averaged\n18.0 MPG. A 2019 Chevy Suburban (absurdly large SUV)\naverages 18.1 MPG.\nThe world grew its “energy wealth” not by increasing the\nenergy it had, but by decreasing the energy it needed. U.S. oil\n\f\nand gas production has increased 65% since 1975, while\nconservation and efficiency has more than doubled what we\ncan do with that energy. So it’s easy to see which has mattered\nmore.\nThe important thing here is that finding more energy is largely\nout of our control and shrouded in uncertainty, because it relies\non a slippery mix of having the right geology, geography,\nweather, and geopolitics. But becoming more efficient with the\nenergy we use is largely in our control. The decision to buy a\nlighter car or ride a bike is up to you and has a 100% chance of\nimproving efficiency.\nThe same is true with our money.\nInvestment returns can make you rich. But whether an\ninvesting strategy will work, and how long it will work for,\nand whether markets will cooperate, is always in doubt.\nResults are shrouded in uncertainty.\nPersonal savings and frugality—finance’s conservation and\nefficiency—are parts of the money equation that are more in\nyour control and have a 100% chance of being as effective in\nthe future as they are today.\nIf you view building wealth as something that will require\nmore money or big investment returns, you may become as\npessimistic as the energy doomers were in the 1970s. The path\nforward looks hard and out of your control.\nIf you view it as powered by your own frugality and\nefficiency, the destiny is clearer.\nWealth is just the accumulated leftovers after you spend what\nyou take in. And since you can build wealth without a high\nincome, but have no chance of building wealth without a high\nsavings rate, it’s clear which one matters more.\n \nMore importantly, the value of wealth is relative to what\nyou need.\n \nSay you and I have the same net worth.\n\f\nAnd say you’re a better investor than me. I can earn 8% annual\nreturns and you can earn 12% annual returns.\nBut I’m more efficient with my money. Let’s say I need half as\nmuch money to be happy while your lifestyle compounds as\nfast as your assets.\nI’m better off than you are, despite being a worse investor. I’m\ngetting more benefit from my investments despite lower\nreturns.\nThe same is true for incomes. Learning to be happy with less\nmoney creates a gap between what you have and what you\nwant—similar to the gap you get from growing your\npaycheck, but easier and more in your control.\nA high savings rate means having lower expenses than you\notherwise could, and having lower expenses means your\nsavings go farther than they would if you spent more.\nThink about this in the context of how much time and effort\ngoes into achieving 0.1% of annual investment\noutperformance—millions of hours of research, tens of\nbillions of dollars of effort from professionals—and it’s easy\nto see what’s potentially more important or worth chasing.\nThere are professional investors who grind 80 hours a week to\nadd a tenth of a percentage point to their returns when there\nare two or three full percentage points of lifestyle bloat in their\nfinances that can be exploited with less effort.\nBig investment returns and fat paychecks are amazing when\nthey can be achieved, and some can achieve them. But the fact\nthat there’s so much effort put into one side of the finance\nequation and so little put into the other is an opportunity for\nmost people.\n \nPast a certain level of income, what you need is just what\nsits below your ego.\n \nEveryone needs the basics. Once they’re covered there’s\nanother level of comfortable basics, and past that there’s basics\n\f\nthat are both comfortable, entertaining, and enlightening.\nBut spending beyond a pretty low level of materialism is\nmostly a reflection of ego approaching income, a way to spend\nmoney to show people that you have (or had) money.\nThink of it like this, and one of the most powerful ways to\nincrease your savings isn’t to raise your income. It’s to raise\nyour humility.\nWhen you define savings as the gap between your ego and\nyour income you realize why many people with decent\nincomes save so little. It’s a daily struggle against instincts to\nextend your peacock feathers to their outermost limits and\nkeep up with others doing the same.\nPeople with enduring personal finance success—not\nnecessarily those with high incomes—tend to have a\npropensity to not give a damn what others think about them.\n \nSo people’s ability to save is more in their control than they\nmight think.\n \nSavings can be created by spending less.\nYou can spend less if you desire less.\nAnd you will desire less if you care less about what others\nthink of you.\nAs I argue often in this book, money relies more on\npsychology than finance.\n \nAnd you don’t need a specific reason to save.\n \nSome people save money for a downpayment on a house, or a\nnew car, or for retirement.\nThat’s great, of course.\nBut saving does not require a goal of purchasing something\nspecific."

    "raw_text": "You can save just for saving’s sake. And indeed you should.\nEveryone should.\nOnly saving for a specific goal makes sense in a predictable\nworld. But ours isn’t. Saving is a hedge against life’s\ninevitable ability to surprise the hell out of you at the worst\npossible moment.\nAnother benefit of savings that isn’t attached to a spending\ngoal is what we discussed in chapter 7: gaining control over\nyour time.\nEveryone knows the tangible stuff money buys. The intangible\nstuff is harder to wrap your head around, so it tends to go\nunnoticed. But the intangible benefits of money can be far\nmore valuable and capable of increasing your happiness than\nthe tangible things that are obvious targets of our savings.\nSavings without a spending goal gives you options and\nflexibility, the ability to wait and the opportunity to pounce. It\ngives you time to think. It lets you change course on your own\nterms.\nEvery bit of savings is like taking a point in the future that\nwould have been owned by someone else and giving it back to\nyourself.\n \nThat flexibility and control over your time is an unseen\nreturn on wealth.\n \nWhat is the return on cash in the bank that gives you the\noption of changing careers, or retiring early, or freedom from\nworry?\nI’d say it’s incalculable.\nIt’s incalculable in two ways. It’s so large and important that\nwe can’t put a price on it. But it’s also literally incalculable—\nwe can’t measure it like we can measure interest rates—and\nwhat we can’t measure we tend to overlook.\nWhen you don’t have control over your time, you’re forced to\naccept whatever bad luck is thrown your way. But if you have\n\f\nflexibility you have the time to wait for no-brainer\nopportunities to fall in your lap. This is a hidden return on\nyour savings.\nSavings in the bank that earn 0% interest might actually\ngenerate an extraordinary return if they give you the flexibility\nto take a job with a lower salary but more purpose, or wait for\ninvestment opportunities that come when those without\nflexibility turn desperate.\n \nAnd that hidden return is becoming more important.\n \nThe world used to be hyper-local. Just over 100 years ago 75%\nof Americans had neither telephones nor regular mail service,\naccording to historian Robert Gordon. That made competition\nhyper-local. A worker with just average intelligence might be\nthe best in their town, and they got treated like the best\nbecause they didn’t have to compete with the smarter worker\nin another town.\nThat’s now changed.\nA hyper-connected world means the talent pool you compete\nin has gone from hundreds or thousands spanning your town to\nmillions or billions spanning the globe. This is especially true\nfor jobs that rely on working with your head versus your\nmuscles: teaching, marketing, analysis, consulting, accounting,\nprogramming, journalism, and even medicine increasingly\ncompete in global talent pools. More fields will fall into this\ncategory as digitization erases global boundaries—as\n“software eats the world,” as venture capitalist Marc\nAndreesen puts it.\nA question you should ask as the range of your competition\nexpands is, “How do I stand out?”\n“I’m smart” is increasingly a bad answer to that question,\nbecause there are a lot of smart people in the world. Almost\n600 people ace the SATs each year. Another 7,000 come\nwithin a handful of points. In a winner-take-all and globalized\n\f\nworld these kinds of people are increasingly your direct\ncompetitors.\nIntelligence is not a reliable advantage in a world that’s\nbecome as connected as ours has.\nBut flexibility is.\nIn a world where intelligence is hyper-competitive and many\nprevious technical skills have become automated, competitive\nadvantages tilt toward nuanced and soft skills—like\ncommunication, empathy, and, perhaps most of all, flexibility.\nIf you have flexibility you can wait for good opportunities,\nboth in your career and for your investments. You’ll have a\nbetter chance of being able to learn a new skill when it’s\nnecessary. You’ll feel less urgency to chase competitors who\ncan do things you can’t, and have more leeway to find your\npassion and your niche at your own pace. You can find a new\nroutine, a slower pace, and think about life with a different set\nof assumptions. The ability to do those things when most\nothers can’t is one of the few things that will set you apart in a\nworld where intelligence is no longer a sustainable advantage.\nHaving more control over your time and options is becoming\none of the most valuable currencies in the world.\nThat’s why more people can, and more people should, save\nmoney.\nYou know what else they should do? Stop trying to be so\nrational. Let me tell you why.\n\f\n\n\f\nYou’re not a spreadsheet. You’re a person. A screwed up,\nemotional person.\nIt took me a while to figure this out, but once it clicked I\nrealized it’s one of the most important parts of finance.\nWith it comes something that often goes overlooked: Do not\naim to be coldly rational when making financial decisions.\nAim to just be pretty reasonable. Reasonable is more realistic\nand you have a better chance of sticking with it for the long\nrun, which is what matters most when managing money.\nTo show you what I mean, let me tell you the story of a guy\nwho tried to cure syphilis with malaria.\n \n \nJulius Wagner-Jauregg was a 19th-century psychiatrist with\ntwo unique skills: He was good at recognizing patterns, and\nwhat others saw as “crazy” he found merely “bold.”\nHis specialty was patients with severe neurosyphilis—then a\nfatal diagnosis with no known treatment. He began noticing a\npattern: syphilis patients tended to recover if they had the\nadded misfortune of having prolonged fevers from an\nunrelated ailment.\nWagner-Jauregg assumed this was due to a hunch that had\nbeen around for centuries but doctors didn’t understand well:\nfevers play a role in helping the body fight infection.\nSo he jumped to the logical conclusion.\nIn the early 1900s Wagner-Jauregg began injecting patients\nwith low-end strains of typhoid, malaria, and smallpox to\ntrigger fevers strong enough to kill off their syphilis. This was\nas dangerous as it sounds. Some of his patients died from the\ntreatment. He eventually settled on a weak version of malaria,\nsince it could be effectively countered with quinine after a few\ndays of bone-rattling fevers.\nAfter some tragic trial and error his experiment worked.\nWagner-Jauregg reported that 6 in 10 syphilis patients treated\nwith “malariotherapy” recovered, compared to around 3 in 10\n\f\npatients left alone. He won the Nobel Prize in medicine in\n1927. The organization today notes: “The main work that\nconcerned Wagner-Jauregg throughout his working life was\nthe endeavour to cure mental disease by inducing a fever.”³³\nPenicillin eventually made malariotherapy for syphilis patients\nobsolete, thank goodness. But Wagner-Jauregg is one of the\nonly doctors in history who not only recognized fever’s role in\nfighting infection, but also prescribed it as a treatment.\nFevers have always been as feared as they are mysterious.\nAncient Romans worshiped Febris, the Goddess who protected\npeople from fevers. Amulets were left at temples to placate\nher, hoping to stave off the next round of shivers.\nBut Wagner-Jauregg was onto something. Fevers are not\naccidental nuisances. They do play a role in the body’s road to\nrecovery. We now have better, more scientific evidence of\nfever’s usefulness in fighting infection. A one-degree increase\nin body temperature has been shown to slow the replication\nrate of some viruses by a factor of 200. “Numerous\ninvestigators have identified a better outcome among patients\nwho displayed fever,” one NIH paper writes.³ ⁴  The Seattle\nChildren’s Hospital includes a section on its website to educate\nparents who may panic at the slightest rise in their child’s\ntemperature: “Fevers turn on the body’s immune system. They\nhelp the body fight infection. Normal fevers between 100° and\n104° f are good for sick children.”³ ⁵\nBut that’s where the science ends and reality takes over.\nFever is almost universally seen as a bad thing. They’re treated\nwith drugs like Tylenol to reduce them as quickly as they\nappear. Despite millions of years of evolution as a defense\nmechanism, no parent, no patient, few doctors, and certainly\nno drug company views fever as anything but a misfortune\nthat should be eliminated.\nThese views do not match the known science. One study was\nblunt: “Treatment of fever is common in the ICU setting and\nlikely related to standard dogma rather than evidence-based\npractice.”³ ⁶  Howard Markel, director of the Center for the\nHistory of Medicine, once said of fever phobia: “These are\n\f\ncultural practices that spread just as widely as the infectious\ndiseases that are behind them.”³ ⁷\nWhy does this happen? If fevers are beneficial, why do we\nfight them so universally?\nI don’t think it’s complicated: Fevers hurt. And people don’t\nwant to hurt.\nThat’s it.\nA doctor’s goal is not just to cure disease. It’s to cure disease\nwithin the confines of what’s reasonable and tolerable to the\npatient. Fevers can have marginal benefits in fighting\ninfection, but they hurt. And I go to the doctor to stop hurting.\nI don’t care about double-blind studies when I’m shivering\nunder a blanket. If you have a pill that can make a fever stop,\ngive it to me now.\nIt may be rational to want a fever if you have an infection. But\nit’s not reasonable.\nThat philosophy—aiming to be reasonable instead of rational\n—is one more people should consider when making decisions\nwith their money.\n \n \nAcademic finance is devoted to finding the mathematically\noptimal investment strategies. My own theory is that, in the\nreal world, people do not want the mathematically optimal\nstrategy. They want the strategy that maximizes for how well\nthey sleep at night.\nHarry Markowitz won the Nobel Prize for exploring the\nmathematical tradeoff between risk and return. He was once\nasked how he invested his own money, and described his\nportfolio allocation in the 1950s, when his models were first\ndeveloped:\n \nI visualized my grief if the stock market went way up and I\nwasn’t in it—or if it went way down and I was completely in"

    "raw_text": "it. My intention was to minimize my future regret. So I split\nmy contributions 50/50 between bonds and equities.\n \nMarkowitz eventually changed his investment strategy,\ndiversifying the mix. But two things here are important.\nOne is that “minimizing future regret” is hard to rationalize on\npaper but easy to justify in real life. A rational investor makes\ndecisions based on numeric facts. A reasonable investor makes\nthem in a conference room surrounded by co-workers you\nwant to think highly of you, with a spouse you don’t want to\nlet down, or judged against the silly but realistic competitors\nthat are your brother-in-law, your neighbor, and your own\npersonal doubts. Investing has a social component that’s often\nignored when viewed through a strictly financial lens.\nThe second is that this is fine. Jason Zweig, who conducted the\ninterview when Markowitz described how he invested, later\nreflected:\n \nMy own view is that people are neither rational nor irrational.\nWe are human. We don’t like to think harder than we need to,\nand we have unceasing demands on our attention. Seen in that\nlight, there’s nothing surprising about the fact that the pioneer\nof modern portfolio theory built his initial portfolio with so\nlittle regard for his own research. Nor is it surprising that he\nadjusted it later.³ ⁸\n \nMarkowitz is neither rational or irrational. He’s reasonable.\nWhat’s often overlooked in finance is that something can be\ntechnically true but contextually nonsense.\nIn 2008 a pair of researchers from Yale published a study\narguing young savers should supercharge their retirement\naccounts using two-to-one margin (two dollars of debt for\nevery dollar of their own money) when buying stocks. It\nsuggests investors taper that leverage as they age, which lets a\nsaver take more risk when they’re young and can handle a\nmagnified market rollercoaster, and less when they’re older.\n\f\nEven if using leverage left you wiped out when you were\nyoung (if you use two-to-one margin a 50% market drop\nleaves you with nothing) the researchers showed savers would\nstill be better off in the long run so long as they picked\nthemselves back up, followed the plan, and kept saving in a\ntwo-to-one leveraged account the day after being wiped out.\nThe math works on paper. It’s a rational strategy.\nBut it’s almost absurdly unreasonable.\nNo normal person could watch 100% of their retirement\naccount evaporate and be so unphased that they carry on with\nthe strategy undeterred. They’d quit, look for a different\noption, and perhaps sue their financial advisor.\nThe researchers argued that when using their strategy “the\nexpected retirement wealth is 90% higher compared to life-\ncycle funds.” It is also 100% less reasonable.\n \n \nThere is, in fact, a rational reason to favor what look like\nirrational decisions.\nHere’s one: Let me suggest that you love your investments.\nThis is not traditional advice. It’s almost a badge of honor for\ninvestors to claim they’re emotionless about their investments,\nbecause it seems rational.\nBut if lacking emotions about your strategy or the stocks you\nown increases the odds you’ll walk away from them when\nthey become difficult, what looks like rational thinking\nbecomes a liability. The reasonable investors who love their\ntechnically imperfect strategies have an edge, because they’re\nmore likely to stick with those strategies.\nThere are few financial variables more correlated to\nperformance than commitment to a strategy during its lean\nyears—both the amount of performance and the odds of\ncapturing it over a given period of time. The historical odds of\nmaking money in U.S. markets are 50/50 over one-day\nperiods, 68% in one-year periods, 88% in 10-year periods, and\n\f\n(so far) 100% in 20-year periods. Anything that keeps you in\nthe game has a quantifiable advantage.\nIf you view “do what you love” as a guide to a happier life, it\nsounds like empty fortune cookie advice. If you view it as the\nthing providing the endurance necessary to put the quantifiable\nodds of success in your favor, you realize it should be the most\nimportant part of any financial strategy.\nInvest in a promising company you don’t care about, and you\nmight enjoy it when everything’s going well. But when the\ntide inevitably turns you’re suddenly losing money on\nsomething you’re not interested in. It’s a double burden, and\nthe path of least resistance is to move onto something else. If\nyou’re passionate about the company to begin with—you love\nthe mission, the product, the team, the science, whatever—the\ninevitable down times when you’re losing money or the\ncompany needs help are blunted by the fact that at least you\nfeel like you’re part of something meaningful. That can be the\nnecessary motivation that prevents you from giving up and\nmoving on.\nThere are several other times when it’s fine to be reasonable\ninstead of rational with money.\nThere’s a well-documented “home bias,” where people prefer\nto invest in companies from the country they live in while\nignoring the other 95%+ of the planet. It’s not rational, until\nyou consider that investing is effectively giving money to\nstrangers. If familiarity helps you take the leap of faith\nrequired to remain backing those strangers, it’s reasonable.\nDay trading and picking individual stocks is not rational for\nmost investors—the odds are heavily against your success. But\nthey’re both reasonable in small amounts if they scratch an\nitch hard enough to leave the rest of your more diversified\ninvestments alone. Investor Josh Brown, who advocates and\nmostly owns diversified funds, once explained why he also\nowns a smattering of individual stocks: “I’m not buying\nindividual stocks because I think I’m going to generate alpha\n[outperformance]. I just love stocks and have ever since I was\n20 years old. And it’s my money, I get to do whatever.” Quite\nreasonable.\n\f\nMost forecasts about where the economy and the stock market\nare heading next are terrible, but making forecasts is\nreasonable. It’s hard to wake up in the morning telling yourself\nyou have no clue what the future holds, even if it’s true.\nActing on investment forecasts is dangerous. But I get why\npeople try to predict what will happen next year. It’s human\nnature. It’s reasonable.\nJack Bogle, the late founder of Vanguard, spent his career on a\ncrusade to promote low-cost passive index investing. Many\nthought it interesting that his son found a career as an active,\nhigh-fee hedge fund and mutual fund manager. Bogle—the\nman who said high-fee funds violate “the humble rules of\narithmetic”—invested some of his own money in his son’s\nfunds. What’s the explanation?\n“We do some things for family reasons,” Bogle told The Wall\nStreet Journal. “If it’s not consistent, well, life isn’t always\nconsistent.”³ ⁹\nIndeed, it rarely is.\n\f\n\n\f\nStanford professor Scott Sagan once said something everyone whofollows the economy or investment markets should hang on theirwall: “Things that have never happened before happen all the time.”\nHistory is mostly the study of surprising events. But it is often usedby investors and economists as an unassailable guide to the future.\nDo you see the irony?\nDo you see the problem?\nIt is smart to have a deep appreciation for economic and investinghistory. History helps us calibrate our expectations, study wherepeople tend to go wrong, and offers a rough guide of what tends towork. But it is not, in any way, a map of the future.\nA trap many investors fall into is what I call “historians as prophets”fallacy: An overreliance on past data as a signal to future conditionsin a field where innovation and change are the lifeblood of progress.\nYou can’t blame investors for doing this. If you view investing as ahard science, history should be a perfect guide to the future.Geologists can look at a billion years of historical data and formmodels of how the earth behaves. So can meteorologists. Anddoctors—kidneys operate the same way in 2020 as they did in 1020.\nBut investing is not a hard science. It’s a massive group of peoplemaking imperfect decisions with limited information about thingsthat will have a massive impact on their wellbeing, which can makeeven smart people nervous, greedy and paranoid.\nRichard Feynman, the great physicist, once said, “Imagine howmuch harder physics would be if electrons had feelings.” Well,investors have feelings. Quite a few of them. That’s why it’s hard topredict what they’ll do next based solely on what they did in thepast.\nThe cornerstone of economics is that things change over time,because the invisible hand hates anything staying too good or toobad indefinitely. Investor Bill Bonner once described how Mr.Market works: “He’s got a ‘Capitalism at Work’ T-shirt on and asledgehammer in his hand.” Few things stay the same for very long,which means we can’t treat historians as prophets.\nThe most important driver of anything tied to money is the storiespeople tell themselves and the preferences they have for goods andservices. Those things don’t tend to sit still. They change withculture and generation. They’re always changing and always will."

In fact it rarely does, becauseexperience leads to overconfidence more than forecasting ability.\nInvestor Michael Batnick once explained this well. Confronted withthe argument that few investors are prepared for rising interest ratesbecause they’ve never experienced them—the last big period ofrising interest rates occurred almost 40 years ago—he argued that itdidn’t matter, because experiencing or even studying what happenedin the past might not serve as any guide to what will happen whenrates rise in the future:\n \nSo what? Will the current rate hike look like the last one, or the onebefore that? Will different asset classes behave similarly, the same,or the exact opposite?\nOn the one hand, people that have been investing through the eventsof 1987, 2000 and 2008 have experienced a lot of different markets.On the other hand, isn’t it possible that this experience can lead tooverconfidence? Failing to admit you’re wrong? Anchoring toprevious outcomes?\n \nTwo dangerous things happen when you rely too heavily oninvestment history as a guide to what’s going to happen next.\n \n1. You’ll likely miss the outlier events that move the needle themost.\n \nThe most important events in historical data are the big outliers, therecord-breaking events. They are what move the needle in theeconomy and the stock market. The Great Depression. World War II.The dot-com bubble. September 11th. The housing crash of the mid-2000s. A handful of outlier events play an enormous role becausethey influence so many unrelated events in their wake.\nFifteen billion people were born in the 19th and 20th centuries.

But almosteverything about the world today—from borders to technology tosocial norms—would be different if these seven people hadn’t lefttheir mark. Another way to put this is that 0.00000000004% ofpeople were responsible for perhaps the majority of the world’sdirection over the last century.\nThe same goes for projects, innovations, and events. Imagine the lastcentury without:\n \n \nThe Great Depression\n \nWorld War II\n \nThe Manhattan Project\n \nVaccines\n\f\nAntibiotics\n \nARPANET\n \nSeptember 11th\n \nThe fall of the Soviet Union\n \nHow many projects and events occurred in the 20th century?Billions, trillions—who knows. But those eight alone impacted theworld orders upon orders of magnitude more than others.\nThe thing that makes tail events easy to underappreciate is how easyit is to underestimate how things compound. How, for example, 9/11prompted the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, which helpeddrive the housing bubble, which led to the financial crisis, which ledto a poor jobs market, which led tens of millions to seek a collegeeducation, which led to $1.6 trillion in student loans with a 10.8%default rate. It’s not intuitive to link 19 hijackers to the currentweight of student loans, but that’s what happens in a world driven bya few outlier tail events.\nThe majority of what’s happening at any given moment in the globaleconomy can be tied back to a handful of past events that werenearly impossible to predict.\nThe most common plot of economic history is the role of surprises.The reason surprises occur is not because our models are wrong orour intelligence is low. It’s because the odds that Adolf Hitler’sparents argued on the evening nine months before he was born werethe same as them conceiving a child. Technology is hard to predictbecause Bill Gates may have died from polio if Jonas Salk gotcranky and gave up on his quest to find a vaccine. The reason wecouldn’t predict the student loan growth is because an airportsecurity guard may have confiscated a hijacker’s knife on 9/11.That’s all there is to it.\nThe problem is that we often use events like the Great Depressionand World War II to guide our views of things like worst-casescenarios when thinking about future investment returns. But thoserecord-setting events had no precedent when they occurred. So theforecaster who assumes the worst (and best) events of the past will\n\f\nmatch the worst (and best) events of the future is not followinghistory; they’re accidentally assuming that the history ofunprecedented events doesn’t apply to the future.\nNassim Taleb writes in his book Fooled By Randomness:\n \nIn Pharaonic Egypt … scribes tracked the high-water mark of theNile and used it as an estimate for a future worst-case scenario. Thesame can be seen in the Fukushima nuclear reactor, whichexperienced a catastrophic failure in 2011 when a tsunami struck. Ithad been built to withstand the worst past historical earthquake, withthe builders not imagining much worse—and not thinking that theworst past event had to be a surprise, as it had no precedent.\n \nThis is not a failure of analysis. It’s a failure of imagination.Realizing the future might not look anything like the past is a specialkind of skill that is not generally looked highly upon by the financialforecasting community.\nAt a 2017 dinner I attended in New York, Daniel Kahneman wasasked how investors should respond when our forecasts are wrong.He said:\n \nWhenever we are surprised by something, even if we admit that wemade a mistake, we say, ‘Oh I’ll never make that mistake again.’But, in fact, what you should learn when you make a mistakebecause you did not anticipate something is that the world is difficultto anticipate. That’s the correct lesson to learn from surprises: thatthe world is surprising.\n \nThe correct lesson to learn from surprises is that the world issurprising. Not that we should use past surprises as a guide to futureboundaries; that we should use past surprises as an admission thatwe have no idea what might happen next.\nThe most important economic events of the future—things that willmove the needle the most—are things that history gives us little tono guide about. They will be unprecedented events. Theirunprecedented nature means we won’t be prepared for them, whichis part of what makes them so impactful. This is true for both scaryevents like recessions and wars, and great events like innovation."

    "raw_text": "I’m confident in that prediction because surprises moving the needlethe most is the one forecast that’s been accurate at virtually everypoint in history.\n \n2. History can be a misleading guide to the future of theeconomy and stock market because it doesn’t account forstructural changes that are relevant to today’s world.\n \nConsider a few big ones.\nThe 401(k) is 42 years old. The Roth IRA is younger, created in the1990s. So personal financial advice and analysis about howAmericans save for retirement today is not directly comparable towhat made sense just a generation ago. We have new options.Things changed.\nOr take venture capital. It barely existed 25 years ago. There aresingle venture capital funds today that are larger than the entire\nindustry was a generation ago. ⁴⁰  In his memoir, Nike founder PhilKnight wrote about his early days in business:\n \nThere was no such thing as venture capital. An aspiring youngentrepreneur had very few places to turn, and those places were allguarded by risk-averse gatekeepers with zero imagination. In otherwords, bankers.\n \nWhat this means, in effect, is that all historical data going back just afew decades about how startups are financed is out of date. What weknow about investment cycles and startup failure rates is not a deepbase of history to learn from, because the way companies are fundedtoday is such a new historical paradigm.\nOr take public markets. The S&P 500 did not include financialstocks until 1976; today, financials make up 16% of the index.Technology stocks were virtually nonexistent 50 years ago. Today,they’re more than a fifth of the index. Accounting rules havechanged over time. So have disclosures, auditing, and the amount ofmarket liquidity. Things changed.\nThe time between U.S. recessions has changed dramatically over thelast 150 years:\n\f\nThe average time between recessions has grown from about twoyears in the late 1800s to five years in the early 20th century to eightyears over the last half-century.\nAs I write this it looks like we’re going into recession—12 yearssince the last recession began in December 2007. That’s the longestgap between recessions since before the Civil War.\nThere are plenty of theories on why recessions have become lessfrequent. One is that the Fed is better at managing the businesscycle, or at least extending it. Another is that heavy industry is moreprone to boom-and-bust overproduction than the service industriesthat dominated the last 50 years. The pessimistic view is that wenow have fewer recessions, but when they occur they are morepowerful than before. For our argument it doesn’t particularly matterwhat caused the change. What matters is that things clearly changed.\nTo show how these historic changes should affect investingdecisions, consider the work of a man many believe to be one of thegreatest investment minds of all time: Benjamin Graham.\n\f\nGraham’s classic book, The Intelligent Investor, is more than theory.It gives practical directions like formulas investors can use to makesmart investing decisions.\nI read Graham’s book when I was a teenager, learning aboutinvesting for the first time. The formulas presented in the book wereappealing to me, because they were literally step-by-step instructionson how to get rich. Just follow the instructions. It seemed so easy.\nBut something becomes clear when you try applying some of theseformulas: few of them actually work.\nGraham advocated purchasing stocks trading for less than their networking assets—basically cash in the bank minus all debts. Thissounds great, but few stocks actually trade that cheaply anymore—other than, say, a penny stock accused of accounting fraud.\nOne of Graham’s criteria instructs conservative investors to avoidstocks trading for more than 1.5 times book value. If you followedthis rule over the last decade you would have owned almost nothingbut insurance and bank stocks. There is no world where that is OK.\nThe Intelligent Investor is one of the greatest investing books of alltime. But I don’t know a single investor who has done wellimplementing Graham’s published formulas. The book is full ofwisdom—perhaps more than any other investment book everpublished. But as a how-to guide, it’s questionable at best.\nWhat happened? Was Graham a showman who sounded good butwhose advice didn’t work? Not at all. He was a wildly successfulinvestor himself.\nBut he was practical. And he was a true contrarian. He wasn’t sowedded to investing ideas that he’d stick with them when too manyother investors caught onto those theories, making them so popularas to render their potential useless. Jason Zweig—who annotated alater version of Graham’s book—once wrote:\n \nGraham was constantly experimenting and retesting his assumptionsand seeking out what works—not what worked yesterday but whatworks today. In each revised edition of The Intelligent Investor,Graham discarded the formulas he presented in the previous editionand replaced them with new ones, declaring, in a sense, that “thosedo not work anymore, or they do not work as well as they used to;these are the formulas that seem to work better now.”"

    "raw_text": "One of the common criticisms made of Graham is that all theformulas in the 1972 edition are antiquated. The only properresponse to this criticism is to say: “Of course they are! They are theones he used to replace the formulas in the 1965 edition, whichreplaced the formulas in the 1954 edition, which, in turn, replacedthe ones from the 1949 edition, which were used to augment theoriginal formulas that he presented in Security Analysis in 1934.”\n \nGraham died in 1976. If the formulas he advocated were discardedand updated five times between 1934 and 1972, how relevant do youthink they are in 2020? Or will be in 2050?\nJust before he died Graham was asked whether detailed analysis ofindividual stocks—a tactic he became famous for—remained astrategy he favored. He answered:\n \nIn general, no. I am no longer an advocate of elaborate techniques ofsecurity analysis in order to find superior value opportunities. Thiswas a rewarding activity, say, 40 years ago, when our textbook wasfirst published. But the situation has changed a great deal since\nthen. ⁴ ¹\n \nWhat changed was: Competition grew as opportunities became wellknown; technology made information more accessible; andindustries changed as the economy shifted from industrial totechnology sectors, which have different business cycles and capitaluses.\nThings changed.\nAn interesting quirk of investing history is that the further back youlook, the more likely you are to be examining a world that no longerapplies to today. Many investors and economists take comfort inknowing their forecasts are backed up by decades, even centuries, ofdata. But since economies evolve, recent history is often the bestguide to the future, because it’s more likely to include importantconditions that are relevant to the future.\nThere’s a common phrase in investing, usually used mockingly, that“It’s different this time.” If you need to rebut someone who’spredicting the future won’t perfectly mirror the past, say, “Oh, soyou think it’s different this time?” and drop the mic.

    "raw_text": "investor John Templeton’s view that “The four most dangerouswords in investing are, ‘it’s different this time.’”\nTempleton, though, admitted that it is different at least 20% of thetime. The world changes. Of course it does. And those changes arewhat matter most over time. Michael Batnick put it: “The twelvemost dangerous words in investing are, ‘The four most dangerouswords in investing are, ‘it’s different this time.’”\nThat doesn’t mean we should ignore history when thinking aboutmoney. But there’s an important nuance: The further back in historyyou look, the more general your takeaways should be. Generalthings like people’s relationship to greed and fear, how they behaveunder stress, and how they respond to incentives tend to be stable intime. The history of money is useful for that kind of stuff.\nBut specific trends, specific trades, specific sectors, specific causalrelationships about markets, and what people should do with theirmoney are always an example of evolution in progress. Historiansare not prophets.\nThe question, then, is how should we think about and plan for thefuture? Let’s take a look in the next chapter.\n\f\n\n\f\nSome of the best examples of smart financial behavior can be\nfound in an unlikely place: Las Vegas casinos.\nNot among all players, of course. But a tiny group of blackjack\nplayers who practice card counting can teach ordinary people\nsomething extraordinarily important about managing money:\nthe importance of room for error.\n \n \nThe fundamentals of blackjack card counting are simple:\n \n \nNo one can know with certainty what card the dealer will draw\nnext.\n \nBut by tracking what cards have already been dealt you can\ncalculate what cards remain in the deck.\n \nDoing so can tell you the odds of a particular card being drawn\nby the dealer.\n \nAs a player, you bet more when the odds of getting a card you\nwant are in your favor and less when they are against you.\nThe mechanics of how this is done don’t matter here. What\nmatters is that a blackjack card counter knows they are playing\na game of odds, not certainties. In any particular hand they\nthink they have a good chance of being right, but know there’s\na decent chance they’re wrong. It might sound strange given\ntheir profession, but their strategy relies entirely on humility—\nhumility that they don’t know, and cannot know exactly what’s\ngoing to happen next, so play their hand accordingly. The card\ncounting system works because it tilts the odds ever so slightly\nfrom the house to the player. But bet too heavily even when\nthe odds seem in your favor and, if you’re wrong, you might\n\f\nlose so much that you don’t have enough money to keep\nplaying.\nThere is never a moment when you’re so right that you can bet\nevery chip in front of you. The world isn’t that kind to anyone\n—not consistently, anyways. You have to give yourself room\nfor error. You have to plan on your plan not going according to\nplan.\nKevin Lewis, a successful card counter portrayed in the book\nBringing Down the House, wrote more about this philosophy:\n \nAlthough card counting is statistically proven to work, it does\nnot guarantee you will win every hand—let alone every trip\nyou make to the casino. We must make sure that we have\nenough money to withstand any swings of bad luck.\nLet’s assume you have roughly a 2 percent edge over the\ncasino. That still means the casino will win 49 percent of the\ntime. Therefore, you need to have enough money to withstand\nany variant swings against you. A rule of thumb is that you\nshould have at least a hundred basic units. Assuming you start\nwith ten thousand dollars, you could comfortably play a\nhundred-dollar unit.\n \nHistory is littered with good ideas taken too far, which are\nindistinguishable from bad ideas. The wisdom in having room\nfor error is acknowledging that uncertainty, randomness, and\nchance—“unknowns”—are an ever-present part of life. The\nonly way to deal with them is by increasing the gap between\nwhat you think will happen and what can happen while still\nleaving you capable of fighting another day.\n \n \nBenjamin Graham is known for his concept of margin of\nsafety. He wrote about it extensively and in mathematical\ndetail. But my favorite summary of the theory came when he\nmentioned in an interview that “the purpose of the margin of\nsafety is to render the forecast unnecessary.”"

    "raw_text": "It’s hard to overstate how much power lies in that simple\nstatement.\nMargin of safety—you can also call it room for error or\nredundancy—is the only effective way to safely navigate a\nworld that is governed by odds, not certainties. And almost\neverything related to money exists in that kind of world.\nForecasting with precision is hard. This is obvious to the card\ncounter, because no one could possibly know where a\nparticular card lies in a shuffled deck. It’s less obvious to\nsomeone asking, “What will the average annual return of the\nstock market be over the next 10 years?” or “On what date will\nI be able to retire?” But they are fundamentally the same. The\nbest we can do is think about odds.\nGraham’s margin of safety is a simple suggestion that we don’t\nneed to view the world in front of us as black or white,\npredictable or a crapshoot. The grey area—pursuing things\nwhere a range of potential outcomes are acceptable—is the\nsmart way to proceed.\nBut people underestimate the need for room for error in almost\neverything they do that involves money. Stock analysts give\ntheir clients price targets, not price ranges. Economic\nforecasters predict things with precise figures; rarely broad\nprobabilities. The pundit who speaks in unshakable certainties\nwill gain a larger following than the one who says “We can’t\nknow for sure,” and speaks in probabilities. ⁴ ²\nWe do this in all kinds of financial endeavors, especially those\nrelated to our own decisions. Harvard psychologist Max\nBazerman once showed that when analyzing other people’s\nhome renovation plans, most people estimate the project will\nrun between 25% and 50% over budget. ⁴ ³ But when it comes\nto their own projects, people estimate that renovations will be\ncompleted on time and at budget. Oh, the eventual\ndisappointment.\nTwo things cause us to avoid room for error. One is the idea\nthat somebody must know what the future holds, driven by the\nuncomfortable feeling that comes from admitting the opposite.\nThe second is that you’re therefore doing yourself harm by not\n\f\ntaking actions that fully exploit an accurate view of that future\ncoming true.\nBut room for error is underappreciated and misunderstood. It’s\noften viewed as a conservative hedge, used by those who don’t\nwant to take much risk or aren’t confident in their views. But\nwhen used appropriately, it’s quite the opposite.\nRoom for error lets you endure a range of potential outcomes,\nand endurance lets you stick around long enough to let the\nodds of benefiting from a low-probability outcome fall in your\nfavor. The biggest gains occur infrequently, either because\nthey don’t happen often or because they take time to\ncompound. So the person with enough room for error in part\nof their strategy (cash) to let them endure hardship in another\n(stocks) has an edge over the person who gets wiped out, game\nover, insert more tokens, when they’re wrong.\nBill Gates understood this well. When Microsoft was a young\ncompany, he said he “came up with this incredibly\nconservative approach that I wanted to have enough money in\nthe bank to pay a year’s worth of payroll even if we didn’t get\nany payments coming in.” Warren Buffett expressed a similar\nidea when he told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders in 2008:\n“I have pledged—to you, the rating agencies and myself—to\nalways run Berkshire with more than ample cash … When\nforced to choose, I will not trade even a night’s sleep for the\nchance of extra profits.” ⁴⁴\nThere are a few specific places for investors to think about\nroom for error.\nOne is volatility. Can you survive your assets declining by\n30%? On a spreadsheet, maybe yes—in terms of actually\npaying your bills and staying cash-flow positive. But what\nabout mentally? It is easy to underestimate what a 30% decline\ndoes to your psyche. Your confidence may become shot at the\nvery moment opportunity is at its highest. You—or your\nspouse—may decide it’s time for a new plan, or new career. I\nknow several investors who quit after losses because they were\nexhausted. Physically exhausted. Spreadsheets are good at\ntelling you when the numbers do or don’t add up. They’re not\ngood at modeling how you’ll feel when you tuck your kids in"

    "raw_text": "at night wondering if the investment decisions you’ve made\nwere a mistake that will hurt their future. Having a gap\nbetween what you can technically endure versus what’s\nemotionally possible is an overlooked version of room for\nerror.\nAnother is saving for retirement. We can look at history and\nsee, for example, that the U.S. stock market has returned an\nannual average of 6.8% after inflation since the 1870s. It’s a\nreasonable first approximation to use that as an estimate of\nwhat to expect on your own diversified portfolio when saving\nfor retirement. You can use those return assumptions to back\ninto the amount of money you’ll need to save each month to\nachieve your target nestegg.\nBut what if future returns are lower? Or what if long-term\nhistory is a good estimate of the long-term future, but your\ntarget retirement date ends up falling in the middle of a brutal\nbear market, like 2009? What if a future bear market scares\nyou out of stocks and you end up missing a future bull market,\nso the returns you actually earn are less than the market\naverage? What if you need to cash out your retirement\naccounts in your 30s to pay for a medical mishap?\nThe answer to those what ifs is, “You won’t be able to retire\nlike you once predicted.” Which can be a disaster.\nThe solution is simple: Use room for error when estimating\nyour future returns. This is more art than science. For my own\ninvestments, which I’ll describe more in chapter 20, I assume\nthe future returns I’ll earn in my lifetime will be ⅓ lower than\nthe historic average. So I save more than I would if I assumed\nthe future will resemble the past. It’s my margin of safety. The\nfuture may be worse than ⅓ lower than the past, but no margin\nof safety offers a 100% guarantee. A one-third buffer is\nenough to allow me to sleep well at night. And if the future\ndoes resemble the past, I’ll be pleasantly surprised. “The best\nway to achieve felicity is to aim low,” says Charlie Munger.\nWonderful.\n\f\nAn important cousin of room for error is what I call optimism\nbias in risk-taking, or “Russian roulette should statistically\nwork” syndrome: An attachment to favorable odds when the\ndownside is unacceptable in any circumstances.\nNassim Taleb says, “You can be risk loving and yet completely\naverse to ruin.” And indeed, you should.\nThe idea is that you have to take risk to get ahead, but no risk\nthat can wipe you out is ever worth taking. The odds are in\nyour favor when playing Russian roulette. But the downside is\nnot worth the potential upside. There is no margin of safety\nthat can compensate for the risk.\nSame with money. The odds of many lucrative things are in\nyour favor. Real estate prices go up most years, and during\nmost years you’ll get a paycheck every other week. But if\nsomething has 95% odds of being right, the 5% odds of being\nwrong means you will almost certainly experience the\ndownside at some point in your life. And if the cost of the\ndownside is ruin, the upside the other 95% of the time likely\nisn’t worth the risk, no matter how appealing it looks.\nLeverage is the devil here. Leverage—taking on debt to make\nyour money go further—pushes routine risks into something\ncapable of producing ruin. The danger is that rational\noptimism most of the time masks the odds of ruin some of the\ntime. The result is we systematically underestimate risk.\nHousing prices fell 30% last decade. A few companies\ndefaulted on their debt. That’s capitalism. It happens. But\nthose with high leverage had a double wipeout: Not only were\nthey left broke, but being wiped out erased every opportunity\nto get back in the game at the very moment opportunity was\nripe. A homeowner wiped out in 2009 had no chance of taking\nadvantage of cheap mortgage rates in 2010. Lehman Brothers\nhad no chance of investing in cheap debt in 2009. They were\ndone.\nTo get around this, I think of my own money as barbelled. I\ntake risks with one portion and am terrified with the other.\nThis is not inconsistent, but the psychology of money would\nlead you to believe that it is. I just want to ensure I can remain\nstanding long enough for my risks to pay off. You have to"

To repeat a point we’ve made a few times\nin this book: The ability to do what you want, when you want,\nfor as long as you want, has an infinite ROI.\n \n \nRoom for error does more than just widen the target around\nwhat you think might happen. It also helps protect you from\nthings you’d never imagine, which can be the most\ntroublesome events we face.\nThe Battle of Stalingrad during World War II was the largest\nbattle in history. With it came equally staggering stories of\nhow people dealt with risk.\nOne came in late 1942, when a German tank unit sat in reserve\non grasslands outside the city. When tanks were desperately\nneeded on the front lines, something happened that surprised\neveryone: Almost none of them worked.\nOut of 104 tanks in the unit, fewer than 20 were operable.\nEngineers quickly found the issue. Historian William Craig\nwrites: “During the weeks of inactivity behind the front lines,\nfield mice had nested inside the vehicles and eaten away\ninsulation covering the electrical systems.”\nThe Germans had the most sophisticated equipment in the\nworld. Yet there they were, defeated by mice.\nYou can imagine their disbelief. This almost certainly never\ncrossed their minds. What kind of tank designer thinks about\nmouse protection? Not a reasonable one. And not one who\nstudied tank history.\nBut these kinds of things happen all the time. You can plan for\nevery risk except the things that are too crazy to cross your\nmind. And those crazy things can do the most harm, because\nthey happen more often than you think and you have no plan\nfor how to deal with them.\nIn 2006 Warren Buffett announced a search for his eventual\nreplacement. He said he needed someone “genetically\n\f\nprogrammed to recognize and avoid serious risks, including\nthose never before encountered.” ⁴⁵\nI have seen this skill at work with startups my firm,\nCollaborative Fund, has backed. Ask a founder to list the\nbiggest risks they face, and the usual suspects are mentioned.\nBut beyond the predictable struggles of running a startup, here\nare a few issues we’ve dealt with among our portfolio\ncompanies:\n \n \nWater pipes broke, flooding and ruining a company’s office.\n \nA company’s office was broken into three times.\n \nA company was kicked out of its manufacturing plant.\n \nA store was shut down after a customer called the health\ndepartment because she didn’t like that another customer\nbrought a dog inside.\n \nA CEO’s email was spoofed in the middle of a fundraise that\nrequired all of his attention.\n \nA founder had a mental breakdown.\n \nSeveral of these events were existential to the company’s\nfuture. But none were foreseeable, because none had\npreviously happened to the CEOs dealing with these problems\n—or anyone else they knew, for that matter. It was unchartered\nterritory.\nAvoiding these kinds of unknown risks is, almost by\ndefinition, impossible. You can’t prepare for what you can’t\nenvision."

    "raw_text": "If there’s one way to guard against their damage, it’s avoiding\nsingle points of failure.\nA good rule of thumb for a lot of things in life is that\neverything that can break will eventually break. So if many\nthings rely on one thing working, and that thing breaks, you\nare counting the days to catastrophe. That’s a single point of\nfailure.\nSome people are remarkably good at avoiding single points of\nfailure. Most critical systems on airplanes have backups, and\nthe backups often have backups. Modern jets have four\nredundant electrical systems. You can fly with one engine and\ntechnically land with none, as every jet must be capable of\nstopping on a runway with its brakes alone, without thrust\nreverse from its engines. Suspension bridges can similarly lose\nmany of their cables without falling.\nThe biggest single point of failure with money is a sole\nreliance on a paycheck to fund short-term spending needs,\nwith no savings to create a gap between what you think your\nexpenses are and what they might be in the future.\nThe trick that often goes overlooked—even by the wealthiest\n—is what we saw in chapter 10: realizing that you don’t need\na specific reason to save. It’s fine to save for a car, or a home,\nor for retirement. But it’s equally important to save for things\nyou can’t possibly predict or even comprehend—the financial\nequivalent of field mice.\nPredicting what you’ll use your savings for assumes you live\nin a world where you know exactly what your future expenses\nwill be, which no one does. I save a lot, and I have no idea\nwhat I’ll use the savings for in the future. Few financial plans\nthat only prepare for known risks have enough margin of\nsafety to survive the real world.\nIn fact, the most important part of every plan is planning on\nyour plan not going according to plan.\nNow, let me show you how this applies to you.\n\f\n\n\f\nIgrew up with a friend who came from neither privilege nor\nnatural intellect, but was the hardest-working guy I knew.\nThese people have a lot to teach because they have an\nunfiltered understanding of every inch of the road to success.\nHis life’s mission and dream as a teenager was to be a doctor.\nTo say the odds were stacked against him is being charitable.\nNo reasonable person at the time would consider it a\npossibility.\nBut he pushed. And—a decade older than his classmates—he\neventually became a doctor.\nHow much fulfillment comes from starting from nothing,\nbulldozing your way to the top of medical school, and\nachieving one of the most noble professions against all odds?\nI spoke to him a few years ago. The conversation went like\nthis:\n \nMe: “Long time no talk! How you doi—”\n \nHim: “Awful career.”\n \nMe: “Haha, well—”\n \nHim: “Awful career, man.”\n \nThis went on for 10 minutes. The stress and hours had worn\nhim into the ground. He seemed as disappointed in where he is\ntoday as he was driven toward where he wanted to be 15 years\nago.\nAn underpinning of psychology is that people are poor\nforecasters of their future selves.\nImagining a goal is easy and fun. Imagining a goal in the\ncontext of the realistic life stresses that grow with competitive\npursuits is something entirely different.\n\f\nThis has a big impact on our ability to plan for future financial\ngoals.\n \n \nEvery five-year-old boy wants to drive a tractor when they\ngrow up. Few jobs look better in the eyes of a young boy\nwhose idea of a good job begins and ends with “Vroom\nvroom, beep beep, big tractor, here I come!”\nThen many grow up and realize that driving a tractor maybe\nisn’t the best career. Maybe they want something more\nprestigious or lucrative.\nSo as a teenager they dream of being a lawyer. Now they think\n—they know—their plan is set. Law school and its costs, here\nwe come.\nThen, as a lawyer, they face such long working hours that they\nrarely see their families.\nSo perhaps they take a lower-paying job with flexible hours.\nThen they realize that childcare is so expensive that it\nconsumes most of their paycheck, and they opt to be a stay-at-\nhome parent. This, they conclude, is finally the right choice.\nThen, at age 70, they realize that a lifetime of staying home\nmeans they’re unprepared to afford retirement.\nMany of us wind through life on a similar trajectory. Only\n27% of college grads have a job related to their major,\naccording to the Federal Reserve. ⁴⁶  Twenty-nine percent of\nstay-at-home parents have a college degree. ⁴⁷  Few likely\nregret their education, of course. But we should acknowledge\nthat a new parent in their 30s may think about life goals in a\nway their 18-year-old self making career goals would never\nimagine.\nLong-term financial planning is essential. But things change—\nboth the world around you, and your own goals and desires. It\nis one thing to say, “We don’t know what the future holds.” It’s\nanother to admit that you, yourself, don’t know today what\nyou will even want in the future. And the truth is, few of us do.\n\f\nIt’s hard to make enduring long-term decisions when your\nview of what you’ll want in the future is likely to shift.\nThe End of History Illusion is what psychologists call the\ntendency for people to be keenly aware of how much they’ve\nchanged in the past, but to underestimate how much their\npersonalities, desires, and goals are likely to change in the\nfuture. Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert once said:\n \nAt every stage of our lives we make decisions that will\nprofoundly influence the lives of the people we’re going to\nbecome, and then when we become those people, we’re not\nalways thrilled with the decisions we made. So young people\npay good money to get tattoos removed that teenagers paid\ngood money to get. Middle-aged people rushed to divorce\npeople who young adults rushed to marry. Older adults work\nhard to lose what middle-aged adults worked hard to gain. On\nand on and on. ⁴⁸\n \n“All of us,” he said, “are walking around with an illusion—an\nillusion that history, our personal history, has just come to an\nend, that we have just recently become the people that we\nwere always meant to be and will be for the rest of our lives.”\nWe tend to never learn this lesson. Gilbert’s research shows\npeople from age 18 to 68 underestimate how much they will\nchange in the future.\nYou can see how this can impact a long-term financial plan.\nCharlie Munger says the first rule of compounding is to never\ninterrupt it unnecessarily. But how do you not interrupt a\nmoney plan—careers, investments, spending, budgeting,\nwhatever—when what you want out of life changes? It’s hard.\nPart of the reason people like Ronald Read—the wealthy\njanitor we met earlier in the book—and Warren Buffett\nbecome so successful is because they kept doing the same\nthing for decades on end, letting compounding run wild. But\nmany of us evolve so much over a lifetime that we don’t want\nto keep doing the same thing for decades on end. Or anything\nclose to it. So rather than one 80-something-year lifespan, our\nmoney has perhaps four distinct 20-year blocks.\n\f\nI know young people who purposefully live austere lives with\nlittle income, and they’re perfectly happy with it. Then there\nare those who work their tails off to pay for a life of luxury,\nand they’re perfectly happy with that. Both have risks—the\nformer risks being unprepared to raise a family or fund\nretirement, the latter risks regret that you spent your youthful\nand healthy years in a cubicle.\nThere is no easy solution to this problem. Tell a five-year-old\nboy he should be a lawyer instead of a tractor driver and he\nwill disagree with every cell in his body.\nBut there are two things to keep in mind when making what\nyou think are long-term decisions.\nWe should avoid the extreme ends of financial planning.\nAssuming you’ll be happy with a very low income, or\nchoosing to work endless hours in pursuit of a high one,\nincreases the odds that you’ll one day find yourself at a\npoint of regret. The fuel of the End of History Illusion is\nthat people adapt to most circumstances, so the benefits of\nan extreme plan—the simplicity of having hardly anything,\nor the thrill of having almost everything—wear off. But the\ndownsides of those extremes—not being able to afford\nretirement, or looking back at a life spent devoted to\nchasing dollars—become enduring regrets. Regrets are\nespecially painful when you abandon a previous plan and\nfeel like you have to run in the other direction twice as fast\nto make up for lost time.\nCompounding works best when you can give a plan years or\ndecades to grow. This is true for not only savings but careers\nand relationships. Endurance is key. And when you consider\nour tendency to change who we are over time, balance at every\npoint in your life becomes a strategy to avoid future regret and\nencourage endurance.\nAiming, at every point in your working life, to have moderate\nannual savings, moderate free time, no more than a moderate\ncommute, and at least moderate time with your family,\nincreases the odds of being able to stick with a plan and avoid\nregret than if any one of those things fall to the extreme sides\nof the spectrum.\n\f\nWe should also come to accept the reality of changing our\nminds. Some of the most miserable workers I’ve met are\npeople who stay loyal to a career only because it’s the field\nthey picked when deciding on a college major at age 18.\nWhen you accept the End of History Illusion, you realize\nthat the odds of picking a job when you’re not old enough\nto drink that you will still enjoy when you’re old enough to\nqualify for Social Security are low.\nThe trick is to accept the reality of change and move on as\nsoon as possible.\nJason Zweig, the Wall Street Journal investment columnist,\nworked with psychologist Daniel Kahneman on writing\nKahneman’s book Thinking, Fast and Slow. Zweig once told a\nstory about a personality quirk of Kahneman’s that served him\nwell: “Nothing amazed me more about Danny than his ability\nto detonate what we had just done,” Zweig wrote. He and\nKahneman could work endlessly on a chapter, but:\n \nThe next thing you know, [Kahneman] sends a version so\nutterly transformed that it is unrecognizable: It begins\ndifferently, it ends differently, it incorporates anecdotes and\nevidence you never would have thought of, it draws on\nresearch that you’ve never heard of.\n \n“When I asked Danny how he could start again as if we had\nnever written an earlier draft,” Zweig continued, “he said the\nwords I’ve never forgotten: ‘I have no sunk costs.’” ⁴⁹\nSunk costs—anchoring decisions to past efforts that can’t be\nrefunded—are a devil in a world where people change over\ntime. They make our future selves prisoners to our past,\ndifferent, selves. It’s the equivalent of a stranger making major\nlife decisions for you.\nEmbracing the idea that financial goals made when you were a\ndifferent person should be abandoned without mercy versus\nput on life support and dragged on can be a good strategy to\nminimize future regret.\n\f\nThe quicker it’s done, the sooner you can get back to\ncompounding.\nNext, let’s talk about compounding’s price of admission.\n\f\n\n\f\nEverything has a price, and the key to a lot of things with money isjust figuring out what that price is and being willing to pay it.\nThe problem is that the price of a lot of things is not obvious untilyou’ve experienced them firsthand, when the bill is overdue.\n \n \nGeneral Electric was the largest company in the world in 2004,worth a third of a trillion dollars. It had either been first or secondeach year for the previous decade, capitalism’s shining example ofcorporate aristocracy.\nThen everything fell to pieces.\nThe 2008 financial crisis sent GE’s financing division—whichsupplied more than half the company’s profits—into chaos. It waseventually sold for scrap. Subsequent bets in oil and energy weredisasters, resulting in billions in writeoffs. GE stock fell from $40 in2007 to $7 by 2018.\nBlame placed on CEO Jeff Immelt—who ran the company since2001—was immediate and harsh. He was criticized for hisleadership, his acquisitions, cutting the dividend, laying off workersand—of course—the plunging stock price. Rightly so: thoserewarded with dynastic wealth when times are good hold the burdenof responsibility when the tide goes out. He stepped down in 2017.\nBut Immelt said something insightful on his way out.\nResponding to critics who said his actions were wrong and what heshould have done was obvious, Immelt told his successor, “Everyjob looks easy when you’re not the one doing it.”\nEvery job looks easy when you’re not the one doing it because thechallenges faced by someone in the arena are often invisible to thosein the crowd.\nDealing with the conflicting demands of sprawling bloat, short-terminvestors, regulators, unions, and entrenched bureaucracy is not onlyhard to do, but it’s hard to even recognize the severity of theproblems until you’re the one dealing with them. Immelt’s successor,who lasted 14 months, learned this as well.\nMost things are harder in practice than they are in theory. Sometimesthis is because we’re overconfident. More often it’s because we’re\n\f\nnot good at identifying what the price of success is, which preventsus from being able to pay it.\n \n \nThe S&P 500 increased 119-fold in the 50 years ending 2018. Allyou had to do was sit back and let your money compound. But, ofcourse, successful investing looks easy when you’re not the onedoing it.\n“Hold stocks for the long run,” you’ll hear. It’s good advice.\nBut do you know how hard it is to maintain a long-term outlookwhen stocks are collapsing?\nLike everything else worthwhile, successful investing demands aprice. But its currency is not dollars and cents. It’s volatility, fear,doubt, uncertainty, and regret—all of which are easy to overlookuntil you’re dealing with them in real time.\nThe inability to recognize that investing has a price can tempt us totry to get something for nothing. Which, like shoplifting, rarely endswell.\nSay you want a new car. It costs $30,000. You have three options: 1)Pay $30,000 for it, 2) find a cheaper used one, or 3) steal it. In thiscase, 99% of people know to avoid the third option, because theconsequences of stealing a car outweigh the upside.\nBut say you want to earn an 11% annual return over the next 30years so you can retire in peace. Does this reward come free? Ofcourse not. The world is never that nice. There’s a price tag, a billthat must be paid. In this case it’s a never-ending taunt from themarket, which gives big returns and takes them away just as fast.Including dividends the Dow Jones Industrial Average returnedabout 11% per year from 1950 to 2019, which is great. But the priceof success during this period was dreadfully high. The shaded linesin the chart show when it was at least 5% below its previous all-timehigh.\n\f\nThis is the price of market returns. The fee. It is the cost ofadmission. And it hurts.\nLike most products, the bigger the returns, the higher the price.Netflix stock returned more than 35,000% from 2002 to 2018, buttraded below its previous all-time high on 94% of days. MonsterBeverage returned 319,000% from 1995 to 2018—among thehighest returns in history—but traded below its previous high 95%of the time during that period.\nNow here’s the important part. Like the car, you have a few options:You can pay this price, accepting volatility and upheaval. Or you canfind an asset with less uncertainty and a lower payoff, the equivalentof a used car. Or you can attempt the equivalent of grand-theft auto:Try to get the return while avoiding the volatility that comes alongwith it.\nMany people in investing choose the third option. Like a car thief—though well-meaning and law-abiding—they form tricks andstrategies to get the return without paying the price. They trade in\n\f\nand out. They attempt to sell before the next recession and buybefore the next boom. Most investors with even a little experienceknow that volatility is real and common. Many then take what seemslike the next logical step: trying to avoid it.\nBut the Money Gods do not look highly upon those who seek areward without paying the price. Some car thieves will get awaywith it. Many more will be caught and punished.\nSame thing with investing.\nMorningstar once looked at the performance of tactical mutualfunds, whose strategy is to switch between stocks and bonds atopportune times, capturing market returns with lower downside\nrisk. ⁵⁰  They want the returns without paying the price. The studyfocused on the mid-2010 through late 2011 period, when U.S. stockmarkets went wild on fears of a new recession and the S&P 500declined more than 20%. This is the exact kind of environment thetactical funds are supposed to work in. It was their moment to shine.\nThere were, by Morningstar’s count, 112 tactical mutual fundsduring this period. Only nine had better risk-adjusted returns than asimple 60/40 stock-bond fund. Less than a quarter of the tacticalfunds had smaller maximum drawdowns than the leave-it-aloneindex. Morningstar wrote: “With a few exceptions, [tactical funds]gained less, were more volatile, or were subject to just as muchdownside risk” as the hands-off fund.\nIndividual investors fall for this when making their owninvestments, too. The average equity fund investor underperformedthe funds they invested in by half a percent per year, according toMorningstar—the result of buying and selling when they should\nhave just bought and held. ⁵ ¹\nThe irony is that by trying to avoid the price, investors end uppaying double.\nBack to GE. One of its many faults stems from an era under formerCEO Jack Welch. Welch became famous for ensuring quarterlyearnings per share beat Wall Street estimates. He was thegrandmaster. If Wall Street analysts expected $0.25 per share, Jackwould deliver $0.26 no matter the state of business or the economy.He’d do that by massaging the numbers—that description ischaritable—often pulling gains from future quarters into the currentquarter to make the obedient numbers salute their master.\nForbes reported one of dozens of examples: “[General Electric] fortwo years in a row ‘sold’ locomotives to unnamed financial partners\n\f\ninstead of end users in transactions that left most of the risks of\nownership with GE.” ⁵ ²\nWelch never denied this game. He wrote in his book Straight Fromthe Gut:\n \nThe response of our business leaders to the crises was typical of theGE culture. Even though the books had closed on the quarter, manyimmediately offered to pitch in to cover the [earnings] gap. Somesaid they could find an extra $10 million, $20 million, and even $30million from their business to offset the surprise.\n \nThe result was that under Welch’s leadership, stockholders didn’thave to pay the price. They got consistency and predictability—astock that surged year after year without the surprises of uncertainty.Then the bill came due, like it always does. GE shareholders havesuffered through a decade of mammoth losses that were previouslyshielded by accounting maneuvers. The penny gains of Welch’s erabecame dime losses today.\nThe strangest example of this comes from failed mortgage giantsFreddie Mac and Fannie Mae, which in the early 2000s were caughtunder-reporting current earnings by billions of dollars with theintention of spreading those gains out over future periods to give\ninvestors the illusion of smoothness and predictability. ⁵ ³ The illusionof not having to pay the price.\n \n \nThe question is: Why do so many people who are willing to pay theprice of cars, houses, food, and vacations try so hard to avoid payingthe price of good investment returns?\nThe answer is simple: The price of investing success is notimmediately obvious. It’s not a price tag you can see, so when thebill comes due it doesn’t feel like a fee for getting something good.It feels like a fine for doing something wrong. And while people aregenerally fine with paying fees, fines are supposed to be avoided.You’re supposed to make decisions that preempt and avoid fines.Traffic fines and IRS fines mean you did something wrong anddeserve to be punished. The natural response for anyone whowatches their wealth decline and views that drop as a fine is to avoidfuture fines.\n\f\nIt sounds trivial, but thinking of market volatility as a fee rather thana fine is an important part of developing the kind of mindset that letsyou stick around long enough for investing gains to work in yourfavor.\nFew investors have the disposition to say, “I’m actually fine if I lose20% of my money.” This is doubly true for new investors who havenever experienced a 20% decline.\nBut if you view volatility as a fee, things look different.\nDisneyland tickets cost $100. But you get an awesome day withyour kids you’ll never forget. Last year more than 18 million peoplethought that fee was worth paying. Few felt the $100 was apunishment or a fine. The worthwhile tradeoff of fees is obviouswhen it’s clear you’re paying one.\nSame with investing, where volatility is almost always a fee, not afine.\nMarket returns are never free and never will be. They demand youpay a price, like any other product. You’re not forced to pay this fee,just like you’re not forced to go to Disneyland. You can go to thelocal county fair where tickets might be $10, or stay home for free.You might still have a good time. But you’ll usually get what youpay for. Same with markets. The volatility/uncertainty fee—the priceof returns—is the cost of admission to get returns greater than low-fee parks like cash and bonds.\nThe trick is convincing yourself that the market’s fee is worth it.That’s the only way to properly deal with volatility and uncertainty—not just putting up with it, but realizing that it’s an admission feeworth paying.\nThere’s no guarantee that it will be. Sometimes it rains atDisneyland.\nBut if you view the admission fee as a fine, you’ll never enjoy themagic.\nFind the price, then pay it.\n\f\n\n\f\nThe implosion of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s\nreduced household wealth by $6.2 trillion.\nThe end of the housing bubble cut away more than $8 trillion.\nIt’s hard to overstate how socially devastating financial\nbubbles can be. They ruin lives.\nWhy do these things happen?\nAnd why do they keep happening?\nWhy can’t we learn our lessons?\nThe common answer here is that people are greedy, and greed\nis an indelible feature of human nature.\nThat may be true, and it’s a good enough answer for most. But\nremember from chapter 1: no one is crazy. People make\nfinancial decisions they regret, and they often do so with\nscarce information and without logic. But the decisions made\nsense to them when they were made. Blaming bubbles on\ngreed and stopping there misses important lessons about how\nand why people rationalize what in hindsight look like greedy\ndecisions.\nPart of why bubbles are hard to learn from is that they are not\nlike cancer, where a biopsy gives us a clear warning and\ndiagnosis. They are closer to the rise and fall of a political\nparty, where the outcome is known in hindsight but the cause\nand blame are never agreed upon.\nCompetition for investment returns is fierce, and someone has\nto own every asset at every point in time. That means the mere\nidea of bubbles will always be controversial, because no one\nwants to think they own an overvalued asset. In hindsight\nwe’re more likely to point cynical fingers than to learn lessons.\nI don’t think we’ll ever be able to fully explain why bubbles\noccur. It’s like asking why wars occur—there are almost\nalways several reasons, many of them conflicting, all of them\ncontroversial.\nIt’s too complicated a subject for simple answers.\n\f\nBut let me propose one reason they happen that both goes\noverlooked and applies to you personally: Investors often\ninnocently take cues from other investors who are playing a\ndifferent game than they are.\n \n \nAn idea exists in finance that seems innocent but has done\nincalculable damage.\nIt’s the notion that assets have one rational price in a world\nwhere investors have different goals and time horizons.\nAsk yourself: How much should you pay for Google stock\ntoday?\nThe answer depends on who “you” are.\nDo you have a 30-year time horizon? Then the smart price to\npay involves a sober analysis of Google’s discounted cash\nflows over the next 30 years.\nAre you looking to cash out within 10 years? Then the price to\npay can be figured out by an analysis of the tech industry’s\npotential over the next decade and whether Google\nmanagement can execute on its vision.\nAre you looking to sell within a year? Then pay attention to\nGoogle’s current product sales cycles and whether we’ll have a\nbear market.\nAre you a day trader? Then the smart price to pay is “who\ncares?” because you’re just trying to squeeze a few bucks out\nof whatever happens between now and lunchtime, which can\nbe accomplished at any price.\nWhen investors have different goals and time horizons—and\nthey do in every asset class—prices that look ridiculous to one\nperson can make sense to another, because the factors those\ninvestors pay attention to are different.\nTake the dot-com bubble in the 1990s.\nPeople can look at Yahoo! stock in 1999 and say “That was\ncrazy! A zillion times revenue! The valuation made no sense!”\n\f\nBut many investors who owned Yahoo! stock in 1999 had time\nhorizons so short that it made sense for them to pay a\nridiculous price. A day trader could accomplish what they\nneed whether Yahoo! was at $5 a share or $500 a share as long\nas it moved in the right direction that day. And it did, for\nyears.\nAn iron rule of finance is that money chases returns to the\ngreatest extent that it can. If an asset has momentum—it’s\nbeen moving consistently up for a period of time—it’s not\ncrazy for a group of short-term traders to assume it will keep\nmoving up. Not indefinitely; just for the short period of time\nthey need it to. Momentum attracts short-term traders in a\nreasonable way.\nThen it’s off to the races.\nBubbles form when the momentum of short-term returns\nattracts enough money that the makeup of investors shifts from\nmostly long term to mostly short term.\nThat process feeds on itself. As traders push up short-term\nreturns, they attract even more traders. Before long—and it\noften doesn’t take long—the dominant market price-setters\nwith the most authority are those with shorter time horizons.\nBubbles aren’t so much about valuations rising. That’s just a\nsymptom of something else: time horizons shrinking as more\nshort-term traders enter the playing field.\nIt’s common to say the dot-com bubble was a time of irrational\noptimism about the future. But one of the most common\nheadlines of that era was announcing record trading volume,\nwhich is what happens when investors are buying and selling\nin a single day. Investors—particularly the ones setting prices\n—were not thinking about the next 20 years. The average\nmutual fund had 120% annual turnover in 1999, meaning they\nwere, at most, thinking about the next eight months. So were\nthe individual investors who bought those mutual funds.\nMaggie Mahar wrote in her book Bull!:\n \nBy the mid-nineties, the press had replaced annual scorecards\nwith reports that appeared every three months. The change\n\f\nspurred investors to chase performance, rushing to buy the\nfunds at the top of the charts, just when they were most\nexpensive.\n \nThis was the era of day trading, short-term option contracts,\nand up-to-the minute market commentary. It’s not the kind of\nthing you’d associate with long-term views.\nThe same thing happened during the housing bubble of the\nmid-2000s.\nIt’s hard to justify paying $700,000 for a two-bedroom Florida\ntrack home to raise your family in for the next 10 years. But it\nmakes perfect sense if you plan on flipping the home in a few\nmonths into a market with rising prices to make a quick profit.\nWhich is exactly what many people were doing during the\nbubble.\nData from Attom, a company that tracks real estate\ntransactions, shows the number of houses in America that sold\nmore than once in a 12-month period—they were flipped—\nrose fivefold during the bubble, from 20,000 in the first\nquarter of 2000 to over 100,000 in the first quarter of 2004. ⁵⁴\nFlipping plunged after the bubble to less than 40,000 per\nquarter, where it’s roughly remained since.\nDo you think these flippers cared about long-term price-to-rent\nratios? Or whether the prices they paid were backed up by\nlong-term income growth? Of course not. Those numbers\nweren’t relevant to their game. The only thing that mattered to\nflippers was that the price of the home would be more next\nmonth than it was this month. And for many years, it was.\nYou can say a lot about these investors. You can call them\nspeculators. You can call them irresponsible. You can shake\nyour head at their willingness to take huge risks.\nBut I don’t think you can call all of them irrational.\nThe formation of bubbles isn’t so much about people\nirrationally participating in long-term investing. They’re about\npeople somewhat rationally moving toward short-term trading\nto capture momentum that had been feeding on itself.\n\f\nWhat do you expect people to do when momentum creates a\nbig short-term return potential? Sit and watch patiently?\nNever. That’s not how the world works. Profits will always be\nchased. And short-term traders operate in an area where the\nrules governing long-term investing—particularly around\nvaluation—are ignored, because they’re irrelevant to the game\nbeing played.\nThat’s where things get interesting, and where the problems\nbegin.\nBubbles do their damage when long-term investors playing\none game start taking their cues from those short-term traders\nplaying another.\nCisco stock rose 300% in 1999 to $60 per share. At that price\nthe company was valued at $600 billion, which is insane. Few\nactually thought it was worth that much; the day-traders were\njust having their fun. Economist Burton Malkiel once pointed\nout that Cisco’s implied growth rate at that valuation meant it\nwould become larger than the entire U.S. economy within 20\nyears.\nBut if you were a long-term investor in 1999, $60 was the only\nprice available to buy. And many people were buying it at that\nprice. So you may have looked around and said to yourself,\n“Wow, maybe these other investors know something I don’t.”\nMaybe you went along with it. You even felt smart about it.\nWhat you don’t realize is that the traders who were setting the\nmarginal price of the stock were playing a different game than\nyou were. Sixty dollars a share was a reasonable price for the\ntraders, because they planned on selling the stock before the\nend of the day, when its price would probably be higher. But\nsixty dollars was a disaster in the making for you, because you\nplanned on holding shares for the long run.\nThese two investors rarely even know that each other exist.\nBut they’re on the same field, running toward each other.\nWhen their paths blindly collide, someone gets hurt. Many\nfinance and investment decisions are rooted in watching what\nother people do and either copying them or betting against\nthem. But when you don’t know why someone behaves like\n\f\nthey do you won’t know how long they’ll continue acting that\nway, what will make them change their mind, or whether\nthey’ll ever learn their lesson.\nWhen a commentator on CNBC says, “You should buy this\nstock,” keep in mind that they do not know who you are. Are\nyou a teenager trading for fun? An elderly widow on a limited\nbudget? A hedge fund manager trying to shore up your books\nbefore the quarter ends? Are we supposed to think those three\npeople have the same priorities, and that whatever level a\nparticular stock is trading at is right for all three of them?\nIt’s crazy.\nIt’s hard to grasp that other investors have different goals than\nwe do, because an anchor of psychology is not realizing that\nrational people can see the world through a different lens than\nyour own. Rising prices persuade all investors in ways the best\nmarketers envy. They are a drug that can turn value-conscious\ninvestors into dewy-eyed optimists, detached from their own\nreality by the actions of someone playing a different game than\nthey are.\nBeing swayed by people playing a different game can also\nthrow off how you think you’re supposed to spend your\nmoney. So much consumer spending, particularly in developed\ncountries, is socially driven: subtly influenced by people you\nadmire, and done because you subtly want people to admire\nyou.\nBut while we can see how much money other people spend on\ncars, homes, clothes, and vacations, we don’t get to see their\ngoals, worries, and aspirations. A young lawyer aiming to be a\npartner at a prestigious law firm might need to maintain an\nappearance that I, a writer who can work in sweatpants, have\nno need for. But when his purchases set my own expectations,\nI’m wandering down a path of potential disappointment\nbecause I’m spending the money without the career boost he’s\ngetting. We might not even have different styles. We’re just\nplaying a different game. It took me years to figure this out.\nA takeaway here is that few things matter more with money\nthan understanding your own time horizon and not being"

    "raw_text": "persuaded by the actions and behaviors of people playing\ndifferent games than you are.\nThe main thing I can recommend is going out of your way to\nidentify what game you’re playing.\nIt’s surprising how few of us do. We call everyone investing\nmoney “investors” like they’re basketball players, all playing\nthe same game with the same rules. When you realize how\nwrong that notion is you see how vital it is to simply identify\nwhat game you’re playing. How I invest my own money is\ndetailed in chapter 20, but years ago I wrote out “I am a\npassive investor optimistic in the world’s ability to generate\nreal economic growth and I’m confident that over the next 30\nyears that growth will accrue to my investments.”\nThis might seem quaint, but once you write that mission\nstatement down you realize everything that’s unrelated to it—\nwhat the market did this year, or whether we’ll have a\nrecession next year—is part of a game I’m not playing. So I\ndon’t pay attention to it, and am in no danger of being\npersuaded by it.\nNext, let’s talk about pessimism.\n\f\n\n\f\n“For reasons I have never understood, people like to hear that\nthe world is going to hell.”\n \n—Historian Deirdre McCloskey\n \nOptimism is the best bet for most people because the world\ntends to get better for most people most of the time.\nBut pessimism holds a special place in our hearts. Pessimism\nisn’t just more common than optimism. It also sounds smarter.\nIt’s intellectually captivating, and it’s paid more attention than\noptimism, which is often viewed as being oblivious to risk.\nBefore we go further we should define what optimism is. Real\noptimists don’t believe that everything will be great. That’s\ncomplacency. Optimism is a belief that the odds of a good\noutcome are in your favor over time, even when there will be\nsetbacks along the way. The simple idea that most people\nwake up in the morning trying to make things a little better\nand more productive than wake up looking to cause trouble is\nthe foundation of optimism. It’s not complicated. It’s not\nguaranteed, either. It’s just the most reasonable bet for most\npeople, most of the time. The late statistician Hans Rosling put\nit differently: “I am not an optimist. I am a very serious\npossibilist.”\nNow we can discuss optimism’s more compelling sibling:\npessimism.\n \n \nDecember 29th, 2008.\nThe worst year for the economy in modern history is about to\nclose. Stock markets around the world had collapsed. The\nglobal financial system was on day-to-day life support.\nUnemployment was surging.\nAs things looked like they couldn’t get worse, The Wall Street\nJournal published a story arguing that we hadn’t seen anything"

    "raw_text": "yet. It ran a front-page article on the outlook of a Russian\nprofessor named Igor Panarin whose economic views rival the\nflair of science fiction writers.\nThe Journal wrote:\n \nAround the end of June 2010, or early July, [Panarin] says, the\nU.S. will break into six pieces—with Alaska reverting to\nRussian control … California will form the nucleus of what he\ncalls “The Californian Republic,” and will be part of China or\nunder Chinese influence. Texas will be the heart of “The Texas\nRepublic,” a cluster of states that will go to Mexico or fall\nunder Mexican influence. Washington, D.C., and New York\nwill be part of an “Atlantic America” that may join the\nEuropean Union. Canada will grab a group of Northern states\nProf. Panarin calls “The Central North American Republic.”\nHawaii, he suggests, will be a protectorate of Japan or China,\nand Alaska will be subsumed into Russia. ⁵⁵\n \nThis was not the ramblings of a backroom blog or tinfoil-hat\nnewsletter. This was on the front page of the most prestigious\nfinancial newspaper in the world.\nIt is fine to be pessimistic about the economy. It’s even OK to\nbe apocalyptic. History is full of examples of countries\nexperiencing not just recessions, but disintegrations.\nThe interesting thing about Panarin-type stories is that their\npolar opposite—forecasts of outrageous optimism—are rarely\ntaken as seriously as prophets of doom.\nTake Japan in the late 1940s. The nation was gutted by defeat\nfrom World War II in every way—economically, industrially,\nculturally, socially. A brutal winter in 1946 caused a famine\nthat limited food to less than 800 calories per person per day. ⁵⁶\nImagine if a Japanese academic had written a newspaper\narticle during this time that said:\n\f\nChin up, everyone. Within our lifetime our economy will grow\nto almost 15 times the size it was before the end of the war.\nOur life expectancy will nearly double. Our stock market will\nproduce returns like any country in history has rarely seen. We\nwill go more than 40 years without ever seeing unemployment\ntop 6%. We will become a world leader in electronic\ninnovation and corporate managerial systems. Before long we\nwill be so rich that we will own some of the most prized real\nestate in the United States. Americans, by the way, will be our\nclosest ally and will try to copy our economic insights.\n \nThey would have been summarily laughed out of the room and\nasked to seek a medical evaluation.\nKeep in mind the description above is what actually happened\nin Japan in the generation after the war. But the mirror\nopposite of Panarin looks absurd in a way a forecast of doom\ndoesn’t.\nPessimism just sounds smarter and more plausible than\noptimism.\nTell someone that everything will be great and they’re likely to\neither shrug you off or offer a skeptical eye. Tell someone\nthey’re in danger and you have their undivided attention.\nIf a smart person tells me they have a stock pick that’s going to\nrise 10-fold in the next year, I will immediately write them off\nas full of nonsense.\nIf someone who’s full of nonsense tells me that a stock I own\nis about to collapse because it’s an accounting fraud, I will\nclear my calendar and listen to their every word.\nSay we’ll have a big recession and newspapers will call you.\nSay we’re headed for average growth and no one particularly\ncares. Say we’re nearing the next Great Depression and you’ll\nget on TV. But mention that good times are ahead, or markets\nhave room to run, or that a company has huge potential, and a\ncommon reaction from commentators and spectators alike is\nthat you are either a salesman or comically aloof of risks.\n\f\nThe investing newsletter industry has known this for years,\nand is now populated by prophets of doom despite operating in\nan environment where the stock market has gone up 17,000-\nfold in the last century (including dividends).\nThis is true beyond finance. Matt Ridley wrote in his book The\nRational Optimist:\n \nA constant drumbeat of pessimism usually drowns out any\ntriumphalist song … If you say the world has been getting\nbetter you may get away with being called naïve and\ninsensitive. If you say the world is going to go on getting\nbetter, you are considered embarrassingly mad. If, on the other\nhand, you say catastrophe is imminent, you may expect a\nMcArthur genius award or even the Nobel Peace Prize. In my\nown adult lifetime … the fashionable reasons for pessimism\nchanged, but the pessimism was constant.\n \n“Every group of people I ask thinks the world is more\nfrightening, more violent, and more hopeless—in short, more\ndramatic—than it really is,” Hans Rosling wrote in his book\nFactfulness.\nWhen you realize how much progress humans can make\nduring a lifetime in everything from economic growth to\nmedical breakthroughs to stock market gains to social equality,\nyou would think optimism would gain more attention than\npessimism. And yet.\nThe intellectual allure of pessimism has been known for ages.\nJohn Stuart Mill wrote in the 1840s: “I have observed that not\nthe man who hopes when others despair, but the man who\ndespairs when others hope, is admired by a large class of\npersons as a sage.”\nThe question is, why? And how does it impact how we think\nabout money?\n\f\nLet’s repeat the premise that no one is crazy.\nThere are valid reasons why pessimism is seductive when\ndealing with money. It just helps to know what they are to\nensure we don’t take them too far.\nPart of it is instinctual and unavoidable. Kahneman says the\nasymmetric aversion to loss is an evolutionary shield. He\nwrites:\n \nWhen directly compared or weighted against each other, losses\nloom larger than gains. This asymmetry between the power of\npositive and negative expectations or experiences has an\nevolutionary history. Organisms that treat threats as more\nurgent than opportunities have a better chance to survive and\nreproduce.\n \nBut a few other things make financial pessimism easy,\ncommon, and more persuasive than optimism.\n \nOne is that money is ubiquitous, so something bad\nhappening tends to affect everyone and captures\neveryone’s attention.\n \nThat isn’t true of, say, weather. A hurricane barreling down on\nFlorida poses no direct risk to 92% of Americans. But a\nrecession barreling down on the economy could impact every\nsingle person—including you, so pay attention.\nThis goes for something as specific as the stock market. More\nthan half of all American households directly own stocks. ⁵⁷\nEven among those that don’t, the stock market’s gyrations are\npromoted so heavily in the media that the Dow Jones\nIndustrial Average might be the stock-less household’s most-\nwatched economic barometer.\nStocks rising 1% might be briefly mentioned in the evening\nnews. But a 1% fall will be reported in bold, all-caps letters\nusually written in blood red. The asymmetry is hard to avoid.\n\f\nAnd while few question or try to explain why the market went\nup—isn’t it supposed to go up?—there is almost always an\nattempt to explain why it went down.\nAre investors worried about economic growth?\nDid the Fed screw things up again?\nAre politicians making bad decisions?\nIs there another shoe to drop?\nNarratives about why a decline occurred make them easier to\ntalk about, worry about, and frame a story around what you\nthink will happen next—usually, more of the same.\nEven if you don’t own stocks, those kind of things will grab\nyour attention. Only 2.5% of Americans owned stocks on the\neve of the great crash of 1929 that sparked the Great\nDepression. But the majority of Americans—if not the world\n—watched in amazement as the market collapsed, wondering\nwhat it signaled about their own fate. This was true whether\nyou were a lawyer or a farmer or a car mechanic.\nHistorian Eric Rauchway writes:\n \nThis fall in value immediately afflicted only a few Americans.\nBut so closely had the others watched the market and regarded\nit as an index of their fates that they suddenly stopped much of\ntheir economic activity. As the economist Joseph Schumpeter\nlater wrote, “people felt that the ground under their feet was\ngiving way.” ⁵⁸\n \nThere are two topics that will affect your life whether you are\ninterested in them or not: money and health. While health\nissues tend to be individual, money issues are more systemic.\nIn a connected system where one person’s decisions can affect\neveryone else, it’s understandable why financial risks gain a\nspotlight and capture attention in a way few other topics can.\n \nAnother is that pessimists often extrapolate present trends\nwithout accounting for how markets adapt."

    "raw_text": "In 2008 environmentalist Lester Brown wrote: “By 2030\nChina would need 98 million barrels of oil a day. The world is\ncurrently producing 85 million barrels a day and may never\nproduce much more than that. There go the world’s oil\nreserves.” ⁵⁹\nHe’s right. The world would run out of oil in that scenario.\nBut that’s not how markets work.\nThere is an iron law in economics: extremely good and\nextremely bad circumstances rarely stay that way for long\nbecause supply and demand adapt in hard-to-predict ways.\nConsider what happened to oil immediately after Brown’s\nprediction.\nOil prices surged in 2008 as growing global demand—much of\nit from China—crept up to potential output. A barrel of oil\nsold for $20 in 2001 and $138 by 2008. ⁶⁰\nThe new price meant drilling oil was like pulling gold out of\nthe ground. The incentives for oil producers changed\ndramatically. Hard-to-tap oil supplies that weren’t worth the\nfight at $20 a barrel—the cost of drilling didn’t offset the price\nyou could sell it for—became the bonanza of a lifetime now\nthat you could sell a barrel for $138.\nThat sparked a surge of new fracking and horizontal drilling\ntechnologies.\nThe Earth has had roughly the same amount of oil reserves for\nall of human history. And we’ve known where the big oil\ndeposits are for some time. What changes is the technology we\nhave that lets us economically pull the stuff out of the ground.\nOil historian Daniel Yergin writes: “86% of oil reserves in the\nUnited States are the result not of what is estimated at time of\ndiscovery but of the revisions” that come when our technology\nimproves.\nThat’s what happened as fracking took off in 2008. In the\nUnited States alone oil production went from roughly five\nmillion barrels per day in 2008 to 13 million by 2019. ⁶ ¹ World\n\f\noil production is now over 100 million barrels per day—some\n20% above what Brown assumed was the high mark.\nTo a pessimist extrapolating oil trends in 2008, of course\nthings looked bad. To a realist who understood that necessity\nis the mother of all invention, it was far less scary.\nAssuming that something ugly will stay ugly is an easy\nforecast to make. And it’s persuasive, because it doesn’t\nrequire imagining the world changing. But problems correct\nand people adapt. Threats incentivize solutions in equal\nmagnitude. That’s a common plot of economic history that is\ntoo easily forgotten by pessimists who forecast in straight\nlines.\n \nA third is that progress happens too slowly to notice, but\nsetbacks happen too quickly to ignore.\n \nThere are lots of overnight tragedies. There are rarely\novernight miracles.\nOn January 5th, 1889, the Detroit Free Press pushed back\nagainst the long-held dream that man could one day fly like a\nbird. Airplanes, the paper wrote, “appear impossible”:\n \nThe smallest possible weight of a flying machine, with the\nnecessary fuel and engineer, could not be less than 300 or 400\npounds … but there is a low limit of weight, certainly not\nmuch beyond fifty pounds, beyond which it is impossible for\nan animal to fly. Nature has reached this limit, and with her\nutmost effort has failed to pass it.\n \nSix months later, Orville Wright dropped out of high school to\nhelp his brother, Wilbur, tinker in their backyard shed to build\na printing press. It was the brothers’ first joint invention. It\nwould not be their last.\nIf you had to make a list of the most important inventions of\nthe 20th century, the airplane would be at least top five, if not\n\f\nnumber one. The airplane changed everything. It started world\nwars, it ended world wars. It connected the world, bridging\ngaps between cities and rural communities; oceans and\ncountries.\nBut the story of the Wright Brothers’ quest to build the first\nplane has a fascinating twist.\nAfter they conquered flight, no one seemed to notice. Nobody\nseemed to care.\nIn his 1952 book on American history, Frederick Lewis Allen\nwrote:\n \nSeveral years went by before the public grasped what the\nWrights were doing; people were so convinced that flying was\nimpossible that most of those who saw them flying about\nDayton [Ohio] in 1905 decided that what they had seen must\nbe some trick without significance—somewhat as most people\ntoday would regard a demonstration of, say, telepathy. It was\nnot until May, 1908—nearly four and a half years after the\nWright’s first flight—that experienced reporters were sent to\nobserve what they were doing, experienced editors gave full\ncredence to these reporters’ excited dispatches, and the world\nat last woke up to the fact that human flight had been\nsuccessfully accomplished.\n \nEven after people caught on to the plane’s wonder, they\nunderestimated it for years.\nFirst it was seen mainly as a military weapon. Then a rich\nperson’s toy. Then, perhaps, used to transport a few people.\nThe Washington Post wrote in 1909: “There will never be such\na thing as commercial aerial freighters. Freight will continue\nto drag its slow weight across the patient earth.” The first\ncargo plane took off five months later.\nNow compare that slow, years-long awakening to becoming\noptimistic about the airplane to how quickly people pay\nattention to drivers of pessimism, like a corporate bankruptcy.\n\f\nOr a major war.\nOr a plane crash. Some of the first mentions of the Wright’s\nplane came in 1908 when an Army Lieutenant named Thomas\nSelfridge was killed during a demonstration flight. ⁶ ²\nGrowth is driven by compounding, which always takes time.\nDestruction is driven by single points of failure, which can\nhappen in seconds, and loss of confidence, which can happen\nin an instant.\nIt’s easier to create a narrative around pessimism because the\nstory pieces tend to be fresher and more recent. Optimistic\nnarratives require looking at a long stretch of history and\ndevelopments, which people tend to forget and take more\neffort to piece together.\nConsider the progress of medicine. Looking at the last year\nwill do you little good. Any single decade won’t do much\nbetter. But looking at the last 50 years will show something\nextraordinary. For example, the age-adjusted death rate per\ncapita from heart disease has declined more than 70% since\n1965, according to the National Institute of Health. ⁶ ³ A 70%\ndecline in heart-disease death is enough to save something like\nhalf a million American lives per year. Picture the population\nof Atlanta saved every year. But since that progress happened\nso slowly, it captures less attention than quick, sudden losses\nlike terrorism, plane crashes, or natural disasters. We could\nhave a Hurricane Katrina five times a week, every week—\nimagine how much attention that would receive—and it would\nnot offset the number of annual lives saved by the decline in\nheart disease in the last 50 years.\nThis same thing applies to business, where it takes years to\nrealize how important a product or company is, but failures\ncan happen overnight.\nAnd in stock markets, where a 40% decline that takes place in\nsix months will draw congressional investigations, but a 140%\ngain that takes place over six years can go virtually unnoticed.\nAnd in careers, where reputations take a lifetime to build and a\nsingle email to destroy."

    "raw_text": "The short sting of pessimism prevails while the powerful pull\nof optimism goes unnoticed.\nThis underscores an important point made previously in this\nbook: In investing you must identify the price of success—\nvolatility and loss amid the long backdrop of growth—and be\nwilling to pay it.\n \n \nIn 2004 The New York Times interviewed Stephen Hawking,\nthe scientist whose incurable motor-neuron disease left him\nparalyzed and unable to talk at age 21.\nThrough his computer, Hawking told the interviewer how\nexcited he was to sell books to lay people.\n“Are you always this cheerful?” the Times asked.\n“My expectations were reduced to zero when I was 21.\nEverything since then has been a bonus,” he replied.\nExpecting things to be great means a best-case scenario that\nfeels flat. Pessimism reduces expectations, narrowing the gap\nbetween possible outcomes and outcomes you feel great about.\nMaybe that’s why it’s so seductive. Expecting things to be bad\nis the best way to be pleasantly surprised when they’re not.\nWhich, ironically, is something to be optimistic about.\nNow, a short story about stories."

His job is to keep tabs on\nour economy.\nHe circles above New York City, trying to size up the\neconomy and how it changed between 2007 and 2009.\nOn New Year’s Eve 2007 he hovers over Times Square. He\nsees tens of thousands of happy partygoers surrounded by\nbright lights, monstrous billboards, fireworks, and TV\ncameras.\nHe comes back to Times Square on New Year’s Eve 2009. He\nsees tens of thousands of happy partygoers surrounded by\nbright lights, monstrous billboards, fireworks, and TV\ncameras.\nIt looks about the same. He cannot see much difference.\nHe sees roughly the same number of New Yorkers hustling\naround the city. Those people are surrounded by the same\nnumber of office buildings, which house the same number of\ndesks with the same number of computers, hooked up to the\nsame number of internet connections.\nOutside the city he sees the same number of factories and\nwarehouses, connected by the same highways, carrying the\nsame number of trucks.\nHe gets a little closer to the ground and sees the same\nuniversities teaching the same topics and handing out the same\ndegrees to the same number of people.\nHe sees the same number of patents protecting the same\ngroundbreaking ideas.\nHe notices that technology has improved. Everyone in 2009\ncarries smartphones that didn’t exist in 2007. Computers are\nnow faster. Medicine is better. Cars get better gas mileage.\nSolar and fracking technology has advanced. Social media has\ngrown exponentially.\nAs he flies around the country he sees the same. Around the\nglobe, more of the same.\nThe economy is in about the same shape, maybe even better,\nin 2009 as it was in 2007, he concludes.\n\f\nThen he looks at the numbers.\nHe’s shocked that U.S. households are $16 trillion poorer in\n2009 than they were in 2007.\nHe’s dumbfounded that 10 million more Americans are\nunemployed.\nHe’s in disbelief when he learns the stock market is worth half\nof what it was two years before.\nHe can’t believe that people’s forecast of their economic\npotential has plunged.\n“I don’t get it,” he says. “I’ve seen the cities. I’ve looked at the\nfactories. You guys have the same knowledge, the same tools,\nthe same ideas. Nothing has changed! Why are you poorer?\nWhy are you more pessimistic?”\nThere was one change the alien couldn’t see between 2007 and\n2009: The stories we told ourselves about the economy.\nIn 2007, we told a story about the stability of housing prices,\nthe prudence of bankers, and the ability of financial markets to\naccurately price risk.\nIn 2009 we stopped believing that story.\nThat’s the only thing that changed. But it made all the\ndifference in the world.\nOnce the narrative that home prices will keep rising broke,\nmortgage defaults rose, then banks lost money, then they\nreduced lending to other businesses, which led to layoffs,\nwhich led to less spending, which led to more layoffs, and on\nand on.\nOther than clinging to a new narrative, we had an identical—if\nnot greater—capacity for wealth and growth in 2009 as we did\nin 2007. Yet the economy suffered its worst hit in 80 years.\nThis is different from, say, Germany in 1945, whose\nmanufacturing base had been obliterated. Or Japan in the\n2000s, whose working-age population was shrinking. That’s\ntangible economic damage. In 2009 we inflicted narrative\ndamage on ourselves, and it was vicious. It’s one of the most\npotent economic forces that exists.\n\f\nWhen we think about the growth of economies, businesses,\ninvestments and careers, we tend to think about tangible things\n—how much stuff do we have and what are we capable of?\nBut stories are, by far, the most powerful force in the\neconomy. They are the fuel that can let the tangible parts of the\neconomy work, or the brake that holds our capabilities back.\nAt the personal level, there are two things to keep in mind\nabout a story-driven world when managing your money.\n \n \n1. The more you want something to be true, the more likely\nyou are to believe a story that overestimates the odds of it\nbeing true.\n \nWhat was the happiest day of your life?\nThe documentary How to Live Forever asks that innocent\nquestion to a centenarian who offered an amazing response.\n“Armistice Day,” she said, referring to the 1918 agreement\nthat ended World War I.\n“Why?” the producer asks.\n“Because we knew there would be no more wars ever again,”\nshe says.\nWorld War II began 21 years later, killing 75 million people.\nThere are many things in life that we think are true because we\ndesperately want them to be true.\nI call these things “appealing fictions.” They have a big impact\non how we think about money—particularly investments and\nthe economy.\nAn appealing fiction happens when you are smart, you want to\nfind solutions, but face a combination of limited control and\nhigh stakes.\nThey are extremely powerful. They can make you believe just\nabout anything."

Elders in his Yemeni village\nproposed a folk remedy: shove the tip of a burning stick\nthrough his son’s chest to drain the sickness from his body.\nAfter the procedure, Hajaji told The New York Times: “When\nyou have no money, and your son is sick, you’ll believe\nanything.” ⁶⁴\nMedicine predates useful medicine by thousands of years.\nBefore the scientific method and the discovery of germs there\nwas blood-letting, starvation therapy, cutting holes in your\nbody to let the evils out, and other treatments that did nothing\nbut hasten your demise.\nIt seems crazy. But if you desperately need a solution and a\ngood one isn’t known or readily available to you, the path of\nleast resistance is toward Hajaji’s reasoning: willing to believe\nanything. Not just try anything, but believe it.\nChronicling the Great Plague of London, Daniel Defoe wrote\nin 1722:\n \nThe people were more addicted to prophecies and astrological\nconjurations, dreams, and old wives’ tales than ever they were\nbefore or since … almanacs frighted them terribly … the posts\nof houses and corners of streets were plastered over with\ndoctors’ bills and papers of ignorant fellows, quacking and\ninviting the people to come to them for remedies, which was\ngenerally set off with such flourishes as these: ‘Infallible\npreventive pills against the plague.’ ‘Neverfailing\npreservatives against the infection.’ ‘Sovereign cordials\nagainst the corruption of the air.’\n \nThe plague killed a quarter of Londoners in 18 months. You’ll\nbelieve just about anything when the stakes are that high.\nNow think about how the same set of limited information and\nhigh stakes impact our financial decisions.\n\f\nWhy do people listen to TV investment commentary that has\nlittle track record of success? Partly because the stakes are so\nhigh in investing. Get a few stock picks right and you can\nbecome rich without much effort. If there’s a 1% chance that\nsomeone’s prediction will come true, and it coming true will\nchange your life, it’s not crazy to pay attention—just in case.\nAnd there are so many financial opinions that once you pick a\nstrategy or side, you become invested in them both financially\nand mentally. If you want a certain stock to rise 10-fold, that’s\nyour tribe. If you think a certain economic policy will spark\nhyperinflation, that’s your side.\nThese may be low-probability bets. The problem is that\nviewers can’t, or don’t, calibrate low odds, like a 1% chance.\nMany default to a firm belief that what they want to be true is\nunequivocally true. But they’re only doing that because the\npossibility of a huge outcome exists.\nInvesting is one of the only fields that offers daily\nopportunities for extreme rewards. People believe in financial\nquackery in a way they never would for, say, weather quackery\nbecause the rewards for correctly predicting what the stock\nmarket will do next week are in a different universe than the\nrewards for predicting whether it will be sunny or rainy next\nweek.\nConsider that 85% of active mutual funds underperformed\ntheir benchmark over the 10 years ending 2018. ⁶⁵  That figure\nhas been fairly stable for generations. You would think an\nindustry with such poor performance would be a niche service\nand have a hard time staying in business. But there’s almost\nfive trillion dollars invested in these funds. ⁶⁶  Give someone\nthe chance of investing alongside “the next Warren Buffett”\nand they’ll believe with such faith that millions of people will\nput their life savings behind it.\nOr take Bernie Madoff. In hindsight his Ponzi scheme should\nhave been obvious. He reported returns that never varied, they\nwere audited by a relatively unknown accounting firm, and he\nrefused to release much information on how the returns were\nachieved.

    "raw_text": "the most sophisticated investors in the world. He told a good\nstory, and people wanted to believe it.\nThis is a big part of why room for error, flexibility, and\nfinancial independence—important themes discussed in\nprevious chapters—are indispensable.\nThe bigger the gap between what you want to be true and what\nyou need to be true to have an acceptable outcome, the more\nyou are protecting yourself from falling victim to an appealing\nfinancial fiction.\nWhen thinking about room for error in a forecast it is tempting\nto think that potential outcomes range from you being just\nright enough to you being very, very right. But the biggest risk\nis that you want something to be true so badly that the range of\nyour forecast isn’t even in the same ballpark as reality.\nIn its last 2007 meeting the Federal Reserve predicted what\neconomic growth would be in 2008 and 2009. ⁶⁷  Already\nweary of a weakening economy, it was not optimistic. It\npredicted a range of potential growth—1.6% growth on the\nlow end, 2.8% on the high end. That was its margin of safety,\nits room for error. In reality the economy contracted by more\nthan 2%, meaning the Fed’s low-end estimate was off by\nalmost threefold.\nIt’s hard for a policymaker to predict an outright recession,\nbecause a recession will make their careers complicated. So\neven worst-case projections rarely expect anything worse than\njust “slow-ish” growth. It’s an appealing fiction, and it’s easy\nto believe because expecting anything worse is too painful to\nconsider.\nPolicymakers are easy targets for criticism, but all of us do this\nto some extent. And we do it in both directions. If you think a\nrecession is coming and you cash out your stocks in\nanticipation, your view of the economy is suddenly going to be\nwarped by what you want to happen. Every blip, every\nanecdote, will look like a sign that doom has arrived—maybe\nnot because it has, but because you want it to.\nIncentives are a powerful motivator, and we should always\nremember how they influence our own financial goals and\n\f\noutlooks. It can’t be overstated: there is no greater force in\nfinance than room for error, and the higher the stakes, the\nwider it should be.\n \n2. Everyone has an incomplete view of the world. But we\nform a complete narrative to fill in the gaps.\n \nMy daughter is about a year old as I write this. She’s curious\nabout everything and learns so fast.\nBut sometimes I think about all the stuff she can’t\ncomprehend.\nShe has no idea why her dad goes to work every morning.\nThe concept of bills, budgets, careers, promotions, and saving\nfor retirement are completely foreign to her.\nImagine trying to explain the Federal Reserve, credit\nderivatives, or NAFTA to her. Impossible.\nBut her world isn’t dark. She does not wander around in\nconfusion.\nEven at a year old, she’s written her own internal narrative of\nhow everything works. Blankets keep you warm, mom\nsnuggles keep you safe, and dates taste good.\nEverything she comes across fits into one of a few dozen\nmental models she’s learned. When I go to work she doesn’t\nstop in confusion, wondering what salary and bills are. She has\na crystal clear explanation of the situation: Dad isn’t playing\nwith me, and I wanted him to play with me, so I’m sad.\nEven though she knows little, she doesn’t realize it, because\nshe tells herself a coherent story about what’s going on based\non the little she does know.\nAll of us, no matter our age, do the same thing.\nJust like my daughter, I don’t know what I don’t know. So I\nam just as susceptible to explaining the world through the\nlimited set of mental models I have at my disposal.\n\f\nLike her, I look for the most understandable causes in\neverything I come across. And, like her, I’m wrong about a lot\nof them, because I know a lot less about how the world works\nthan I think I do.\nThis is true for the most fact-based of subjects.\nTake history. It’s just the recounting of stuff that already\nhappened. It should be clear and objective. But as B. H.\nLiddell Hart writes in the book Why Don’t We Learn From\nHistory?:\n \n[History] cannot be interpreted without the aid of imagination\nand intuition. The sheer quantity of evidence is so\noverwhelming that selection is inevitable. Where there is\nselection there is art. Those who read history tend to look for\nwhat proves them right and confirms their personal opinions.\nThey defend loyalties. They read with a purpose to affirm or to\nattack. They resist inconvenient truth since everyone wants to\nbe on the side of the angels. Just as we start wars to end all\nwars.\n \nDaniel Kahneman once told me about the stories people tell\nthemselves to make sense of the past. He said:\n \nHindsight, the ability to explain the past, gives us the illusion\nthat the world is understandable. It gives us the illusion that\nthe world makes sense, even when it doesn’t make sense.\nThat’s a big deal in producing mistakes in many fields.\n \nMost people, when confronted with something they don’t\nunderstand, do not realize they don’t understand it because\nthey’re able to come up with an explanation that makes sense\nbased on their own unique perspective and experiences in the\nworld, however limited those experiences are. We all want the\ncomplicated world we live in to make sense. So we tell\nourselves stories to fill in the gaps of what are effectively blind\nspots.\n\f\nWhat these stories do to us financially can be both fascinating\nand terrifying.\nWhen I’m blind to parts of how the world works I might\ncompletely misunderstand why the stock market is behaving\nlike it is, in a way that gives me too much confidence in my\nability to know what it might do next. Part of the reason\nforecasting the stock market and the economy is so hard is\nbecause you are the only person in the world who thinks the\nworld operates the way you do. When you make decisions for\nreasons that I can’t even comprehend, I might follow you\nblindly into a decision that’s right for you and disastrous to\nme. This, as we saw in chapter 16, is how bubbles form.\nComing to terms with how much you don’t know means\ncoming to terms with how much of what happens in the world\nis out of your control. And that can be hard to accept.\nThink about market forecasts. We’re very, very bad at them. I\nonce calculated that if you just assume that the market goes up\nevery year by its historic average, your accuracy is better than\nif you follow the average annual forecasts of the top 20 market\nstrategists from large Wall Street banks. Our ability to predict\nrecessions isn’t much better. And since big events come out of\nnowhere, forecasts may do more harm than good, giving the\nillusion of predictability in a world where unforeseen events\ncontrol most outcomes. Carl Richards writes: “Risk is what’s\nleft over when you think you’ve thought of everything.”\nPeople know this. I have not met an investor who genuinely\nthinks market forecasts as a whole are accurate or useful. But\nthere’s still tremendous demand for forecasts, in both the\nmedia and from financial advisors.\nWhy?\nPsychologist Philip Tetlock once wrote: “We need to believe\nwe live in a predictable, controllable world, so we turn to\nauthoritative-sounding people who promise to satisfy that\nneed.”\nSatisfying that need is a great way to put it. Wanting to believe\nwe are in control is an emotional itch that needs to be\nscratched, rather than an analytical problem to be calculated\n\f\nand solved. The illusion of control is more persuasive than the\nreality of uncertainty. So we cling to stories about outcomes\nbeing in our control.\nPart of this has to do with confusing fields of precision with\nfields of uncertainty.\nNASA’s New Horizons spacecraft passed by Pluto two years\nago. It was a three-billion mile trip that took nine and a half\nyears. According to NASA, the trip “took about one minute\nless than predicted when the craft was launched in January\n2006.” ⁶⁸\nThink about that. In an untested, decade-long journey, NASA’s\nforecast was 99.99998% accurate. That’s like forecasting a trip\nfrom New York to Boston and being accurate to within four\nmillionths of a second.\nBut astrophysics is a field of precession. It isn’t impacted by\nthe vagaries of human behavior and emotions, like finance is.\nBusiness, economics, and investing, are fields of uncertainty,\noverwhelmingly driven by decisions that can’t easily be\nexplained with clean formulas, like a trip to Pluto can. But we\ndesperately want it to be like a trip to Pluto, because the idea\nof a NASA engineer being in 99.99998% control of an\noutcome is beautiful and comforting. It’s so comforting that\nwe’re tempted to tell ourselves stories about how much control\nwe have in other parts of our life, like money.\nKahneman once laid out the path these stories take:\n \n \nWhen planning we focus on what we want to do and can do,\nneglecting the plans and skills of others whose decisions might\naffect our outcomes.\n \nBoth in explaining the past and in predicting the future, we\nfocus on the causal role of skill and neglect the role of luck.\n\f\nWe focus on what we know and neglect what we do not know,\nwhich makes us overly confident in our beliefs.\n \nHe described how this impacts businesses:\n \nI have had several occasions to ask founders and participants\nin innovative start-ups a question: To what extent will the\noutcome of your effort depend on what you do in your firm?\nThis is evidently an easy question; the answer comes quickly\nand it has never been less than 80%. Even when they are not\nsure they will succeed, these bold people think their fate is\nalmost entirely in their own hands. They are surely wrong: the\noutcome of a start-up depends as much on the achievements of\nits competitors and on changes in the market as on its own\nefforts. However, entrepreneurs naturally focus on what they\nknow best—their plans and actions and the most immediate\nthreats and opportunities, such as the availability of funding.\nThey know less about their competitors and therefore find it\nnatural to imagine a future in which the competition plays\nlittle part.\n \nWe all do this to some extent.\nAnd like my daughter, it doesn’t bother us a bit.\nWe don’t wander around blind and confused. We have to think\nthe world we operate in makes sense based on what we happen\nto know. It’d be too hard to get out of bed in the morning if\nyou felt otherwise.\nBut the alien circling over Earth?\nThe one who’s confident he knows what’s happening based on\nwhat he sees but turns out to be completely wrong because he\ncan’t know the stories going on inside everyone else’s head?\nHe’s all of us."

    "raw_text": "Congratulations, you’re still reading.\nIt’s time to tie together a few things we’ve learned.\nThis chapter is a bit of a summary; a few short and actionable\nlessons that can help you make better financial decisions.\nFirst, let me tell you a story about a dentist appointment gone\nhorribly awry. It teaches us something vital about the dangers\nof giving advice about what to do with your money.\n \n \nClarence Hughes went to the dentist in 1931. His mouth was\nradiating pain. His dentist put him under crude anesthesia to\nease the pain. When Clarence awoke hours later he had 16\nfewer teeth and his tonsils removed.\nAnd then everything went wrong. Clarence died a week later\nfrom his surgery’s complications.\nHis wife sued the dentist, but not because the surgery went\nawry. Every surgery risked death in 1931.\nClarence, she said, never consented to the procedures in the\nfirst place, and wouldn’t if he were asked.\nThe case wove through courts, but went nowhere. Consent\nbetween doctor and patient wasn’t black and white in 1931.\nOne court summed up the idea that doctors require freedom to\nmake the best medical decisions: “Without such, we could not\nenjoy the advancement of science.”\nFor most of history the ethos of medicine was that the doctor’s\njob was to fix the patient, and what the patient thought about\nthe doctor’s treatment plans wasn’t relevant. Dr. Jay Katz\nwrote about the philosophy in his book The Silent World\nBetween Doctor and Patient:\n \nDoctors felt that in order to accomplish that objective they\nwere obligated to attend to their patients’ physical and\nemotional needs and to do so on their own authority, without\nconsulting with their patients about the decisions that needed\n\f\nto be made. The idea that patients may also be entitled to\nsharing the burdens of decisions with their doctors was never\npart of the ethos of medicine.\n \nThis wasn’t ego or malice. It was a belief in two points:\n \n \nEvery patient wants to be cured.\n \nThere is a universal and right way to cure them.\n \nNot requiring patient consent in treatment plans makes sense if\nyou believe in those two points.\nBut that’s not how medicine works.\nIn the last 50 years medical schools subtly shifted teaching\naway from treating disease and toward treating patients. That\nmeant laying out the options of treatment plans, and then\nletting the patient decide the best path forward.\nThis trend was partly driven by patient-protection laws, partly\nby Katz’s influential book, which argued that patients have\nwildly different views about what’s worth it in medicine, so\ntheir beliefs have to be taken into consideration. Katz wrote:\n \nIt is dangerous nonsense to assert that in the practice of their\nart and science physicians can rely on their benevolent\nintentions, their abilities to judge what is the right thing to do\n… It is not that easy. Medicine is a complex profession and the\ninteractions between physicians and patients are also complex.\n \nThat last line is important. “Medicine is a complex profession\nand the interactions between physicians and patients are also\ncomplex.”\nYou know what profession is the same? Financial advice.\n\f\nI can’t tell you what to do with your money, because I don’t\nknow you.\nI don’t know what you want. I don’t know when you want it. I\ndon’t know why you want it.\nSo I’m not going to tell you what to do with your money. I\ndon’t want to treat you like a dentist treated Clarence Hughes.\nBut doctors and dentists aren’t useless, obviously. They have\nknowledge. They know the odds. They know what tends to\nwork, even if patients come to different conclusions about\nwhat kind of treatment is right for them.\nFinancial advisors are the same. There are universal truths in\nmoney, even if people come to different conclusions about\nhow they want to apply those truths to their own finances.\nWith that caveat in place, let’s look at a few short\nrecommendations that can help you make better decisions with\nyour money.\n \n \nGo out of your way to find humility when things are going\nright and forgiveness/compassion when they go wrong.\nBecause it’s never as good or as bad as it looks. The world\nis big and complex. Luck and risk are both real and hard\nto identify. Do so when judging both yourself and others.\nRespect the power of luck and risk and you’ll have a better\nchance of focusing on things you can actually control.\nYou’ll also have a better chance of finding the right role\nmodels.\nLess ego, more wealth. Saving money is the gap between\nyour ego and your income, and wealth is what you don’t\nsee. So wealth is created by suppressing what you could\nbuy today in order to have more stuff or more options in\nthe future. No matter how much you earn, you will never\nbuild wealth unless you can put a lid on how much fun you\ncan have with your money right now, today.\n\f\nManage your money in a way that helps you sleep at night.\nThat’s different from saying you should aim to earn the\nhighest returns or save a specific percentage of your\nincome. Some people won’t sleep well unless they’re\nearning the highest returns; others will only get a good rest\nif they’re conservatively invested. To each their own. But\nthe foundation of, “does this help me sleep at night?” is the\nbest universal guidepost for all financial decisions.\nIf you want to do better as an investor, the single most\npowerful thing you can do is increase your time horizon.\nTime is the most powerful force in investing. It makes little\nthings grow big and big mistakes fade away. It can’t\nneutralize luck and risk, but it pushes results closer\ntowards what people deserve.\nBecome OK with a lot of things going wrong. You can be\nwrong half the time and still make a fortune, because a\nsmall minority of things account for the majority of\noutcomes. No matter what you’re doing with your money\nyou should be comfortable with a lot of stuff not working.\nThat’s just how the world is. So you should always\nmeasure how you’ve done by looking at your full portfolio,\nrather than individual investments. It is fine to have a\nlarge chunk of poor investments and a few outstanding\nones. That’s usually the best-case scenario. Judging how\nyou’ve done by focusing on individual investments makes\nwinners look more brilliant than they were, and losers\nappear more regrettable than they should.\nUse money to gain control over your time, because not\nhaving control of your time is such a powerful and\nuniversal drag on happiness. The ability to do what you\nwant, when you want, with who you want, for as long as\nyou want to, pays the highest dividend that exists in\nfinance.\nBe nicer and less flashy. No one is impressed with your\npossessions as much as you are. You might think you want\na fancy car or a nice watch. But what you probably want is\nrespect and admiration. And you’re more likely to gain\n\f\nthose things through kindness and humility than\nhorsepower and chrome.\nSave. Just save. You don’t need a specific reason to save.\nIt’s great to save for a car, or a downpayment, or a medical\nemergency. But saving for things that are impossible to\npredict or define is one of the best reasons to save.\nEveryone’s life is a continuous chain of surprises. Savings\nthat aren’t earmarked for anything in particular is a hedge\nagainst life’s inevitable ability to surprise the hell out of\nyou at the worst possible moment.\nDefine the cost of success and be ready to pay it. Because\nnothing worthwhile is free. And remember that most\nfinancial costs don’t have visible price tags. Uncertainty,\ndoubt, and regret are common costs in the finance world.\nThey’re often worth paying. But you have to view them as\nfees (a price worth paying to get something nice in\nexchange) rather than fines (a penalty you should avoid).\nWorship room for error. A gap between what could\nhappen in the future and what you need to happen in the\nfuture in order to do well is what gives you endurance, and\nendurance is what makes compounding magic over time.\nRoom for error often looks like a conservative hedge, but if\nit keeps you in the game it can pay for itself many times\nover.\nAvoid the extreme ends of financial decisions. Everyone’s\ngoals and desires will change over time, and the more\nextreme your past decisions were the more you may regret\nthem as you evolve.\nYou should like risk because it pays off over time. But you\nshould be paranoid of ruinous risk because it prevents you\nfrom taking future risks that will pay off over time.\nDefine the game you’re playing, and make sure your\nactions are not being influenced by people playing a\ndifferent game.\nRespect the mess. Smart, informed, and reasonable people\ncan disagree in finance, because people have vastly\n\f\ndifferent goals and desires. There is no single right answer;\njust the answer that works for you.\nNow let me tell you what works for me."

    "raw_text": "Sandy Gottesman, a billionaire investor who founded the\nconsulting group First Manhattan, is said to ask one question\nwhen interviewing candidates for his investment team: “What\ndo you own, and why?”\nNot, “What stocks do you think are cheap?” or “What\neconomy is about to have a recession?”\nJust show me what you do with your own money.\nI love this question because it highlights what can often be a\nmile-wide gap between what makes sense—which is what\npeople suggest you do—and what feels right to them—which\nis what they actually do.\n \n \nHalf of all U.S. mutual fund portfolio managers do not invest a\ncent of their own money in their funds, according to\nMorningstar. ⁶⁹  This might seem atrocious, and surely the\nstatistic uncovers some hypocrisy.\nBut this kind of stuff is more common than you’d think. Ken\nMurray, a professor of medicine at USC, wrote an essay in\n2011 titled “How Doctors Die” that showed the degree to\nwhich doctors choose different end-of-life treatments for\nthemselves than they recommend for their patients. ⁷⁰\n“[Doctors] don’t die like the rest of us,” he wrote. “What’s\nunusual about them is not how much treatment they get\ncompared to most Americans, but how little. For all the time\nthey spend fending off the deaths of others, they tend to be\nfairly serene when faced with death themselves. They know\nexactly what is going to happen, they know the choices, and\nthey generally have access to any sort of medical care they\ncould want. But they go gently.” A doctor may throw the\nkitchen sink at her patient’s cancer, but choose palliative care\nfor herself.\nThe difference between what someone suggests you do and\nwhat they do for themselves isn’t always a bad thing. It just\nunderscores that when dealing with complicated and emotional\n\f\nissues that affect you and your family, there is no one right\nanswer. There is no universal truth. There’s only what works\nfor you and your family, checking the boxes you want checked\nin a way that leaves you comfortable and sleeping well at\nnight.\nThere are basic principles that must be adhered to—this is true\nin finance and in medicine—but important financial decisions\nare not made in spreadsheets or in textbooks. They are made at\nthe dinner table. They often aren’t made with the intention of\nmaximizing returns, but minimizing the chance of\ndisappointing a spouse or child. Those kinds of things are\ndifficult to summarize in charts or formulas, and they vary\nwidely from person to person. What works for one person may\nnot work for another.\nYou have to find what works for you. Here’s what works for\nme.\n \nHow my family thinks about savings\n \nCharlie Munger once said “I did not intend to get rich. I just\nwanted to get independent.”\nWe can leave aside rich, but independence has always been my\npersonal financial goal. Chasing the highest returns or\nleveraging my assets to live the most luxurious life has little\ninterest to me. Both look like games people do to impress their\nfriends, and both have hidden risks. I mostly just want to wake\nup every day knowing my family and I can do whatever we\nwant to do on our own terms. Every financial decision we\nmake revolves around that goal.\nMy parents lived their adult years in two stages: dirt poor and\nmoderately well off. My father became a doctor when he was\n40 and already had three kids. Earning a doctor’s salary did\nnot offset the frugal mentality that is forced when supporting\nthree hungry kids while in medical school, and my parents\nspent the good years living well below their means with a high\nsavings rate. This gave them a degree of independence. My\nfather was an Emergency Room doctor, one of the highest-\n\f\nstress professions I can imagine and one that requires a painful\ntoggling of circadian rhythms between night and day shifts.\nAfter two decades he decided he’d had enough, so he stopped.\nJust quit. Moved onto the next phase of his life.\nThat stuck with me. Being able to wake up one morning and\nchange what you’re doing, on your own terms, whenever\nyou’re ready, seems like the grandmother of all financial goals.\nIndependence, to me, doesn’t mean you’ll stop working. It\nmeans you only do the work you like with people you like at\nthe times you want for as long as you want.\nAnd achieving some level of independence does not rely on\nearning a doctor’s income. It’s mostly a matter of keeping your\nexpectations in check and living below your means.\nIndependence, at any income level, is driven by your savings\nrate. And past a certain level of income your savings rate is\ndriven by your ability to keep your lifestyle expectations from\nrunning away.\nMy wife and I met in college and moved in with each other\nyears before we got married. After school we both had entry-\nlevel jobs with entry-level pay, and settled into a moderate\nlifestyle. All lifestyles exist on a spectrum, and what is decent\nto one person can feel like royalty or poverty to another. But at\nour incomes we got what we considered a decent apartment, a\ndecent car, decent clothes, decent food. Comfortable, but\nnothing close to fancy.\nDespite more than a decade of rising incomes—myself in\nfinance, my wife in health care—we’ve more or less stayed at\nthat lifestyle ever since. That’s pushed our savings rate\ncontinuously higher. Virtually every dollar of raise has accrued\nto savings—our “independence fund.” We now live\nconsiderably below our means, which tells you little about our\nincome and more about our decision to maintain a lifestyle\nthat we established in our 20s.\nIf there’s a part of our household financial plan I’m proud of\nit’s that we got the goalpost of lifestyle desires to stop moving\nat a young age. Our savings rate is fairly high, but we rarely\nfeel like we’re repressively frugal because our aspirations for\nmore stuff haven’t moved much. It’s not that our aspirations\n\f\nare nonexistent—we like nice stuff and live comfortably. We\njust got the goalpost to stop moving.\nThis would not work for everyone, and it only works for us\nbecause we both agree to it equally—neither of us are\ncompromising for the other. Most of what we get pleasure\nfrom—going for walks, reading, podcasts—costs little, so we\nrarely feel like we’re missing out. On the rare occasion when I\nquestion our savings rate I think of the independence my\nparents earned from years of high savings, and I quickly come\nback. Independence is our top goal. A secondary benefit of\nmaintaining a lifestyle below what you can afford is avoiding\nthe psychological treadmill of keeping up with the Joneses.\nComfortably living below what you can afford, without much\ndesire for more, removes a tremendous amount of social\npressure that many people in the modern first world subject\nthemselves to. Nassim Taleb explained: “True success is\nexiting some rat race to modulate one’s activities for peace of\nmind.” I like that.\nWe’re so far committed to the independence camp that we’ve\ndone things that make little sense on paper. We own our house\nwithout a mortgage, which is the worst financial decision\nwe’ve ever made but the best money decision we’ve ever\nmade. Mortgage interest rates were absurdly low when we\nbought our house. Any rational advisor would recommend\ntaking advantage of cheap money and investing extra savings\nin higher-return assets, like stocks. But our goal isn’t to be\ncoldly rational; just psychologically reasonable.\nThe independent feeling I get from owning our house outright\nfar exceeds the known financial gain I’d get from leveraging\nour assets with a cheap mortgage. Eliminating the monthly\npayment feels better than maximizing the long-term value of\nour assets. It makes me feel independent.\nI don’t try to defend this decision to those pointing out its\nflaws, or those who would never do the same. On paper it’s\ndefenseless. But it works for us. We like it. That’s what\nmatters. Good decisions aren’t always rational. At some point\nyou have to choose between being happy or being “right.”\n\f\nWe also keep a higher percentage of our assets in cash than\nmost financial advisors would recommend—something around\n20% of our assets outside the value of our house. This is also\nclose to indefensible on paper, and I’m not recommending it to\nothers. It’s just what works for us.\nWe do it because cash is the oxygen of independence, and—\nmore importantly—we never want to be forced to sell the\nstocks we own. We want the probability of facing a huge\nexpense and needing to liquidate stocks to cover it to be as\nclose to zero as possible. Perhaps we just have a lower risk\ntolerance than others.\nBut everything I’ve learned about personal finance tells me\nthat everyone—without exception—will eventually face a\nhuge expense they did not expect—and they don’t plan for\nthese expenses specifically because they did not expect them.\nThe few people who know the details of our finances ask,\n“What are you saving for? A house? A boat? A new car?” No,\nnone of those. I’m saving for a world where curveballs are\nmore common than we expect. Not being forced to sell stocks\nto cover an expense also means we’re increasing the odds of\nletting the stocks we own compound for the longest period of\ntime. Charlie Munger put it well: “The first rule of\ncompounding is to never interrupt it unnecessarily.”\n \nHow my family thinks about investing\n \nI started my career as a stock picker. At the time we only\nowned individual stocks, mostly large companies like\nBerkshire Hathaway and Procter & Gamble, mixed with\nsmaller stocks I considered deep value investments. Go back\nto my 20s and at any given point I held something like 25\nindividual stocks.\nI don’t know how I did as a stock picker. Did I beat the\nmarket? I’m not sure. Like most who try, I didn’t keep a good\nscore. Either way, I’ve shifted my views and now every stock\nwe own is a low-cost index fund.\n\f\nI don’t have anything against actively picking stocks, either on\nyour own or through giving your money to an active fund\nmanager. I think some people can outperform the market\naverages—it’s just very hard, and harder than most people\nthink.\nIf I had to summarize my views on investing, it’s this: Every\ninvestor should pick a strategy that has the highest odds of\nsuccessfully meeting their goals. And I think for most\ninvestors, dollar-cost averaging into a low-cost index fund will\nprovide the highest odds of long-term success.\nThat doesn’t mean index investing will always work. It doesn’t\nmean it’s for everyone. And it doesn’t mean active stock\npicking is doomed to fail. In general, this industry has become\ntoo entrenched on one side or the other—particularly those\nvehemently against active investing.\nBeating the market should be hard; the odds of success should\nbe low. If they weren’t, everyone would do it, and if everyone\ndid it there would be no opportunity. So no one should be\nsurprised that the majority of those trying to beat the market\nfail to do so. (The statistics show 85% of large-cap active\nmanagers didn’t beat the S&P 500 over the decade ending\n2019.) ⁷ ¹\nI know people who think it’s insane to try to beat the market\nbut encourage their kids to reach for the stars and try to\nbecome professional athletes. To each their own. Life is about\nplaying the odds, and we all think about odds a little\ndifferently.\nOver the years I came around to the view that we’ll have a\nhigh chance of meeting all of our family’s financial goals if we\nconsistently invest money into a low-cost index fund for\ndecades on end, leaving the money alone to compound. A lot\nof this view comes from our lifestyle of frugal spending. If\nyou can meet all your goals without having to take the added\nrisk that comes from trying to outperform the market, then\nwhat’s the point of even trying? I can afford to not be the\ngreatest investor in the world, but I can’t afford to be a bad\none. When I think of it that way, the choice to buy the index\nand hold on is a no-brainer for us. I know not everyone will\n\f\nagree with that logic, especially my friends whose job it is to\nbeat the market. I respect what they do. But this is what works\nfor us.\nWe invest money from every paycheck into these index funds\n—a combination of U.S. and international stocks. There’s no\nset goal—it’s just whatever is leftover after we spend. We max\nout retirement accounts in the same funds, and contribute to\nour kids’ 529 college savings plans.\nAnd that’s about it. Effectively all of our net worth is a house,\na checking account, and some Vanguard index funds.\nIt doesn’t need to be more complicated than that for us. I like\nit simple. One of my deeply held investing beliefs is that there\nis little correlation between investment effort and investment\nresults. The reason is because the world is driven by tails—a\nfew variables account for the majority of returns. No matter\nhow hard you try at investing you won’t do well if you miss\nthe two or three things that move the needle in your strategy.\nThe reverse is true. Simple investment strategies can work\ngreat as long as they capture the few things that are important\nto that strategy’s success. My investing strategy doesn’t rely\non picking the right sector, or timing the next recession. It\nrelies on a high savings rate, patience, and optimism that the\nglobal economy will create value over the next several\ndecades. I spend virtually all of my investing effort thinking\nabout those three things—especially the first two, which I can\ncontrol.\nI’ve changed my investment strategy in the past. So of course\nthere’s a chance I’ll change it in the future.\nNo matter how we save or invest I’m sure we’ll always have\nthe goal of independence, and we’ll always do whatever\nmaximizes for sleeping well at night.\nWe think it’s the ultimate goal; the mastery of the psychology\nof money.\nBut to each their own. No one is crazy."

    "raw_text": "To understand the psychology of the modern consumer and to graspwhere they might be heading next, you have to know how they gothere.\nHow we all got here.\nIf you fell asleep in 1945 and woke up in 2020 you would notrecognize the world around you.\nThe amount of economic growth that took place during that period isvirtually unprecedented. If you saw the level of wealth in New Yorkand San Francisco, you’d be shocked. If you compared it to thepoverty of Detroit, you’d be shocked. If you saw the price of homes,college tuition, and health care, you’d be shocked. If you saw howaverage Americans think about savings and spending in general,you’d be shocked. And if you tried to think of a reasonable narrativeof how it all happened, my guess is you’d be totally wrong. Becauseit isn’t intuitive, and it wasn’t foreseeable.\nWhat happened in America since the end of World War II is thestory of the American consumer. It’s a story that helps explain why\n\f\npeople think about money the way they do today.\nThe short story is this: Things were very uncertain, then they werevery good, then pretty bad, then really good, then really bad, andnow here we are. And there is, I think, a narrative that links all thoseevents together. Not a detailed account. But a story of how things fittogether.\nSince this is an attempt to link the big events together, it leaves outmany details of what happened during this period. I’m likely toagree with anyone who points out what I’ve missed. The goal here isnot to describe every play; it’s to look at how one game influencedthe next.\nHere’s how the modern consumer got here.\n \n \n1. August, 1945. World War II ends.\n \nJapan surrendering was “The Happiest Day in American History,”The New York Times wrote.\nBut there’s the saying, “History is just one damn thing afteranother.”\nThe joy of the war ending was quickly met with the question, “Whathappens now?”\nSixteen million Americans—11% of the population—served in thewar. About eight million were overseas at the end. Their average agewas 23. Within 18 months all but 1.5 million of them would behome and out of uniform.\nAnd then what?\nWhat were they going to do next?\nWhere were they going to work?\nWhere were they going to live?\nThose were the most important questions of the day, for two reasons.One, no one knew the answers. Two, if they couldn’t be answeredquickly, the most likely scenario—in the eyes of many economists—was that the economy would slip back into the depths of the GreatDepression.\nThree forces had built up during the war:\n\f\nHousing construction ground to a halt, as virtually all productioncapacity was shifted to building war supplies. Fewer than 12,000homes per month were built in 1943, equivalent to less than one newhome per American city. Returning soldiers faced a severe housingshortage.\n \nThe specific jobs created during the war—building ships, tanks, andplanes—were very suddenly not necessary after it, stopping with aspeed and magnitude rarely seen in private business. It was unclearwhere soldiers could work.\n \nThe marriage rate spiked during and immediately after the war.Soldiers didn’t want to return to their mother’s basement. Theywanted to start a family, in their own home, with a good job, rightaway.\n \nThis worried policymakers, especially since the Great Depressionwas still a recent memory, having ended just five years prior.\nIn 1946 the Council of Economic Advisors delivered a report toPresident Truman warning of “a full-scale depression some time inthe next one to four years.”\nThey wrote in a separate 1947 memo, summarizing a meeting withTruman:\n \nWe might be in some sort of recession period where we should haveto be very sure of our ground as to whether recessionary forcesmight be in danger of getting out of hand … There is a substantialprospect which should not be overlooked that a further decline mayincrease the danger of a downward spiral into depression conditions.\n \nThis fear was exacerbated by the fact that exports couldn’t beimmediately relied upon for growth, as two of the largest economies—Europe and Japan—sat in ruins dealing with humanitarian crises.And America itself was buried in more debt than ever before,limiting direct government stimulus.\nSo we did something about it."

    "raw_text": "2. Low interest rates and the intentional birth of the Americanconsumer.\n \nThe first thing we did to keep the economy afloat after the war waskeep interest rates low. This wasn’t an easy decision, because whensoldiers came home to a shortage of everything from clothes to carsit temporarily sent inflation into double digits.\nThe Federal Reserve was not politically independent before 1951. ⁷ ²The president and the Fed could coordinate policy. In 1942 the Fedannounced it would keep short-term rates at 0.38% to help financethe war. Rates didn’t budge a single basis point for the next sevenyears. Three-month Treasury yields stayed below 2% until the mid-1950s.\nThe explicit reason for keeping rates down was to keep the cost offinancing the equivalent of the $6 trillion we spent on the war low.\nBut low rates also did something else for all the returning GIs. Itmade borrowing to buy homes, cars, gadgets, and toys really cheap.\nWhich, from a paranoid policymaker’s perspective, was great.Consumption became an explicit economic strategy in the years afterWorld War II.\nAn era of encouraging thrift and saving to fund the war quicklyturned into an era of actively promoting spending. Princetonhistorian Sheldon Garon writes:\n \nAfter 1945, America again diverged from patterns of savingspromotion in Europe and East Asia … Politicians, businessmen andlabor leaders all encouraged Americans to spend to foster economic\ngrowth. ⁷ ³\n \nTwo things fueled this push.\nOne was the GI Bill, which offered unprecedented mortgageopportunities. Sixteen million veterans could buy a home often withno money down, no interest in the first year, and fixed rates so lowthat monthly mortgage payments could be lower than a rental.\nThe second was an explosion of consumer credit, enabled by theloosening of Depression-era regulations. The first credit card wasintroduced in 1950. Store credit, installment credit, personal loans,"

    "raw_text": "payday loans—everything took off. And interest on all debt,including credit cards, was tax deductible at the time.\nIt tasted delicious. So we ate a lot of it. A simple story in a simpletable:\n \n \nHousehold debt in the 1950s grew 1.5 times faster than it did duringthe 2000s debt splurge.\n \n3. Pent-up demand for stuff fed by a credit boom and a hidden1930s productivity boom led to an economic boom.\n \nThe 1930s were the hardest economic decade in American history.But there was a silver lining that took two decades to notice: Bynecessity, the Great Depression had supercharged resourcefulness,productivity, and innovation.\n\f\nWe didn’t pay that much attention to the productivity boom in the’30s, because everyone was focused on how bad the economy was.We didn’t pay attention to it in the ’40s, because everyone wasfocused on the war.\nThen the 1950s came around and we suddenly realized, “Wow, wehave some amazing new inventions. And we’re really good atmaking them.”\nAppliances, cars, phones, air conditioning, electricity.\nIt was nearly impossible to buy many household goods during thewar, because factories were converted to make guns and ships. Thatcreated pent-up demand from GIs for stuff after the war ended.Married, eager to get on with life, and emboldened with new cheapconsumer credit, they went on a buying spree like the country hadnever seen.\nFrederick Lewis Allen writes in his book The Big Change:\n \nDuring these postwar years the farmer bought a new tractor, a cornpicker, an electric milking machine; in fact he and his neighbors,between them, assembled a formidable array of farm machinery fortheir joint use. The farmer’s wife got the shining white electricrefrigerator she had always longed for and never during the GreatDepression had been able to afford, and an up-to-date washingmachine, and a deep-freeze unit. The suburban family installed adishwashing machine and invested in a power lawnmower. The cityfamily became customers of a laundromat and acquired a televisionset for the living room. The husband’s office was air-conditioned.And so on endlessly.\n \nIt’s hard to overstate how big this surge was.\nCommercial car and truck manufacturing virtually ceased from 1942to 1945. Then 21 million cars were sold from 1945 to 1949. Another37 million were sold by 1955.\nJust under two million homes were built from 1940 to 1945. Thenseven million were built from 1945 to 1950. Another eight millionwere built by 1955.\nPent-up demand for stuff, and our newfound ability to make stuff,created the jobs that put returning GIs back to work. And they weregood jobs, too. Mix that with consumer credit, and America’scapacity for spending exploded."

    "raw_text": "The Federal Reserve wrote to President Truman in 1951: “By 1950,total consumer expenditures, together with residential construction,amounted to about 203 billion dollars, or in the neighborhood of 40\npercent above the 1944 level.” ⁷⁴\nThe answer to the question, “What are all these GIs going to do afterthe war?” was now obvious. They were going to buy stuff, withmoney earned from their jobs making new stuff, helped by cheapborrowed money to buy even more stuff.\n \n4. Gains are shared more equally than ever before.\n \nThe defining characteristic of economics in the 1950s is that thecountry got rich by making the poor less poor.\nAverage wages doubled from 1940 to 1948, then doubled again by1963.\nAnd those gains focused on those who had been left behind fordecades before. The gap between rich and poor narrowed by anextraordinary amount.\nLewis Allen wrote in 1955:\n \nThe enormous lead of the well-to-do in the economic race has beenconsiderably reduced.\nIt is the industrial workers who as a group have done best—peoplesuch as a steelworker’s family who used to live on $2,500 and noware getting $4,500, or the highly skilled machine-tool operator’sfamily who used to have $3,000 and now can spend an annual$5,500 or more.\nAs for the top one percent, the really well-to-do and the rich, whomwe might classify very roughly indeed as the $16,000-and-overgroup, their share of the total national income, after taxes, had comedown by 1945 from 13 percent to 7 percent.\n \nThis was not a short-term trend. Real income for the bottom 20% ofwage-earners grew by a nearly identical amount as the top 5% from1950 to 1980.\nThe equality went beyond wages.\n\f\nWomen held jobs outside the home in record numbers. Their laborforce participation rate went from 31% after the war to 37% by1955, and to 40% by 1965.\nMinorities gained, too. After the 1945 inauguration EleanorRoosevelt wrote about an African American reporter who told her:\n \nDo you realize what twelve years have done? If at the 1933reception a number of colored people had gone down the line andmixed with everyone else in the way they did today, every paper inthe country would have reported it. We do not even think it is newsand none of us will mention it.\n \nWomen and minority rights were still a fraction of what they aretoday. But the progress toward equality in the late ’40s and ’50s wasextraordinary.\nThe leveling out of classes meant a leveling out of lifestyles. Normalpeople drove Chevys. Rich people drove Cadillacs. TV and radioequalized the entertainment and culture people enjoyed regardless ofclass. Mail-order catalogs equalized the clothes people wore and thegoods they bought regardless of where they lived. Harper’sMagazine noted in 1957:\n \nThe rich man smokes the same sort of cigarettes as the poor man,shaves with the same sort of razor, uses the same sort of telephone,vacuum cleaner, radio, and TV set, has the same sort of lighting andheating equipment in his house, and so on indefinitely. Thedifferences between his automobile and the poor man’s are minor.Essentially they have similar engines, similar fittings. In the earlyyears of the century there was a hierarchy of automobiles.\n \nPaul Graham wrote in 2016 about what something as simple as thereonly being three TV stations did to equalize culture:\n \nIt’s difficult to imagine now, but every night tens of millions offamilies would sit down together in front of their TV set watchingthe same show, at the same time, as their next door neighbors. Whathappens now with the Super Bowl used to happen every night. We\nwere literally in sync. ⁷⁵\n\f\nThis was important. People measure their well-being against theirpeers. And for most of the 1945–1980 period, people had a lot ofwhat looked like peers to compare themselves to. Many people—most people—lived lives that were either equal or at leastfathomable to those around them. The idea that people’s livesequalized as much as their incomes is an important point of thisstory we’ll come back to.\n \n5. Debt rose tremendously. But so did incomes, so the impactwasn’t a big deal.\n \nHousehold debt increased fivefold from 1947 to 1957 due to thecombination of the new consumption culture, new debt products,and interest rates subsidized by government programs, and held lowby the Federal Reserve.\nBut income growth was so strong during this period that the impacton households wasn’t severe. And household debt was so low tobegin with after the war. The Great Depression wiped out a lot of it,and household spending was so curtailed during the war that debtaccumulation was restricted. So the growth in household debt-to-income from 1947–1957 was manageable.\nHousehold debt-to-income today is just over 100%. Even after risingin the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, it stayed below 60%.\nDriving a lot of this debt boom was a surge in home ownership.\nThe homeownership rate in 1900 was 47%. It stayed right aboutthere for the next four decades. Then it took off, hitting 53% by1945 and 62% by 1970. A substantial portion of the population wasnow using debt that previous generations would not—could not—have accessed. And they were mostly OK with it.\nDavid Halberstam writes in his book The Fifties:\n \nThey were confident in themselves and their futures in a way that[those] growing up in harder times found striking. They did not feardebt as their parents had … They differed from their parents not justin how much they made and what they owned but in their belief thatthe future had already arrived. As the first homeowners in theirfamilies, they brought a new excitement and pride with them to the\n\f\nstore as they bought furniture or appliances—in other times youngcouples might have exhibited such feelings as they bought clothesfor their first baby. It was as if the very accomplishment of owning ahome reflected such an immense breakthrough that nothing was toogood to buy for it.\n \nNow’s a good time to connect a few things, as they’ll becomeincreasingly important:\n \n \nAmerica is booming.\n \nIt’s booming together like never before.\n \nIt’s booming with debt that isn’t a big deal at the time because it’sstill low relative to income and there’s a cultural acceptance thatdebt isn’t a scary thing.\n \n6. Things start cracking.\n \n1973 was the first year where it became clear the economy waswalking down a new path.\nThe recession that began that year brought unemployment to thehighest it had been since the 1930s.\nInflation surged. But unlike the post-war spikes, it stayed high.\nShort-term interest rates hit 8% in 1973, up from 2.5% a decadeearlier.\nAnd you have to put all of that in the context of how much fear therewas between Vietnam, riots, and the assassinations of Martin LutherKing, and John and Bobby Kennedy.\nIt got bleak.\nAmerica dominated the world economy in the two decades after thewar. Many of the largest countries had their manufacturing capacitybombed into rubble. But as the 1970s emerged, that changed. Japanwas booming. China’s economy was opening up. The Middle Eastwas flexing its oil muscles.\n\f\nA combination of lucky economic advantages and a culture sharedby the Greatest Generation—hardened by the Depression andanchored in systematic cooperation from the war—shifted whenBaby Boomers began coming of age. A new generation that had adifferent view of what’s normal hit at the same time a lot of theeconomic tailwinds of the previous two decades ended.\nEverything in finance is data within the context of expectations. Oneof the biggest shifts of the last century happened when the economicwinds began blowing in a different, uneven direction, but people’sexpectations were still rooted in a post-war culture of equality. Notnecessarily equality of income, although there was that. But equalityin lifestyle and consumption expectations; the idea that someoneearning a 50th percentile income shouldn’t live a life dramaticallydifferent than someone in the 80th or 90th percentile. And thatsomeone in the 99th percentile lived a better life, but still a life thatsomeone in the 50th percentile could comprehend. That’s howAmerica worked for most of the 1945–1980 period. It doesn’t matterwhether you think that’s morally right or wrong. It just matters that ithappened.\nExpectations always move slower than facts. And the economicfacts of the years between the early 1970s through the early 2000swere that growth continued, but became more uneven, yet people’sexpectations of how their lifestyle should compare to their peers didnot change.\n \n7. The boom resumes, but it’s different than before.\n \nRonald Reagan’s 1984 “Morning in America” ad declared:\n \nIt’s morning again in America. Today more men and women will goto work than ever before in our country’s history. With interest ratesat about half the record highs of 1980, nearly 2,000 families todaywill buy new homes, more than at any time in the past four years.This afternoon 6,500 young men and women will be married, andwith inflation at less than half of what it was just four years ago,they can look forward with confidence to the future.\n \nThat wasn’t hyperbole. GDP growth was the highest it had beensince the 1950s. By 1989 there were six million fewer unemployed"

    "raw_text": "Americans than there were seven years before. The S&P 500 rosealmost fourfold between 1982 and 1990. Total real GDP growth inthe 1990s was roughly equal to that of the 1950s—40% vs. 42%.\nPresident Clinton boasted in his 2000 State of the Union speech:\n \nWe begin the new century with over 20 million new jobs; the fastesteconomic growth in more than 30 years; the lowest unemploymentrates in 30 years; the lowest poverty rates in 20 years; the lowestAfrican-American and Hispanic unemployment rates on record; thefirst back-to-back surpluses in 42 years; and next month, Americawill achieve the longest period of economic growth in our entirehistory. We have built a new economy.\n \nHis last sentence was important. It was a new economy. The biggestdifference between the economy of the 1945–1973 period and that ofthe 1982–2000 period was that the same amount of growth found itsway into totally different pockets.\nYou’ve probably heard these numbers but they’re worth rehashing.The Atlantic writes:\n \nBetween 1993 and 2012, the top 1 percent saw their incomes grow86.1 percent, while the bottom 99 percent saw just 6.6 percentgrowth.\n \nJoseph Stiglitz in 2011:\n \nWhile the top 1 percent have seen their incomes rise 18 percent overthe past decade, those in the middle have actually seen their incomesfall. For men with only high-school degrees, the decline has beenprecipitous—12 percent in the last quarter-century alone.\n \nIt was nearly the opposite of the flattening that occurred after thewar.\nWhy this happened is one of the nastiest debates in economics,topped only by the debate over what we should do about it. Luckyfor the purpose of this discussion, neither matters."

    "raw_text": "All that matters is that sharp inequality became a force over the last35 years, and it happened during a period where, culturally,Americans held onto two ideas rooted in the post-WW2 economy:That you should live a lifestyle similar to most other Americans, andthat taking on debt to finance that lifestyle is acceptable.\n \n8. The big stretch.\n \nRising incomes among a small group of Americans led to that groupbreaking away in lifestyle.\nThey bought bigger homes, nicer cars, went to expensive schools,and took fancy vacations.\nAnd everyone else was watching—fueled by Madison Avenue in the’80s and ’90s, and the internet after that.\nThe lifestyles of a small portion of legitimately rich Americansinflated the aspirations of the majority of Americans, whose incomesweren’t rising.\nA culture of equality and togetherness that came out of the 1950s–1970s innocently morphs into a Keeping Up With The Joneseseffect.\nNow you can see the problem.\nJoe, an investment banker making $900,000 a year, buys a 4,000square foot house with two Mercedes and sends three of his kids toPepperdine. He can afford it.\nPeter, a bank branch manager making $80,000 a year, sees Joe andfeels a subconscious sense of entitlement to live a similar lifestyle,because Peter’s parents believed—and instilled in him—thatAmericans’ lifestyles weren’t that different even if they had differentjobs. His parents were right during their era, because incomes fellinto a tight distribution. But that was then. Peter lives in a differentworld. But his expectations haven’t changed much from his parents’,even if the facts have.\nSo what does Peter do?\nHe takes out a huge mortgage. He has $45,000 of credit card debt.He leases two cars. His kids will graduate with heavy student loans.He can’t afford the stuff Joe can, but he’s pushed to stretch for thesame lifestyle. It is a big stretch.\n\f\nThis would have seemed preposterous to someone in the 1930s. Butwe’ve spent 75 years since the end of the war fostering a culturalacceptance of household debt.\nDuring a time when median wages were flat, the median newAmerican home grew 50% larger.\n \n \nThe average new American home now has more bathrooms thanoccupants. Nearly half have four or more bedrooms, up from 18% in1983.\nThe average car loan adjusted for inflation more than doubledbetween 1975 and 2003, from $12,300 to $27,900.\nAnd you know what happened to college costs and student loans.\nHousehold debt-to-income stayed about flat from 1963 to 1973.Then it climbed, and climbed, and climbed, from around 60% in1973 to more than 130% by 2007.\n\f\nEven as interest rates plunged from the early 1980s through 2020,the percentage of income going to debt service payments rose. Andit skewed toward lower-income groups. The share of income goingtoward debt and lease payments is just over 8% for the highestincome groups—those with the biggest income gains—but over 21%for those below the 50th percentile.\nThe difference between this climbing debt and the debt increase thattook place during the 1950s and ’60s is that the recent jump startedfrom a high base.\nEconomist Hyman Minsky described the beginning of debt crises:The moment when people take on more debt than they can service.It’s an ugly, painful moment. It’s like Wile E. Coyote looking down,realizing he’s screwed, and falling precipitously.\nWhich, of course, is what happened in 2008.\n \n9. Once a paradigm is in place it is very hard to turn it around.\n \nA lot of debt was shed after 2008. And then interest rates plunged.Household debt payments as a percentage of income are now at thelowest levels in 35 years.\nBut the response to 2008, necessary as it may have been, perpetuatedsome of the trends that got us here.\nQuantitative easing both prevented economic collapse and boostedasset prices, a boon for those who owned them—mostly rich people.\nThe Fed backstopped corporate debt in 2008. That helped those whoowned that debt—mostly rich people.\nTax cuts over the last 20 years have predominantly gone to thosewith higher incomes. People with higher incomes send their kids tothe best colleges. Those kids can go on to earn higher incomes andinvest in corporate debt that will be backstopped by the Fed, ownstocks that will be supported by various government policies, and soon.\nNone of these things are problems in and of themselves, which iswhy they stay in place.\nBut they’re symptomatic of the bigger thing that’s happened sincethe early 1980s: The economy works better for some people thanothers. Success isn’t as meritocratic as it used to be and, when\n\f\nsuccess is granted, it’s rewarded with higher gains than in previouseras.\nYou don’t have to think that’s morally right or wrong.\nAnd, again, in this story it doesn’t matter why it happened.\nIt just matters that it did happen, and it caused the economy to shiftaway from people’s expectations that were set after the war: Thatthere’s a broad middle class without systematic inequality, whereyour neighbors next door and a few miles down the road live a lifethat’s pretty similar to yours.\nPart of the reason these expectations have stuck around for 35 yearsafter they shifted away from reality is because they felt so good forso many people when they were valid. Something that good—or atleast the impression that it was that good—isn’t easy to let go of.\nSo people haven’t let go of it. They want it back.\n \n10. The Tea Party, Occupy Wall Street, Brexit, and DonaldTrump each represents a group shouting, “Stop the ride, I wantoff.”\n \nThe details of their shouting are different, but they’re all shouting—at least in part—because stuff isn’t working for them within thecontext of the post-war expectation that stuff should work roughlythe same for roughly everyone.\nYou can scoff at linking the rise of Trump to income inequalityalone. And you should. These things are always layers of complexitydeep. But it’s a key part of what drives people to think, “I don’t livein the world I expected. That pisses me off. So screw this. Andscrew you! I’m going to fight for something totally different,because this—whatever it is—isn’t working.”\nTake that mentality and raise it to the power of Facebook, Instagram,and cable news—where people are more keenly aware of how otherpeople live than ever before. It’s gasoline on a flame. BenedictEvans says, “The more the Internet exposes people to new points ofview, the angrier people get that different views exist.” That’s a bigshift from the post-war economy where the range of economicopinions were smaller, both because the actual range of outcomeswas lower and because it wasn’t as easy to see and learn what otherpeople thought and how they lived."

    "raw_text": "I’m not pessimistic. Economics is the story of cycles. Things come,things go.\nThe unemployment rate is now the lowest it’s been in decades.Wages are now actually growing faster for low-income workers than\nthe rich. ⁷⁶  College costs by and large stopped growing once grants\nare factored in. ⁷⁷  If everyone studied advances in health care,communication, transportation, and civil rights since the Glorious1950s, my guess is most wouldn’t want to go back.\nBut a central theme of this story is that expectations move slowerthan reality on the ground. That was true when people clung to1950s expectations as the economy changed over the next 35 years.And even if a middle-class boom began today, expectations that theodds are stacked against everyone but those at the top may stickaround.\nSo the era of “This isn’t working” may stick around.\nAnd the era of “We need something radically new, right now,whatever it is” may stick around.\nWhich, in a way, is part of what starts events that led to things likeWorld War II, where this story began.\nHistory is just one damned thing after another.\n\f\n1 J.
