Schools of philosophy flourished in ancient Greece and provided a variety of options for parents sending their children for education. Among these schools were the Stoic school led by Zeno of Citium, the Cynic school led by Crates, and the Epicurean school under the guidance of Epicurus himself. The Painted Porch was a popular urban setting for Stoic lectures, whereas Epicurus's Garden had a more rural feel with the Epicureans growing their own vegetables. The Academy founded by Plato was located about a mile from the Agora and served as an idyllic location for philosophical discussions. Each school offered its unique perspective on life and philosophy, and today individuals seeking a personal philosophy of life can draw inspiration from these ancient teachings.
