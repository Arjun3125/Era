We were a convoy of Humvees, moving along the canal road in Iraq. The night was quiet, with only the rumble of diesel engines and the occasional distant bark of a dog giving any indication of life beyond the darkness that blanketed our surroundings. Intelligence reports suggested that a high-level terrorist leader was hiding in one of the nearby villages. We were tasked with capturing or eliminating him before he could carry out another attack.

The SEAL assault force, along with an element of Iraqi soldiers, dismounted from the vehicles and began to patrol up a narrow street between the high walls of residential compounds. The command vehicle arrived near the target building when someone yelled: "We've got a squirter!" Our EOD operator had spotted the individual fleeing the house and we couldn't allow him to escape. I was the ground force commander in charge of this operation, so together with our EOD operator, we sprinted after the man down a series of narrow alleyways, finally catching up with him near some residential compounds.

We quickly forced him to the ground and controlled his hands, but there were no weapons visible. He might have had a grenade in his pocket or worse, an explosive suicide belt hidden beneath his clothing. We couldn't take any chances given the level of threat posed by this individual. So we searched him thoroughly and quickly to make sure he wasn't hiding anything dangerous.

In that moment, I realized that we were completely isolated from our unit. The rest of the SEAL assault force didn't know where we were, and there hadn't been enough time to notify them. Darkened windows and rooftops surrounded us, hinting at potential enemy fighters lurking nearby, preparing for an ambush.
