Any team, group or organization, the proper understanding and execution of these Laws of Combat would mean one thing: victory.
LEADERSHIP: THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR Leif Babin and Jocko Willink This book is about leadership. It was written for leaders of teams large and small, for men and women, for any person who aspires to better themselves. Though it contains exciting accounts of SEAL combat operations, this book is not a war memoir.

If it serves as a useful guide to leaders who aspire to build, train and lead high-performance winning teams, then it has accomplished its purpose.
Among the legions of leadership books in publication, we found most focus on individual practices and personal character traits. We also observed that many corporate leadership training programs and management consulting firms do the same. But without a team - a group of individuals working to accomplish a mission - there can be no leadership. The only meaningful measure for a leader is whether the team succeeds or fails. For all the definitions, descriptions and characterizations of leaders, there are only two that matter: effective and ineffective. Effective leaders lead successful teams that accomplish their mission and win. Ineffective leaders do not.
The principles and concepts described in this book, when properly understood and implemented, enable any leader to become effective and dominate his or her battlefield. Every leader and every team at some point or time will fail and must confront that failure. That too is a big part of this book. We are by no means infallible leaders; no one is, no matter how experienced. Nor do we have all the answers; no leader does. We’ve made huge mistakes. Often our mistakes provided the greatest lessons, humbled us and enabled us to grow and become better. For
