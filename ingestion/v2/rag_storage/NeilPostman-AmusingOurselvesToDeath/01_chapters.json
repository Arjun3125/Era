    "raw_text": "Introduction to  the Twentieth Anniversary Edition \nNow this? \nA book  of  social  commentary  published  twenty  years  ago? \nYou're  not  busy  enough  writing  e-mails,  returning  calls,  down-\nloading  tunes,  playing  games  (online,  PlayStation,  Game  Boy), \nchecking  out  Web  sites,  sending  text  messages,  IM'ing,  Tivoing, \nwatching  what  you've  Tivoed,  browsing  through  magazines \nand newspapers,  reading  new books—now  you've  got  to  stop \nand read  a  book  that  first  appeared  in  the  last  century,  not  to \nmention  the  last  millennium?  Come  on.  Like  your  outlook  on \ntoday  could  seriously  be  rocked  by  this  plain-spoken  provoca-\ntion about  The  World  of  1985,  a  world  yet  to  be  infiltrated  by \nthe Internet,  cell  phones,  PDAs,  cable  channels  by  the  hun-\ndreds,  DVDs,  call-waiting,  caller  ID,  blogs,  flat-screens,  HDTV, \nand iPods?  Is  it  really  plausible  that  this  slim  volume,  with  its \nonce-urgent  premonitions  about  the  nuanced  and  deep-seated \nperils  of television,  could  feel  timely  today,  the  Age  of Comput-\ners? Is  it really  plausible  that  this  book  about  how  TV  is turn-\ning all public  life  (education,  religion,  politics,  journalism)  into \nentertainment;  how  the  image  is  undermining  other  forms  of \ncommunication,  particularly  the  written  word;  and  how  our \nbottomless  appetite  for  TV  will  make  content  so  abundantly \navailable,  context  be  damned,  that  we'll  be  overwhelmed  by \n\"information  glut\"  until  what  is  truly  meaningful  is  lost  and \nwe no  longer  care  what  we've  lost  as  long  as  we're  being \namused.  .  . . Can  such  a  book  possibly  have  relevance  to  you \nand The  World  of  2006  and  beyond? \nvii\n\f\nIntroduction to  the Twentieth Anniversary Edition  viii \nI think  you've  answered  your  own  question. \nI, too,  think  the  answer  is  yes, but  as  Neil  Postman's  son,  I'm \nbiased.  Where  are  we  to  find  objective  corroboration  that  read-\ning Amusing Ourselves  to Death in  2006,  in  a society  that  worships \nTV and  technology  as  ours  does,  is  nearly  an  act  of  defiance, \none of those  I-didn't-realize-it-was-dark-until-someone-flipped-\nthe-switch  encounters  with  an  illuminating  intellect?  Let's  not \ntake  the  word  of  those  who  studied  under  my  father  at  New \nYork University,  many  of  whom  have  gone  on  to  teach  in  their \nown  college  (and  occasionally  high  school)  courses  what  he \nargues  in  these  pages.  These  fine  minds  are,  as  my  father's \nwas, of  a  bygone  era,  a  different  media  environment,  and  their \nbiases  may  make  them,  as  they  made  him,  hostage  of  another \ntime,  perhaps  incapable  of  seeing  the  present  world  as  it  is \nrather  than  as  they'd  like  it  to  be.  (One  man's  R  rating  is  an-\nother's  PG-13.)  And  just  to  make  a  clean  slate  of  it,  let's  not \nrely, either,  on  the  opinions  of  the  numerous  readers  of  the \noriginal  edition  of  Amusing Ourselves  to Death (translated  into  a \ndozen  languages,  including  German,  Indonesian,  Turkish, \nDanish  and,  most  recently,  Chinese),  so  many  of  whom  wrote \nto my  father,  or  buttonholed  him  at  public  speaking  events,  to \ntell him  how  dead-on  his  argument  was.  Their  support,  while \ngenuine,  was  expressed  over  the  last  two  decades,  so  some  of \nit might  be  outdated.  We'll  disregard  the  views  of  these  teach-\ners and  students,  businesspeople  and  artists,  conservatives  and \nliberals,  atheists  and  churchgoers,  and  all  those  parents.  (We'll \nalso disregard  Roger  Waters,  cofounder  of  the  legendary  band \nPink Floyd,  whose  solo  album,  Amused  to  Death, was  inspired \nby the  book.  Go,  Dad.) \nSo whose  opinion  matters? \nIn rereading  this  book  to  figure  out  what  might  be  said \nabout  it  twenty  years  later,  I  tried  to  think  the  way  my  father \nwould,  since  he  could  no  longer.  He  died  in  October  2003,  at \nage seventy-two.  Channeling  him,  I  realized  immediately  who\n\f\nIntroduction to  the Twentieth Anniversary Edition ix \noffers  the  best  test  of whether  Amusing  Ourselves  to Death is  still \nrelevant. \nCollege  kids. \nToday's  eighteen-to-twenty-two-year-olds  live  in  a  vastly \ndifferent  media  environment  from  the  one  that  existed  in \n1985.  Their  relationship  to  TV differs.  Back  then,  MTV  was  in \nits late  infancy.  Today,  news  scrolls  and  corner-of-the-screen \npromos  and  \"reality\"  shows  and  infomercials  and  nine  hun-\ndred  channels  are  the  norm.  And  TV  no  longer  dominates  the \nmedia  landscape.  \"Screen  time\"  also  means  hours  spent  in \nfront  of  the  computer,  video  monitor,  cell  phone,  and  hand-\nheld.  Multitasking  is standard.  Communities  have  been  replaced \nby demographics.  Silence  has  been  replaced  by  background \nnoise.  It's  a different  world. \n(It's different  for  all  of us,  of course—children,  young  teens, \nparents,  seniors—but  college  kids  form  an  especially  rich \ngrouping,  poised  between  innocence  and  sophistication,  re-\nspect  and  irreverence.) \nWhen  today's  students  are  assigned  Amusing  Ourselves  to \nDeath, almost  none  of  them  have  heard  of  Neil  Postman  or \nbeen  exposed  to  his  ideas  (he  wrote  more  than  twenty  books, \non such  subjects  as  education,  language,  childhood,  and  tech-\nnology),  suggesting  that  their  views,  besides  being  pertinent, \nare relatively  uncorrupted.  I  called  several  of  my  father's  for-\nmer  students  who  are  now  teachers,  and  who  teach  Amusing \nOurselves to Death in courses  that  examine  some  cross-section  of \nideas  about  TV,  culture,  computing,  technology,  mass  media, \ncommunications,  politics,  journalism,  education,  religion,  and \nlanguage.  I  asked  the  teachers  what  their  students  thought  of \nthe  book,  particularly  its  timeliness.  The  teachers  were  kind \nenough  to  share  many  of their  students'  thoughts,  from  papers \nand  class  discussion. \n\"In the  book  [Postman]  makes  the  point  that  there  is  no  re-\nflection time  in  the  world  anymore,\"  said  a  student  named\n\f\nIntroduction to  the Twentieth Anniversary Edition x \nJonathan.  \"When  I  go  to  a  restaurant,  everyone's  on  their  cell \nphone,  talking  or  playing  games.  I  have  no  ability  to  sit  by my-\nself and  just  think.\"  Said  Liz: \"It's  more relevant  now.  In  class we \nasked  if,  now  that  there's  cable,  which  there  really  wasn't  when \nthe  book  was  written,  are  there  channels  that  are  not  just  about \nentertainment?  We  tried  to  find  one  to  disprove  his  theory.  One \nkid said  the  Weather  Channel  but  another  mentioned  how  they \nhave  all  those  shows  on  tornadoes  and  try  to  make  weather \nfun.  The  only  good  example  we  came  up  with  was  C-SPAN, \nwhich  no  one  watches.\"  Cara:  \"Teachers  are  not  considered \ngood if  they  don't  entertain  their  classes.\"  Remarked  Ben \n(whose  professor  called  him  the  \"class  skeptic,\"  and  who,  when \nthe  book  was  assigned,  groaned,  \"Why  do  we  have  to  read \nthis?\"):  \"Postman  says  TV makes  everything  about  the  present— \nand  there  we  were,  criticizing  the  book  because  it  wasn't  pub-\nlished  yesterday.\"  Reginald:  \"This  book  is  not  just  about  TV.\" \nSandra:  \"The  book  was  absolutely  on  target  about  the  2004  pres-\nidential  election  campaign  and  debates.\"  One  student  pointed \nout  that  Arnold  Schwarzenegger  announced  his  candidacy  for \nthe  California  governorship  on  The  Tonight Show. Maria  noted \nthat  the  oversimplification  and  thinking  \"fragmentation\"  pro-\nmoted  by  TV-watching  may  have  contributed  to  our  Red  State/ \nBlue  State  polarization.  Another  noted  the  emergence  of  a \nnew  series  of  \"Bible  magazines,\"  whose  cover  format  is  mod-\neled on  teen  magazines,  with  cover  lines  like  \"Top  10  Tips  to \nGetting  Closer  to  God\"—\"it's  religion  mimicking  an  MTV  kind \nof world,\"  said  the  student.  Others  wondered  if  the  recent \nsurge  in  children  diagnosed  with  attention  deficit  disorder  was \nan indication  of  a  need  to  be  constantly  stimulated. \nKaitlin  switched  her  major  to  print  journalism  after  reading \nthe  book.  Andrea  would  recommend  it  to  anyone  concerned \nwith  media  ethics.  Mike  said  even  those  who  won't  agree  with \nthe  book's  arguments—as  he  did  not—should  still  read  it,  to  be \nprovoked.  Many  students  (\"left  wingers  and  right  wingers \nboth,\"  said  the  professor)  were  especially  taken  with  my  fa-\n\f\nIntroduction to the Twentieth Anniversary Edition xi \nther's  \"Now  .  . . this\"  idea:  the  phenomenon  whereby  the  re-\nporting  of a horrific  event—a  rape  or  a five-alarm  fire  or  global \nwarming—is  followed  immediately  by  the  anchor's  cheerfully \nexclaiming  \"Now  .  . . this,\"  which  segues  into  a  story  about \nJanet  Jackson's  exposed  nipple  or  a  commercial  for  lite  beer, \ncreating  a  sequencing  of  information  so  random,  so  disparate \nin scale  and  value,  as  to  be  incoherent,  even  psychotic. \nAnother  teacher  remarked  that  students  love  how the  book  is \ntold—by  a writer  who's  at  heart  a storyteller.  \"They  love  that  he \nrefers  to  books  and  people  they've  heard  of,\"  she  said.  Alison: \n\"He doesn't  dumb  it  down—he  makes  allusions  to  great  art  and \npoetry.\"  Matt  said  that,  ironically,  \"Postman  proves  you  can  be \nentertaining—and  without  a  single  picture.\"  Of  her  students' \nimpressions,  one  teacher  said,  \"He  speaks  to  them  without  jar-\ngon, in  a  way  in  which  they  feel  respected.  They  feel  he's  just \nhaving  a conversation  with  them,  but  inspiring  them  to  think  at \nthe same  time.\"  Another  professor  noted  that  \"kids  come  to  the \nconclusion  that  TV  is almost  exclusively  interested  in  present-\ning show  business  and  sensationalism  and  in  making  money. \nAmazing  as  it  seems,  they  had  never  realized  that  before.\" \nIt no  doubt  appears  to  you  that,  after  all my  grand  talk  of ob-\njectivity,  I've  stacked  the  deck  in  favor  of the  book's  virtue.  But \nthat's  honestly  the  overwhelming  reaction—at  least  among  a \nslice of Generation  Y, a population  segment  that  one  can  imag-\nine has  as  many  reasons  not to  like  the  book  as  to  like  it.  One \nprofessor  said that  in  a typical  class  of twenty-five  students  who \nread the  book,  twenty-three  will  write  papers  that  either  praise, \nor are  animated  by,  its ideas;  two  will  say  the  book  was  a  stupid \nwaste  of  time.  A  92  percent  rating?  There's  no  one  who  ex-\npresses  an  idea—certainly  no  politician—who  wouldn't  take \nthat  number. \nOf course,  students  had  criticisms  of  the  book,  too.  Many \ndidn't  appreciate  the  assault  on  television—a  companion  to \nthem,  a  source  of  pleasure  and  comfort—and  felt  as  if  they \nhad to  defend  their  culture.  Some  considered  TV  their  parents'\n\f\nIntroduction to  the Twentieth Anniversary Edition xii \nculture,  not  theirs—they  are  of the  Internet—so  the  book's  the-\nses were  less  relevant.  Some  thought  my  father  was  anti-change, \nthat  he  so  exalted  the  virtues  fostered  by the  written  word  and  its \nculture,  he  was  not  open  to  acknowledging  many  of the  positive \nsocial improvements  TV  had  brought  about,  and  what  a  demo-\ncratic  and  leveling  force  it could  be.  Some  disagreed  with  his  as-\nsessment  that  TV  is  in  complete  charge:  remote  control,  an \nabundance  of  channels,  and  VCRs  and  DVRs  all  enable  you  to \n\"customize\"  your  programming,  even  to  skip  commercials.  A \ncommon  critique  was  that  he  should  have  offered  solutions;  you \ncan't  put  the  toothpaste  back  in  the  tube,  after  all, so what  now? \nAnd  there  was  this:  Yeah,  what  he  said  in  1985  had  come \nstartlingly  true,  we  had  amused  ourselves  to  death  .  . . so why \nread  it? \nOne  professor  uses  the  book  in  conjunction  with  an  experi-\nment  she  calls  an  \"e-media  fast.\"  For  twenty-four  hours,  each \nstudent  must  refrain  from  electronic  media.  When  she  an-\nnounces  the  assignment,  she  told  me,  90  percent  of  the  stu-\ndents  shrug,  thinking  it's  no  big  deal.  But  when  they  realize  all \nthe  things  they  must  give  up  for  a  whole  day—cell  phone, \ncomputer,  Internet,  TV,  car  radio,  etc.—\"they  start  to  moan \nand  groan.\"  She  tells  them  they  can  still  read  books.  She  ac-\nknowledges  it  will  be  a  tough  day,  though  for  roughly  eight  of \nthe  twenty-four  hours  they'll  be  asleep.  She  says  if they  break \nthe  fast—if  they  answer  the  phone,  say,  or  simply  have  to \ncheck  e-mail—they  must  begin  from  scratch. \n\"The papers  I  get  back  are  amazing,\"  says  the  professor. \n\"They  have  titles  like  'The  Worst  Day  of  My  Life'  or  'The  Best \nExperience  I  Ever  Had,'  always  extreme.  'I  thought  I  was going \nto die,'  they'll  write.  'I  went  to  turn  on  the  TV but  if  I did I  re-\nalized,  my  God,  I'd  have  to  start  all  over  again.'  Each  student \nhas his  or  her  own  weakness—for  some  it's  TV, some  the  cell \nphone,  some  the  Internet  or  their  PDA.  But  no  matter  how \nmuch  they  hate  abstaining,  or  how  hard  it  is to hear  the  phone \nring  and  not  answer  it,  they  take  time  to  do  things  they"

They  have  extended  conversations.  One \nwrote,  'I  thought  to  do  things  I  hadn't  thought  to  do  ever.'  The \nexperience  changes  them.  Some  are  so  affected  that  they  de-\ntermine  to  fast  on  their  own,  one  day  a  month.  In  that  course \nI take  them  through  the  classics—from  Plato  and  Aristotle \nthrough  today—and  years  later,  when  former  students  write \nor call  to  say  hello,  the  thing  they  remember  is  the  media  fast.\" \nLike the  media  fast,  Amusing Ourselves  to Death is  a call  to  ac-\ntion.  It  is, in  my  father's  words,  \"an  inquiry  .  . . and  a  lamenta-\ntion,\"  yes,  but  it  aspires  to  greater  things.  It  is an exhortation  to \ndo something.  It's  a  counterpunch  to  what  my  father  thought \ndaily TV news  was:  \"inert,  consisting  of  information  that  gives \nus something  to  talk  about  but  cannot  lead  to  any  meaningful \naction.\"  Dad  was  a  lover  of  history,  a  champion  for  collective \nmemory  and  what  we  now  quaintly  refer  to  as  \"civilizing  in-\nfluences,\" but  he  did  not  live  in  the  past.  His  book  urges  us  to \nclaim a  way  to  be  more  alert  and  engaged.  His  ideas  are  still \nhere,  he  isn't,  and  it's  time  for  the  reins  to  be  grabbed  by  those \nof a  new  generation,  natives  of  this  brave  new  world  who  un-\nderstand  it  better. \nTwenty  years  isn't  what  it  used  to  be.  Where  once  it  stood \nfor a single  generation,  now  it  seems  to  stand  for  three.  Every-\nthing  moves  faster.  \"Change  changed,\"  my  father  wrote  in  an-\nother  book. \nA lot has  changed  since  this  book  appeared.  News  consump-\ntion  among  the  young  is  way  down.  Network  news  and  enter-\ntainment  divisions  are  far  more  entwined,  despite  protests \n(some  genuine,  some  perhaps  not)  by  the  news  divisions. \nWhen  Jon  Stewart,  host  of  Comedy  Central's  The  Daily Show, \nwent  on  CNN's  Crossfire  to  make  this  very  point—that  serious \nnews  and  show  business  ought  to  be  distinguishable,  for  the \nsake of  public  discourse  and  the  republic—the  hosts  seemed \nincapable  of  even  understanding  the  words  coming  out  of  his\n\f\nIntroduction to  the Twentieth Anniversary Edition xiv \nmouth.  The  sound  bite  is  now  more  like  a  sound  nibble,  and \nit's rare,  even  petulant,  to  hear  someone  challenge  its  absurd \ninsubstantiality;  \"the  question  of  how  television  affects  us has \nreceded  into  the  background\"  (Dad's  words,  not  mine,  from \n1985).  Fox  News  has  established  itself,  and  thrived.  Corporate \nconglomeration  is  up,  particularly  among  media  companies. \nOur own  media  companies  don't  provide  truly  gruesome  war \nimages  as  part  of  the  daily  news,  but  then  they  didn't  do  so \ntwenty  years  ago  either  (though  forty  years  ago  they  did).  The \nquality  of  graphics  (i.e.,  the  reality  quotient)  of  computer  and \nvideo  games  is  way  up.  Communities  exist  that  didn't,  thanks \nto the  Internet,  particularly  peer-to-peer  computing.  A  new \nkind  of  collaborative  creativity  abounds,  thanks  to  the  \"open \nsource\"  movement,  which  gave  us  the  Linux  operating  system. \nHowever,  other  communities  are  collapsing:  Far  fewer  people \njoin  clubs  that  meet  regularly,  fewer  families  eat  dinner  to-\ngether,  and  people  don't  have  friends  over  or  know  their \nneighbors  the  way  they  used  to.  More  school  administrators \nand  politicians  and  business  executives  hanker  to  wire  schools \nfor computers,  as  if that  is  the  key  to  improving  American  ed-\nucation.  The  number  of  hours  the  average  American  watches \nTV has  remained  steady,  at  about  four  and  a  half  hours  a  day, \nevery  day  (by  age  sixty-five,  a  person  will  have  spent  twelve \nuninterrupted  years  in  front  of  the  TV).  Childhood  obesity  is \nway  up.  Some  things  concern  our  children  more  than  they \nused  to,  some  not  at  all.  Maybe  there's  more  hope  than  there \nwas,  maybe  less.  Maybe  the  amount  is  a constant. \nSubstantive  as  this  book  is,  it  was  predicated  on  a  \"hook\": \nthat  one  British  writer  (George  Orwell)  with  a  frightening  vi-\nsion  of the  future,  a vision  that  many  feared  would  come  true, \nwas mostly  off-base,  while  another  British  writer  (Aldous \nHuxley)  with  a  frightening  vision  of  the  future,  a  vision  less \nwell-known  and  less  feared,  was  scarily  on  target.  My  father \nargued  his  point,  persuasively,  but  it  was  a  point  for  another \ntime—the  Age  of  Television.  New  technologies  and  media  are\n\f\nIntroduction to  the Twentieth Anniversary Edition xv \nin the  ascendancy.  Fortunately—and  this,  more  than  anything, \nis what  I  think  makes  Amusing  Ourselves  to Death so  emphati-\ncally relevant—my  father  asked  such  good  questions  that  they \ncan be  asked  of non-television  things,  of  all  sorts  of transform-\ning developments  and  events  that  have  happened  since  1985, \nand  since  his  death,  and  of  things  still  unformed,  for  genera-\ntions  to  come  (though  \"generations  to  come\"  may  someday \nmean  a  span  of three  years).  His  questions  can  be  asked  about \nall technologies  and  media.  What  happens  to  us  when  we  be-\ncome  infatuated  with  and  then  seduced  by  them?  Do  they  free \nus or  imprison  us?  Do  they  improve  or  degrade  democracy? \nDo they  make  our  leaders  more  accountable  or  less  so?  Our \nsystem  more  transparent  or  less  so?  Do  they  make  us  better \ncitizens  or  better  consumers?  Are  the  trade-offs  worth  it?  If \nthey're  not  worth  it,  yet  we  still  can't  stop  ourselves  from  em-\nbracing  the  next  new  thing  because  that's  just  how  we're \nwired,  then  what  strategies  can  we  devise  to  maintain  control? \nDignity?  Meaning?  My  father  was  not  a  curmudgeon  about  all \nthis, as  some  thought.  It  was  never  optimism  he  lacked;  it  was \ncertainty.  \"We  must  be  careful  in  praising  or  condemning  be-\ncause  the  future  may  hold  surprises  for  us,\"  he  wrote.  Nor  did \nhe fear  TV across  the  board  (as  some  thought).  Junk  television \nwas fine.  \"The  A-Team and  Cheers  are  no  threat  to  our  public \nhealth,\"  he  wrote.  \"60  Minutes,  Eyewitness  News,  and  Sesame \nStreet are.\" \nA student  of Dad's, a teacher  himself,  says his own  students  are \nmore  responsive  to  Amusing Ourselves  to Death, not  less,  than  they \nwere five or  ten  years  ago.  \"When  the  book  first  came  out,  it  was \nahead  of  its  time,  and  some  people  didn't  understand  its  reach,\" \nhe says.  \"It's a twenty-first  century  book  published  in  the  twenti-\neth century.\"  In 1986,  soon  after  the  book  was  published  and  had \nstarted  to  make  ripples,  Dad  was  on  ABC's  Nightline,  discussing \nwith  Ted Koppel  the  effect  TV can have  on  society  if we let  it con-\ntrol us, rather  than  vice  versa.  As I recall, at  one  juncture,  to  illus-\ntrate  his  point  that  our  brief  attention  span  and  our  appetite  for\n\f\nIntroduction to  the Twentieth Anniversary  Edition xvi \nfeel-good  content  can  short-circuit  any  meaningful  discourse, \nDad said,  \"For  example,  Ted,  we're  having  an  important  discus-\nsion about  the  culture  but  in  thirty  seconds  we'll  have  to  break \nfor a commercial  to  sell  cars  or  toothpaste.\" \nMr. Koppel,  one  of  the  rare  serious  figures  on  network  tele-\nvision,  smiled  wryly—or  was  it  fatigue? \n\"Actually,  Dr.  Postman,\"  he  said,  \"it's  more  like  ten  seconds.\" \nThere's  still  time. \nAndrew Postman \nBrooklyn, New  York \nNovember 2005"

    "raw_text": "Foreword \nWe were  keeping  our  eye  on  1984.  When  the  year  came  and \nthe prophecy  didn't,  thoughtful  Americans  sang  softly  in praise \nof themselves.  The  roots  of  liberal  democracy  had  held.  Wher-\never else  the  terror  had  happened,  we,  at  least,  had  not  been \nvisited by  Orwellian  nightmares. \nBut we  had  forgotten  that  alongside  Orwell's  dark  vision, \nthere  was  another—slightly  older,  slightly  less  well  known, \nequally  chilling:  Aldous  Huxley's  Brave New World.  Contrary  to \ncommon  belief  even  among  the  educated,  Huxley  and  Orwell \ndid not  prophesy  the  same  thing.  Orwell  warns  that  we  will  be \novercome  by an  externally  imposed  oppression.  But  in  Huxley's \nvision,  no  Big  Brother  is  required  to  deprive  people  of  their  au-\ntonomy,  maturity  and  history.  As  he saw  it,  people  will  come  to \nlove their  oppression,  to  adore  the  technologies  that  undo  their \ncapacities  to  think. \nWhat  Orwell  feared  were  those  who  would  ban  books.  What \nHuxley  feared  was  that  there  would  be  no  reason  to  ban  a  book, \nfor there  would  be  no  one  who  wanted  to  read  one.  Orwell \nfeared  those  who  would  deprive  us  of  information.  Huxley \nfeared  those  who  would  give  us  so  much  that  we  would  be \nreduced  to  passivity  and  egoism.  Orwell  feared  that  the  truth \nwould  be  concealed  from  us.  Huxley  feared  the  truth  would  be \ndrowned  in  a  sea  of  irrelevance.  Orwell  feared  we  would  be-\ncome  a  captive  culture.  Huxley  feared  we  would  become  a  triv-\nial culture,  preoccupied  with  some  equivalent  of  the  feelies,  the \norgy porgy,  and  the  centrifugal  bumblepuppy.  As  Huxley  re-\nxix\n\f\nForeword xx \nmarked  in  Brave  New  World  Revisited, the  civil  libertarians  and \nrationalists  who  are  ever  on  the  alert  to  oppose  tyranny  \"failed \nto take  into  account  man's  almost  infinite  appetite  for  distrac-\ntions.\"  In  1984,  Huxley  added,  people  are  controlled  by  inflict-\ning pain.  In  Brave  New  World,  they  are  controlled  by  inflicting \npleasure.  In  short,  Orwell  feared  that  what  we  hate  will  ruin  us. \nHuxley  feared  that  what  we  love  will  ruin  us. \nThis book  is  about  the  possibility  that  Huxley,  not  Orwell, \nwas right."

    "raw_text": "Part I.\n\f\nAt different  times  in  our  history,  different  cities  have  been  the \nfocal point  of  a radiating  American  spirit.  In  the  late  eighteenth \ncentury,  for  example,  Boston  was  the  center  of  a political  radi-\ncalism  that  ignited  a  shot  heard  round  the  world—a  shot  that \ncould  not  have  been  fired  any  other  place  but  the  suburbs  of \nBoston.  At  its  report,  all  Americans,  including  Virginians,  be-\ncame  Bostonians  at  heart.  In  the  mid-nineteenth  century,  New \nYork became  the  symbol  of the  idea  of a melting-pot  America— \nor at  least  a  non-English  one—as  the  wretched  refuse  from  all \nover the  world  disembarked  at  Ellis  Island  and  spread  over  the \nland their  strange  languages  and  even  stranger  ways.  In  the \nearly twentieth  century,  Chicago,  the  city  of  big  shoulders  and \nheavy  winds,  came  to  symbolize  the  industrial  energy  and  dy-\nnamism  of  America.  If  there  is  a statue  of  a  hog  butcher  some-\nwhere  in  Chicago,  then  it  stands  as a reminder  of the  time  when \nAmerica  was  railroads,  cattle,  steel  mills  and  entrepreneurial \nadventures.  If  there  is  no  such  statue,  there  ought  to  be,  just  as \nthere  is a statue  of a Minute  Man  to  recall  the  Age  of Boston,  as \nthe Statue  of  Liberty  recalls  the  Age  of New  York. \nToday,  we  must  look  to  the  city  of  Las  Vegas,  Nevada,  as  a \nmetaphor  of  our  national  character  and  aspiration,  its  symbol  a \nthirty-foot-high  cardboard  picture  of  a slot  machine  and  a  cho-\nrus girl.  For  Las  Vegas  is  a  city  entirely  devoted  to  the  idea  of \nentertainment,  and  as  such  proclaims  the  spirit  of  a  culture  in \nwhich  all  public  discourse  increasingly  takes  the  form  of enter-\ntainment.  Our  politics,  religion,  news,  athletics,  education  and \n3 \nThe Medium Is the Metaphor \nI.\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to Death 4 \ncommerce  have  been  transformed  into  congenial  adjuncts  of \nshow  business,  largely  without  protest  or  even  much  popular \nnotice.  The  result  is  that  we  are  a people  on  the  verge  of amus-\ning ourselves  to  death. \nAs I write,  the  President  of  the  United  States  is a former  Hol-\nlywood  movie  actor.  One  of  his  principal  challengers  in  1984 \nwas once  a  featured  player  on  television's  most  glamorous \nshow  of  the  1960's,  that  is  to  say,  an  astronaut.  Naturally,  a \nmovie  has  been  made  about  his  extraterrestrial  adventure.  For-\nmer  nominee  George  McGovern  has  hosted  the  popular  televi-\nsion  show  \"Saturday  Night  Live.\"  So  has  a  candidate  of  more \nrecent  vintage,  the  Reverend  Jesse  Jackson. \nMeanwhile,  former  President  Richard  Nixon,  who  once \nclaimed  he  lost  an  election  because  he  was  sabotaged  by  make-\nup men,  has  offered  Senator  Edward  Kennedy  advice  on how  to \nmake  a  serious  run  for  the  presidency:  lose  twenty  pounds.  Al-\nthough  the  Constitution  makes  no  mention  of  it,  it  would  ap-\npear  that  fat  people  are  now  effectively  excluded  from  running \nfor high  political  office.  Probably  bald  people  as  well.  Almost \ncertainly  those  whose  looks  are  not  significantly  enhanced  by \nthe  cosmetician's  art.  Indeed,  we  may  have  reached  the  point \nwhere  cosmetics  has  replaced  ideology  as  the  field  of  expertise \nover  which  a  politician  must  have  competent  control. \nAmerica's  journalists,  i.e.,  television  newscasters,  have  not \nmissed  the  point.  Most  spend  more  time  with  their  hair  dryers \nthan  with  their  scripts,  with  the  result  that  they  comprise  the \nmost  glamorous  group  of  people  this  side  of  Las  Vegas.  Al-\nthough  the  Federal  Communications  Act  makes  no  mention  of \nit, those  without  camera  appeal  are  excluded  from  addressing \nthe  public  about  what  is  called  \"the  news  of  the  day.\"  Those \nwith  camera  appeal  can  command  salaries  exceeding  one  mil-\nlion dollars  a  year. \nAmerican  businessmen  discovered,  long  before  the  rest  of us, \nthat  the  quality  and  usefulness  of their  goods  are  subordinate  to \nthe  artifice  of  their  display;  that,  in  fact,  half  the  principles  of\n\f\nThe Medium Is  the Metaphor 5 \ncapitalism  as  praised  by  Adam  Smith  or  condemned  by  Karl \nMarx are  irrelevant.  Even  the  Japanese,  who  are  said  to  make \nbetter  cars  than  the  Americans,  know  that  economics  is  less  a \nscience  than  a  performing  art,  as  Toyota's  yearly  advertising \nbudget  confirms. \nNot long  ago,  I  saw  Billy  Graham  join  with  Shecky  Green, \nRed Buttons,  Dionne  Warwick,  Milton  Berle  and  other  theolo-\ngians  in  a tribute  to  George  Burns,  who  was  celebrating  himself \nfor surviving  eighty  years  in  show  business.  The  Reverend \nGraham  exchanged  one-liners  with  Burns  about  making  prepa-\nrations  for  Eternity.  Although  the  Bible  makes  no  mention  of  it, \nthe Reverend  Graham  assured  the  audience  that  God  loves \nthose  who  make  people  laugh.  It  was  an  honest  mistake.  He \nmerely  mistook  NBC  for  God. \nDr. Ruth  Westheimer  is  a psychologist  who  has  a popular  ra-\ndio program  and  a  nightclub  act  in  which  she  informs  her  audi-\nences  about  sex  in  all  of its infinite  variety  and  in  language  once \nreserved  for  the  bedroom  and  street  corners.  She  is  almost  as \nentertaining  as  the  Reverend  Billy  Graham,  and  has  been \nquoted  as  saying,  \"I  don't  start  out  to  be  funny.  But  if  it comes \nout that  way,  I  use  it.  If they  call  me  an  entertainer,  I  say that's \ngreat.  When  a  professor  teaches  with  a  sense  of  humor,  people \nwalk  away  remembering.\"1  She  did  not  say  what  they  remem-\nber or of what  use  their  remembering  is.  But  she  has  a point:  It's \ngreat  to  be  an  entertainer.  Indeed,  in  America  God  favors  all \nthose  who  possess  both  a  talent  and  a  format  to amuse,  whether \nthey be  preachers,  athletes,  entrepreneurs,  politicians,  teachers \nor journalists.  In  America,  the  least  amusing  people  are  its  pro-\nfessional  entertainers. \nCulture  watchers  and  worriers—those  of  the  type  who  read \nbooks  like  this  one—will  know  that  the  examples  above  are  not \naberrations  but,  in  fact,  clichés.  There  is  no  shortage  of  critics \nwho  have  observed  and  recorded  the  dissolution  of  public  dis-\ncourse  in  America  and  its  conversion  into  the  arts  of show  busi-\nness. But  most  of  them,  I  believe,  have  barely  begun  to  tell  the\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to Death 6 \nstory  of  the  origin  and  meaning  of  this  descent  into  a  vast  triv-\niality.  Those  who  have  written  vigorously  on  the  matter  tell  us, \nfor example,  that  what  is  happening  is  the  residue  of  an  ex-\nhausted  capitalism;  or,  on  the  contrary,  that  it  is  the  tasteless \nfruit  of the  maturing  of  capitalism;  or  that  it  is  the  neurotic  af-\ntermath  of  the  Age  of  Freud;  or  the  retribution  of  our  allowing \nGod to  perish;  or  that  it  all comes  from  the  old  stand-bys,  greed \nand  ambition. \nI have  attended  carefully  to  these  explanations,  and  I  do not \nsay there  is  nothing  to  learn  from  them.  Marxists,  Freudians, \nLévi-Straussians,  even  Creation  Scientists  are  not  to  be  taken \nlightly.  And,  in  any  case,  I should  be  very  surprised  if  the  story  I \nhave  to  tell  is  anywhere  near  the  whole  truth.  We  are  all,  as \nHuxley  says  someplace,  Great  Abbreviators,  meaning  that  none \nof us  has  the  wit  to  know  the  whole  truth,  the  time  to  tell  it  if \nwe believed  we  did,  or  an  audience  so  gullible  as  to  accept  it. \nBut you  will  find  an  argument  here  that  presumes  a  clearer \ngrasp  of  the  matter  than  many  that  have  come  before.  Its value, \nsuch  as  it  is,  resides  in  the  directness  of  its  perspective,  which \nhas its  origins  in  observations  made  2,300  years  ago  by  Plato. It \nis an  argument  that  fixes  its  attention  on  the  forms  of  human \nconversation,  and  postulates  that  how  we  are  obliged  to  con-\nduct  such  conversations  will  have  the  strongest  possible  influ-\nence  on  what  ideas  we  can  conveniently  express.  And  what \nideas  are  convenient  to  express  inevitably  become  the  impor-\ntant  content  of  a culture. \nI use  the  word  \"conversation\"  metaphorically  to  refer  not \nonly to  speech  but  to  all  techniques  and  technologies  that  per-\nmit people  of  a particular  culture  to  exchange  messages.  In  this \nsense,  all  culture  is a conversation  or,  more  precisely,  a  corpora-\ntion  of conversations,  conducted  in  a variety  of symbolic  modes. \nOur attention  here  is  on how  forms  of public  discourse  regulate \nand even  dictate  what  kind  of  content  can  issue  from  such \nforms. \nTo take  a  simple  example  of  what  this  means,  consider  the\n\f\nThe Medium Is  the Metaphor 7 \nprimitive  technology  of  smoke  signals.  While  I  do  not  know \nexactly  what  content  was  once  carried  in  the  smoke  signals  of \nAmerican  Indians,  I  can  safely  guess  that  it  did  not  include \nphilosophical  argument.  Puffs  of  smoke  are  insufficiently  com-\nplex to  express  ideas  on  the  nature  of  existence,  and  even  if they \nwere  not,  a  Cherokee  philosopher  would  run  short  of  either \nwood  or  blankets  long  before  he reached  his  second  axiom.  You \ncannot  use  smoke  to  do  philosophy.  Its  form  excludes  the \ncontent. \nTo take  an  example  closer  to  home:  As  I suggested  earlier,  it  is \nimplausible  to  imagine  that  anyone  like  our  twenty-seventh \nPresident, the  multi-chinned,  three-hundred-pound  William \nHoward  Taft,  could  be  put  forward  as  a  presidential  candidate \nin today's  world.  The  shape  of  a man's  body  is  largely  irrelevant \nto the  shape  of  his  ideas  when  he  is  addressing  a  public  in  writ-\ning or  on  the  radio  or,  for  that  matter,  in  smoke  signals.  But  it  is \nquite  relevant  on  television.  The  grossness  of  a  three-hundred-\npound  image,  even  a  talking  one,  would  easily  overwhelm  any \nlogical or  spiritual  subtleties  conveyed  by  speech.  For  on  televi-\nsion,  discourse  is  conducted  largely  through  visual  imagery, \nwhich  is  to say  that  television  gives  us  a conversation  in  images, \nnot words.  The  emergence  of  the  image-manager  in  the  political \narena  and  the  concomitant  decline  of  the  speech  writer  attest  to \nthe fact  that  television  demands  a  different  kind  of  content  from \nother  media.  You  cannot  do  political  philosophy  on  television. \nIts form  works  against  the  content. \nTo give  still  another  example,  one  of  more  complexity:  The \ninformation,  the  content,  or,  if  you  will,  the  \"stuff\"  that  makes \nup what  is  called  \"the  news  of  the  day\"  did  not  exist—could \nnot exist—in  a  world  that  lacked  the  media  to  give  it  expres-\nsion.  I  do  not  mean  that  things  like  fires,  wars,  murders  and \nlove affairs  did not,  ever  and  always,  happen  in  places  all  over \nthe world.  I  mean  that  lacking  a  technology  to  advertise  them, \npeople  could  not  attend  to  them,  could  not  include  them  in \ntheir  daily  business.  Such  information  simply  could  not  exist  as"

    "raw_text": "Amusing Ourselves  to Death 8 \npart  of  the  content  of  culture.  This  idea—that  there  is a content \ncalled  \"the  news  of  the  day\"—was  entirely  created  by  the  tele-\ngraph  (and  since  amplified  by  newer  media),  which  made  it \npossible  to  move  decontextualized  information  over  vast  spaces \nat incredible  speed.  The  news  of  the  day  is  a  figment  of  our \ntechnological  imagination.  It  is,  quite  precisely,  a  media  event. \nWe attend  to  fragments  of  events  from  all  over  the  world  be-\ncause  we  have  multiple  media  whose  forms  are  well  suited  to \nfragmented  conversation.  Cultures  without  speed-flight  me-\ndia—let  us  say,  cultures  in  which  smoke  signals  are  the  most \nefficient  space-conquering  tool  available—do  not  have  news  of \nthe  day.  Without  a  medium  to  create  its  form,  the  news  of  the \nday does  not  exist. \nTo say  it,  then,  as  plainly  as  I can,  this  book  is  an inquiry  into \nand a  lamentation  about  the  most  significant  American  cultural \nfact of  the  second  half  of  the  twentieth  century:  the  decline  of \nthe Age  of Typography  and  the  ascendancy  of  the  Age  of Televi-\nsion.  This  change-over  has  dramatically  and  irreversibly  shifted \nthe  content  and  meaning  of  public  discourse,  since  two  media \nso vastly  different  cannot  accommodate  the  same  ideas.  As  the \ninfluence  of print  wanes,  the  content  of politics,  religion,  educa-\ntion,  and  anything  else  that  comprises  public  business  must \nchange  and  be  recast  in  terms  that  are  most  suitable  to  tele-\nvision. \nIf all  of  this  sounds  suspiciously  like  Marshall  McLuhan's \naphorism,  the  medium  is  the  message,  I  will  not  disavow  the \nassociation  (although  it  is  fashionable  to  do  so  among  respect-\nable  scholars  who,  were  it  not  for  McLuhan,  would  today  be \nmute).  I  met  McLuhan  thirty  years  ago  when  I  was  a  graduate \nstudent  and  he  an  unknown  English  professor.  I believed  then, \nas I  believe  now,  that  he  spoke  in  the  tradition  of  Orwell  and \nHuxley—that  is,  as a prophesier,  and  I  have  remained  steadfast \nto his  teaching  that  the  clearest  way  to  see  through  a  culture  is \nto attend  to  its tools  for  conversation.  I  might  add  that  my  inter-\nest in  this  point  of  view  was  first  stirred  by  a  prophet  far  more\n\f\nThe Medium Is  the Metaphor 9 \nformidable  than  McLuhan,  more  ancient  than  Plato.  In  study-\ning the  Bible  as  a  young  man,  I  found  intimations  of  the  idea \nthat  forms  of media  favor  particular  kinds  of content  and  there-\nfore  are capable  of taking  command  of  a culture.  I  refer  specifi-\ncally to  the  Decalogue,  the  Second  Commandment  of  which \nprohibits  the  Israelites  from  making  concrete  images  of  any-\nthing.  \"Thou  shalt  not  make  unto  thee  any  graven  image,  any \nlikeness  of  any  thing  that  is  in  heaven  above,  or  that  is  in  the \nearth  beneath,  or  that  is in the  water  beneath  the  earth.\"  I  won-\ndered  then,  as  so  many  others  have,  as  to  why  the  God  of  these \npeople  would  have  included  instructions  on  how  they  were  to \nsymbolize,  or  not  symbolize,  their  experience.  It  is  a  strange \ninjunction  to include  as part  of an ethical  system  unless its author \nassumed a  connection between forms of  human communication  and \nthe quality of a culture. We  may  hazard  a  guess  that  a people  who \nare being  asked  to  embrace  an  abstract,  universal  deity  would \nbe rendered  unfit  to  do  so  by  the  habit  of  drawing  pictures  or \nmaking  statues  or  depicting  their  ideas  in  any  concrete,  icono-\ngraphic  forms.  The  God  of  the  Jews  was  to  exist  in  the  Word \nand through  the  Word,  an  unprecedented  conception  requiring \nthe highest  order  of abstract  thinking.  Iconography  thus  became \nblasphemy  so  that  a  new  kind  of  God  could  enter  a  culture. \nPeople  like  ourselves  who  are  in  the  process  of converting  their \nculture  from  word-centered  to  image-centered  might  profit  by \nreflecting  on  this  Mosaic  injunction.  But  even  if  I am  wrong  in \nthese  conjectures,  it is, I believe,  a wise  and  particularly  relevant \nsupposition  that  the  media  of  communication  available  to  a cul-\nture  are  a dominant  influence  on  the  formation  of  the  culture's \nintellectual  and  social  preoccupations. \nSpeech,  of course,  is  the  primal  and  indispensable  medium.  It \nmade  us  human,  keeps  us  human,  and  in  fact  defines  what  hu-\nman  means.  This  is not  to  say  that  if there  were  no  other  means \nof communication  all  humans  would  find  it  equally  convenient \nto speak  about  the  same  things  in  the  same  way.  We  know \nenough  about  language  to  understand  that  variations  in  the\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to Death 10 \nstructures  of  languages  will  result  in  variations  in  what  may  be \ncalled  \"world  view.\"  How  people  think  about  time  and  space, \nand about  things  and  processes,  will  be  greatly  influenced  by \nthe grammatical  features  of  their  language.  We  dare  not  sup-\npose  therefore  that  all  human  minds  are  unanimous  in  under-\nstanding  how  the  world  is  put  together.  But  how  much  more \ndivergence  there  is  in  world  view  among  different  cultures  can \nbe imagined  when  we  consider  the  great  number  and  variety  of \ntools  for  conversation  that  go  beyond  speech.  For  although  cul-\nture  is  a  creation  of  speech,  it  is  recreated  anew  by  every  me-\ndium  of  communication—from  painting  to  hieroglyphs  to  the \nalphabet  to  television.  Each  medium,  like  language  itself,  makes \npossible  a  unique  mode  of  discourse  by  providing  a  new  orien-\ntation  for  thought,  for  expression,  for  sensibility.  Which,  of \ncourse,  is  what  McLuhan  meant  in  saying  the  medium  is  the \nmessage.  His  aphorism,  however,  is  in need  of  amendment  be-\ncause,  as  it  stands,  it  may  lead  one  to  confuse  a message  with  a \nmetaphor.  A  message  denotes  a  specific,  concrete  statement \nabout  the  world.  But  the  forms  of  our  media,  including  the \nsymbols  through  which  they  permit  conversation,  do  not  make \nsuch  statements.  They  are  rather  like  metaphors,  working  by \nunobtrusive  but  powerful  implication  to  enforce  their  special \ndefinitions  of  reality.  Whether  we  are  experiencing  the  world \nthrough  the  lens  of speech  or  the  printed  word  or  the  television \ncamera,  our  media-metaphors  classify  the  world  for  us,  se-\nquence  it,  frame  it, enlarge  it,  reduce  it,  color  it, argue  a case  for \nwhat  the  world  is  like.  As  Ernst  Cassirer  remarked: \nPhysical reality seems  to recede in proportion  as  man's  symbolic \nactivity advances.  Instead  of  dealing with  the  things  themselves \nman is  in a  sense constantly  conversing  with  himself. He has so \nenveloped himself in linguistic forms, in artistic images, in mythi-\ncal symbols or religious rites that he cannot see or know anything \nexcept by the interposition  of [an] artificial medium.2\n\f\nThe Medium Is  the Metaphor 11 \nWhat  is  peculiar  about  such  interpositions  of  media  is  that \ntheir  role  in  directing  what  we  will  see  or  know  is  so  rarely \nnoticed.  A  person  who  reads  a  book  or  who  watches  television \nor who  glances  at  his  watch  is  not  usually  interested  in  how  his \nmind  is  organized  and  controlled  by  these  events,  still  less  in \nwhat  idea  of  the  world  is  suggested  by  a  book,  television,  or  a \nwatch.  But  there  are  men  and  women  who  have  noticed  these \nthings,  especially  in  our  own  times.  Lewis  Mumford,  for  exam-\nple, has  been  one  of  our  great  noticers.  He  is  not  the  sort  of  a \nman  who  looks  at  a clock  merely  to  see  what  time  it is. Not  that \nhe lacks  interest  in  the  content  of  clocks,  which  is  of concern  to \neveryone  from  moment  to  moment,  but  he  is  far  more  inter-\nested in  how  a  clock  creates  the  idea  of  \"moment  to  moment.\" \nHe attends  to  the  philosophy  of  clocks,  to  clocks  as  metaphor, \nabout  which  our  education  has  had  little  to  say  and  clock \nmakers  nothing  at  all.  \"The  clock,\"  Mumford  has  concluded, \n\"is a piece  of power  machinery  whose  'product'  is  seconds  and \nminutes.\"  In  manufacturing  such  a  product,  the  clock  has  the \neffect  of disassociating  time  from  human  events  and  thus  nour-\nishes the  belief  in  an  independent  world  of  mathematically \nmeasurable  sequences.  Moment  to  moment,  it  turns  out,  is  not \nGod's  conception,  or  nature's.  It  is man  conversing  with  himself \nabout  and  through  a  piece  of machinery  he  created. \nIn Mumford's  great  book  Technics  and Civilization,  he  shows \nhow,  beginning  in  the  fourteenth  century,  the  clock  made  us \ninto  time-keepers,  and  then  time-savers,  and  now  time-servers. \nIn the  process,  we  have  learned  irreverence  toward  the  sun  and \nthe seasons,  for  in a world  made  up  of seconds  and  minutes,  the \nauthority  of  nature  is  superseded.  Indeed,  as  Mumford  points \nout,  with  the  invention  of  the  clock,  Eternity  ceased  to  serve  as \nthe measure  and  focus  of human  events.  And  thus,  though  few \nwould  have  imagined  the  connection,  the  inexorable  ticking  of \nthe clock  may  have  had  more  to  do  with  the  weakening  of \nGod's  supremacy  than  all  the  treatises  produced  by  the  phi-\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to Death 12 \nlosophers  of  the  Enlightenment;  that  is  to  say,  the  clock  intro-\nduced  a  new  form  of  conversation  between  man  and  God,  in \nwhich  God  appears  to  have  been  the  loser.  Perhaps  Moses \nshould  have  included  another  Commandment:  Thou  shalt  not \nmake  mechanical  representations  of  time. \nThat  the  alphabet  introduced  a  new  form  of conversation  be-\ntween  man  and  man  is  by  now  a  commonplace  among  schol-\nars.  To  be  able  to  see  one's  utterances  rather  than  only  to  hear \nthem  is  no  small  matter,  though  our  education,  once  again,  has \nhad  little  to  say  about  this.  Nonetheless,  it  is clear  that  phonetic \nwriting  created  a  new  conception  of  knowledge,  as  well  as  a \nnew  sense  of  intelligence,  of  audience  and  of  posterity,  all  of \nwhich  Plato recognized  at  an  early  stage  in  the  development  of \ntexts.  \"No  man  of  intelligence,\"  he  wrote  in  his  Seventh  Letter, \n\"will  venture  to  express  his  philosophical  views  in  language, \nespecially  not  in  language  that  is  unchangeable,  which  is  true  of \nthat  which  is  set  down  in  written  characters.\"  This  notwith-\nstanding,  he  wrote  voluminously  and  understood  better  than \nanyone  else  that  the  setting  down  of  views  in  written  characters \nwould  be  the  beginning  of  philosophy,  not  its  end.  Philosophy \ncannot  exist  without  criticism,  and  writing  makes  it  possible \nand  convenient  to  subject  thought  to  a continuous  and  concen-\ntrated  scrutiny.  Writing  freezes  speech  and  in  so  doing  gives \nbirth  to  the  grammarian,  the  logician,  the  rhetorician,  the  histo-\nrian, the  scientist—all  those  who  must  hold  language  before \nthem  so  that  they  can  see  what  it  means,  where  it  errs,  and \nwhere  it  is  leading. \nPlato knew  all  of this,  which  means  that  he  knew  that  writing \nwould  bring  about  a  perceptual  revolution:  a  shift  from  the  ear \nto the  eye  as  an  organ  of  language  processing.  Indeed,  there  is a \nlegend  that  to  encourage  such  a  shift  Plato insisted  that  his  stu-\ndents  study  geometry  before  entering  his  Academy.  If  true,  it \nwas  a  sound  idea,  for  as  the  great  literary  critic  Northrop  Frye \nhas  remarked,  \"the  written  word  is  far  more  powerful  than  sim-\nply a  reminder:  it  re-creates  the  past  in  the  present,  and  gives\n\f\nThe Medium Is  the Metaphor 13 \nus, not  the  familiar  remembered  thing,  but  the  glittering  inten-\nsity of the  summoned-up  hallucination.\"3 \nAll that  Plato surmised  about  the  consequences  of  writing  is \nnow  well  understood  by  anthropologists,  especially  those  who \nhave  studied  cultures  in  which  speech  is  the  only  source  of \ncomplex  conversation.  Anthropologists  know  that  the  written \nword,  as  Northrop  Frye  meant  to  suggest,  is not  merely  an  echo \nof a  speaking  voice.  It  is  another  kind  of  voice  altogether,  a \nconjurer's  trick  of  the  first  order.  It  must  certainly  have  ap-\npeared  that  way  to  those  who  invented  it,  and  that  is  why  we \nshould  not  be  surprised  that  the  Egyptian  god  Thoth,  who  is \nalleged  to  have  brought  writing  to  the  King  Thamus,  was  also \nthe god  of  magic.  People like  ourselves  may  see  nothing  won-\ndrous  in  writing,  but  our  anthropologists  know  how  strange \nand magical  it  appears  to  a  purely  oral  people—a  conversation \nwith  no  one  and  yet  with  everyone.  What  could  be  stranger \nthan  the  silence  one  encounters  when  addressing  a  question  to \na text?  What  could  be  more  metaphysically  puzzling  than  ad-\ndressing  an  unseen  audience,  as  every  writer  of books  must  do? \nAnd correcting  oneself  because  one  knows  that  an  unknown \nreader  will  disapprove  or  misunderstand? \nI bring  all  of  this  up  because  what  my  book  is  about  is  how \nour own  tribe  is  undergoing  a  vast  and  trembling  shift  from  the \nmagic  of  writing  to  the  magic  of  electronics.  What  I  mean  to \npoint  out  here  is  that  the  introduction  into  a  culture  of  a  tech-\nnique  such  as  writing  or  a  clock  is  not  merely  an  extension  of \nman's  power  to  bind  time  but  a  transformation  of  his  way  of \nthinking—and,  of  course,  of the  content  of his  culture.  And  that \nis what  I  mean  to  say  by  calling  a  medium  a  metaphor.  We  are \ntold in  school,  quite  correctly,  that  a  metaphor  suggests  what  a \nthing  is  like  by  comparing  it  to  something  else.  And  by  the \npower  of  its  suggestion,  it  so  fixes  a  conception  in  our  minds \nthat  we  cannot  imagine  the  one  thing  without  the  other:  Light \nis a wave;  language,  a  tree;  God,  a wise  and  venerable  man;  the \nmind,  a  dark  cavern  illuminated  by  knowledge.  And  if  these"

    "raw_text": "Amusing Ourselves  to Death 14 \nmetaphors  no  longer  serve  us,  we  must,  in  the  nature  of  the \nmatter,  find  others  that  will.  Light  is  a  particle;  language,  a \nriver;  God  (as  Bertrand  Russell  proclaimed),  a  differential  equa-\ntion;  the  mind,  a  garden  that  yearns  to  be  cultivated. \nBut our  media-metaphors  are  not  so  explicit  or  so  vivid  as \nthese,  and  they  are  far  more  complex.  In  understanding  their \nmetaphorical  function,  we  must  take  into  account  the  symbolic \nforms  of their  information,  the  source  of  their  information,  the \nquantity  and  speed  of  their  information,  the  context  in  which \ntheir  information  is  experienced.  Thus,  it  takes  some  digging  to \nget at  them,  to  grasp,  for  example,  that  a  clock  recreates  time  as \nan independent,  mathematically  precise  sequence;  that  writing \nrecreates  the  mind  as  a  tablet  on  which  experience  is  written; \nthat  the  telegraph  recreates  news  as  a  commodity.  And  yet, \nsuch  digging  becomes  easier  if  we  start  from  the  assumption \nthat  in  every  tool  we  create,  an  idea  is  embedded  that  goes  be-\nyond  the  function  of the  thing  itself.  It has  been  pointed  out,  for \nexample,  that  the  invention  of  eyeglasses  in  the  twelfth  century \nnot only  made  it  possible  to  improve  defective  vision  but  sug-\ngested  the  idea  that  human  beings  need  not  accept  as  final \neither  the  endowments  of  nature  or  the  ravages  of  time.  Eye-\nglasses  refuted  the  belief  that  anatomy  is  destiny  by  putting \nforward  the  idea  that  our  bodies  as  well  as  our  minds  are  im-\nprovable.  I  do not  think  it  goes  too  far  to say  that  there  is  a link \nbetween  the  invention  of  eyeglasses  in  the  twelfth  century  and \ngene-splitting  research  in  the  twentieth. \nEven such  an  instrument  as  the  microscope,  hardly  a  tool  of \neveryday  use,  had  embedded  within  it  a quite  astonishing  idea, \nnot about  biology  but  about  psychology.  By  revealing  a  world \nhitherto  hidden  from  view,  the  microscope  suggested  a  possibil-\nity about  the  structure  of  the  mind. \nIf things  are  not  what  they  seem,  if microbes  lurk,  unseen,  on \nand under  our  skin,  if the  invisible  controls  the  visible,  then  is  it \nnot possible  that  ids  and  egos  and  superegos  also  lurk  some-\nwhere  unseen?  What  else  is psychoanalysis  but  a  microscope  of\n\f\nThe Medium Is  the Metaphor 15 \nthe mind?  Where  do  our  notions  of mind  come  from  if not  from \nmetaphors  generated  by  our  tools?  What  does  it  mean  to  say \nthat  someone  has  an  IQ  of 126?  There  are  no  numbers  in  peo-\nple's  heads.  Intelligence  does  not  have  quantity  or  magnitude, \nexcept  as  we  believe  that  it  does.  And  why  do  we  believe  that  it \ndoes?  Because  we  have  tools  that  imply  that  this  is  what  the \nmind  is  like.  Indeed,  our  tools  for  thought  suggest  to  us  what \nour bodies  are  like,  as  when  someone  refers  to  her  \"biological \nclock,\"  or  when  we  talk  of  our  \"genetic  codes,\"  or  when  we \nread someone's  face  like a book,  or  when  our  facial  expressions \ntelegraph  our  intentions. \nWhen  Galileo  remarked  that  the  language  of nature  is  written \nin mathematics,  he  meant  it  only  as  a  metaphor.  Nature  itself \ndoes not  speak.  Neither  do  our  minds  or  our  bodies  or,  more  to \nthe point  of  this  book,  our  bodies  politic.  Our  conversations \nabout  nature  and  about  ourselves  are  conducted  in  whatever \n\"languages\"  we  find  it  possible  and  convenient  to  employ.  We \ndo not  see  nature  or  intelligence  or  human  motivation  or  ideol-\nogy as  \"it\"  is  but  only  as  our  languages  are.  And  our  languages \nare our  media.  Our  media  are  our  metaphors.  Our  metaphors \ncreate  the  content  of  our  culture."

    "raw_text": "2. \nMedia as Epistemology \nIt is  my  intention  in  this  book  to  show  that  a  great  media-\nmetaphor  shift  has  taken  place  in  America,  with  the  result  that \nthe content  of  much  of  our  public  discourse  has  become  dan-\ngerous  nonsense.  With  this  in  view,  my  task  in  the  chapters \nahead  is  straightforward.  I  must,  first,  demonstrate  how,  under \nthe governance  of  the  printing  press,  discourse  in  America  was \ndifferent  from  what  it  is  now—generally  coherent,  serious  and \nrational;  and  then  how,  under  the  governance  of  television,  it \nhas become  shriveled  and  absurd.  But  to  avoid  the  possibility \nthat  my  analysis  will  be interpreted  as  standard-brand  academic \nwhimpering,  a  kind  of  elitist  complaint  against  \"junk\"  on  tele-\nvision,  I must  first explain  that  my  focus  is on epistemology,  not \non aesthetics  or  literary  criticism.  Indeed,  I  appreciate  junk  as \nmuch  as  the  next  fellow,  and  I  know  full  well  that  the  printing \npress  has  generated  enough  of  it  to  fill  the  Grand  Canyon  to \noverflowing.  Television  is  not  old  enough  to  have  matched \nprinting's  output  of  junk. \nAnd so,  I  raise  no  objection  to  television's  junk.  The  best \nthings  on  television  are  its junk,  and  no  one  and  nothing  is seri-\nously  threatened  by  it.  Besides,  we  do  not  measure  a  culture  by \nits output  of  undisguised  trivialities  but  by  what  it  claims  as \nsignificant.  Therein  is  our  problem,  for  television  is  at  its  most \ntrivial  and,  therefore,  most  dangerous  when  its  aspirations  are \nhigh,  when  it  presents  itself  as  a  carrier  of  important  cultural \nconversations.  The  irony  here  is  that  this  is  what  intellectuals \nand critics  are  constantly  urging  television  to  do.  The  trouble \n16\n\f\nMedia as  Epistemology 17 \nwith  such  people  is  that  they  do  not  take  television  seriously \nenough.  For,  like  the  printing  press,  television  is  nothing  less \nthan  a  philosophy  of  rhetoric.  To talk  seriously  about  television, \none must  therefore  talk  of  epistemology.  All  other  commentary \nis in itself  trivial. \nEpistemology  is  a  complex  and  usually  opaque  subject  con-\ncerned  with  the  origins  and  nature  of knowledge.  The  part  of its \nsubject  matter  that  is  relevant  here  is  the  interest  it  takes  in \ndefinitions  of truth  and  the  sources  from  which  such  definitions \ncome.  In  particular,  I  want  to  show  that  definitions  of truth  are \nderived,  at  least  in  part,  from  the  character  of the  media  of  com-\nmunication  through  which  information  is  conveyed.  I  want  to \ndiscuss  how  media  are  implicated  in  our  epistemologies. \nIn the  hope  of  simplifying  what  I  mean  by  the  title  of  this \nchapter,  media  as  epistemology,  I  find  it  helpful  to  borrow  a \nword  from  Northrop  Frye,  who  has  made  use  of  a  principle  he \ncalls resonance.  \"Through  resonance,\"  he  writes,  \"a  particular \nstatement  in  a  particular  context  acquires  a  universal  signifi-\ncance.\"1  Frye  offers  as  an  opening  example  the  phrase  \"the \ngrapes  of wrath,\"  which  first  appears  in  Isaiah  in  the  context  of \na celebration  of  a  prospective  massacre  of  Edomites.  But  the \nphrase,  Frye  continues,  \"has  long  ago  flown  away  from  this \ncontext  into  many  new  contexts,  contexts  that  give  dignity  to \nthe human  situation  instead  of  merely  reflecting  its bigotries.\"2 \nHaving  said  this,  Frye  extends  the  idea  of  resonance  so  that  it \ngoes beyond  phrases  and  sentences.  A  character  in  a  play  or \nstory—Hamlet,  for  example,  or  Lewis  Carroll's  Alice—may \nhave  resonance.  Objects  may  have  resonance,  and  so  may \ncountries:  \"The  smallest  details  of  the  geography  of  two  tiny \nchopped-up  countries,  Greece  and  Israel,  have  imposed  them-\nselves on  our  consciousness  until  they  have  become  part  of  the \nmap  of our  own  imaginative  world,  whether  we  have  ever  seen \nthese  countries  or  not.\"3 \nIn addressing  the  question  of  the  source  of  resonance,  Frye \nconcludes  that  metaphor  is  the  generative  force—that  is,  the\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to Death 18 \npower  of  a phrase,  a  book,  a  character,  or  a history  to  unify  and \ninvest  with  meaning  a  variety  of  attitudes  or  experiences.  Thus, \nAthens  becomes  a  metaphor  of  intellectual  excellence,  wher-\never we  find  it;  Hamlet,  a  metaphor  of  brooding  indecisiveness; \nAlice's  wanderings,  a  metaphor  of  a search  for  order  in  a world \nof semantic  nonsense. \nI now  depart  from  Frye  (who,  I  am  certain,  would  raise  no \nobjection)  but  I  take  his  word  along  with  me.  Every  medium  of \ncommunication,  I  am claiming,  has  resonance,  for  resonance  is \nmetaphor  writ  large.  Whatever  the  original  and  limited  context \nof its  use  may  have  been,  a  medium  has  the  power  to  fly  far \nbeyond  that  context  into  new  and  unexpected  ones.  Because  of \nthe way  it  directs  us  to  organize  our  minds  and  integrate  our \nexperience  of  the  world,  it  imposes  itself  on  our  consciousness \nand social  institutions  in  myriad  forms.  It  sometimes  has  the \npower  to  become  implicated  in  our  concepts  of  piety,  or  good-\nness,  or  beauty.  And  it  is  always  implicated  in  the  ways  we \ndefine  and  regulate  our  ideas  of truth. \nTo explain  how  this  happens—how  the  bias  of a medium  sits \nheavy,  felt  but  unseen,  over  a  culture—I  offer  three  cases  of \ntruth-telling. \nThe first  is  drawn  from  a  tribe  in  western  Africa  that  has  no \nwriting  system  but  whose  rich  oral  tradition  has  given  form  to \nits ideas  of  civil  law.4  When  a  dispute  arises,  the  complainants \ncome  before  the  chief  of  the  tribe  and  state  their  grievances. \nWith  no  written  law  to  guide  him,  the  task  of  the  chief  is  to \nsearch  through  his  vast  repertoire  of  proverbs  and  sayings  to \nfind one  that  suits  the  situation  and  is  equally  satisfying  to both \ncomplainants.  That  accomplished,  all  parties  are  agreed  that \njustice  has  been  done,  that  the  truth  has  been  served.  You  will \nrecognize,  of  course,  that  this  was  largely  the  method  of  Jesus \nand other  Biblical  figures  who,  living  in  an  essentially  oral  cul-\nture,  drew  upon  all  of  the  resources  of  speech,  including  mne-\nmonic  devices,  formulaic  expressions  and  parables,  as  a means \nof discovering  and  revealing  truth.  As  Walter  Ong  points  out,  in\n\f\nMedia as  Epistemology 19 \noral cultures  proverbs  and  sayings  are  not  occasional  devices: \n\"They  are  incessant.  They  form  the  substance  of  thought  itself. \nThought  in  any  extended  form  is impossible  without  them,  for  it \nconsists  in  them.\"5 \nTo people  like  ourselves  any  reliance  on  proverbs  and  sayings \nis reserved  largely  for  resolving  disputes  among  or  with  chil-\ndren.  \"Possession  is  nine-tenths  of  the  law.\"  \"First  come,  first \nserved.\"  \"Haste  makes  waste.\"  These  are  forms  of  speech  we \npull out  in  small  crises  with  our  young  but  would  think  ridicu-\nlous to  produce  in  a  courtroom  where  \"serious\"  matters  are  to \nbe decided.  Can  you  imagine  a  bailiff  asking  a  jury  if  it  has \nreached  a  decision  and  receiving  the  reply  that  \"to  err  is human \nbut to  forgive  is  divine\"?  Or  even  better,  \"Let  us  render  unto \nCaesar  that  which  is  Caesar's  and  to  God  that  which  is  God's\"? \nFor the  briefest  moment,  the  judge  might  be  charmed  but  if  a \n\"serious\"  language  form  is  not  immediately  forthcoming,  the \njury  may  end  up  with  a  longer  sentence  than  most  guilty  de-\nfendants. \nJudges,  lawyers  and  defendants  do  not  regard  proverbs  or \nsayings  as a relevant  response  to  legal  disputes.  In  this,  they  are \nseparated  from  the  tribal  chief  by  a  media-metaphor.  For  in  a \nprint-based  courtroom,  where  law  books,  briefs,  citations  and \nother  written  materials  define  and  organize  the  method  of  find-\ning the  truth,  the  oral  tradition  has  lost  much  of  its resonance— \nbut not  all  of it. Testimony  is  expected  to  be  given  orally,  on  the \nassumption  that  the  spoken,  not  the  written,  word  is  a  truer \nreflection  of  the  state  of  mind  of  a  witness.  Indeed,  in  many \ncourtrooms  jurors  are  not  permitted  to  take  notes,  nor  are  they \ngiven  written  copies  of  the  judge's  explanation  of  the  law. \nJurors  are  expected  to  hear the  truth,  or  its  opposite,  not  to  read \nit. Thus,  we  may  say  that  there  is  a clash  of  resonances  in  our \nconcept  of legal  truth.  On  the  one  hand,  there  is a residual  belief \nin the  power  of speech,  and  speech  alone,  to  carry  the  truth;  on \nthe other  hand,  there  is  a  much  stronger  belief  in  the  authen-\nticity of  writing  and,  in  particular,  printing.  This  second  belief\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to Death 20 \nhas little  tolerance  for  poetry,  proverbs,  sayings,  parables  or  any \nother  expressions  of  oral  wisdom.  The  law  is  what  legislators \nand judges  have  written.  In  our  culture,  lawyers  do  not  have  to \nbe wise;  they  need  to  be  well  briefed. \nA similar  paradox  exists  in  universities,  and  with  roughly  the \nsame  distribution  of  resonances;  that  is  to  say,  there  are  a  few \nresidual  traditions  based  on  the  notion  that  speech  is  the  pri-\nmary  carrier  of  truth.  But  for  the  most  part,  university  concep-\ntions  of  truth  are  tightly  bound  to  the  structure  and  logic  of the \nprinted  word.  To exemplify  this  point,  I draw  here  on a personal \nexperience  that  occurred  during  a  still  widely  practiced  medi-\neval ritual  known  as  a  \"doctoral  oral.\"  I  use  the  word  medieval \nliterally,  for  in the  Middle  Ages  students  were  always  examined \norally,  and  the  tradition  is  carried  forward  in  the  assumption \nthat  a  candidate  must  be  able  to  talk  competently  about  his \nwritten  work.  But,  of  course,  the  written  work  matters  most. \nIn the  case  I  have  in  mind,  the  issue  of  what  is  a  legitimate \nform  of  truth-telling  was  raised  to  a  level  of  consciousness \nrarely  achieved.  The  candidate  had  included  in  his  thesis  a foot-\nnote,  intended  as  documentation  of  a  quotation,  which  read: \n\"Told  to  the  investigator  at  the  Roosevelt  Hotel  on  January  18, \n1981,  in  the  presence  of  Arthur  Lingeman  and  Jerrold  Gross.\" \nThis citation  drew  the  attention  of  no  fewer  than  four  of the  five \noral  examiners,  all  of whom  observed  that  it was  hardly  suitable \nas a form  of documentation  and  that  it ought  to  be replaced  by  a \ncitation  from  a  book  or  article.  \"You  are  not  a  journalist,\"  one \nprofessor  remarked.  \"You  are  supposed  to  be  a  scholar.\"  Per-\nhaps  because  the  candidate  knew  of  no  published  statement  of \nwhat  he  was  told  at  the  Roosevelt  Hotel,  he  defended  himself \nvigorously  on  the  grounds  that  there  were  witnesses  to  what  he \nwas told,  that  they  were  available  to  attest  to  the  accuracy  of the \nquotation,  and  that  the  form  in  which  an  idea  is  conveyed  is \nirrelevant  to  its  truth.  Carried  away  on  the  wings  of  his  elo-\nquence,  the  candidate  argued  further  that  there  were  more  than \nthree  hundred  references  to  published  works  in  his  thesis  and\n\f\nMedia as Epistemology 21 \nthat  it  was  extremely  unlikely  that  any  of  them  would  be \nchecked  for  accuracy  by  the  examiners,  by  which  he  meant  to \nraise the  question,  Why  do  you  assume  the  accuracy  of  a  print-\nreferenced  citation  but  not  a  speech-referenced  one? \nThe answer  he  received  took  the  following  line:  You  are  mis-\ntaken  in  believing  that  the  form  in  which  an  idea  is  conveyed  is \nirrelevant  to  its  truth.  In  the  academic  world,  the  published \nword  is  invested  with  greater  prestige  and  authenticity  than  the \nspoken  word.  What  people  say  is  assumed  to  be  more  casually \nuttered  than  what  they  write.  The  written  word  is  assumed  to \nhave  been  reflected  upon  and  revised  by  its author,  reviewed  by \nauthorities  and  editors.  It  is  easier  to  verify  or  refute,  and  it  is \ninvested  with  an  impersonal  and  objective  character,  which  is \nwhy,  no  doubt,  you  have  referred  to  yourself  in  your  thesis  as \n\"the  investigator\"  and  not  by  your  name;  that  is  to  say,  the \nwritten  word  is,  by  its  nature,  addressed  to  the  world,  not  an \nindividual.  The  written  word  endures,  the  spoken  word  dis-\nappears;  and  that  is  why  writing  is  closer  to  the  truth  than \nspeaking.  Moreover,  we  are  sure  you  would  prefer  that  this \ncommission  produce  a  written  statement  that  you  have  passed \nyour  examination  (should  you  do  so)  than  for  us  merely  to  tell \nyou that  you  have,  and  leave  it  at  that.  Our  written  statement \nwould  represent  the  \"truth.\"  Our  oral  agreement  would  be  only \na rumor. \nThe candidate  wisely  said  no  more  on  the  matter  except  to \nindicate  that  he  would  make  whatever  changes  the  commission \nsuggested  and  that  he  profoundly  wished  that  should  he  pass \nthe \"oral,\"  a  written  document  would  attest  to  that  fact.  He did \npass, and  in  time  the  proper  words  were  written. \nA third  example  of  the  influence  of media  on  our  epistemol-\nogies can  be  drawn  from  the  trial  of  the  great  Socrates.  At  the \nopening  of  Socrates'  defense,  addressing  a  jury  of  five  hundred, \nhe apologizes  for  not having  a well-prepared  speech.  He  tells  his \nAthenian  brothers  that  he  will  falter,  begs  that  they  not  inter-\nrupt  him  on  that  account,  asks  that  they  regard  him  as  they\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to Death 22 \nwould  a  stranger  from  another  city,  and  promises  that  he  will \ntell them  the  truth,  without  adornment  or  eloquence.  Begin-\nning  this  way  was,  of  course,  characteristic  of  Socrates,  but  it \nwas not  characteristic  of  the  age  in  which  he  lived.  For,  as  Soc-\nrates  knew  full  well,  his  Athenian  brothers  did  not  regard  the \nprinciples  of  rhetoric  and  the  expression  of  truth  to  be indepen-\ndent  of  each  other.  People  like  ourselves  find  great  appeal  in \nSocrates'  plea  because  we  are  accustomed  to  thinking  of  rheto-\nric as  an  ornament  of  speech—most  often  pretentious,  super-\nficial and  unnecessary.  But  to  the  people  who  invented  it,  the \nSophists  of  fifth-century  B.C.  Greece  and  their  heirs,  rhetoric \nwas not  merely  an  opportunity  for  dramatic  performance  but  a \nnear  indispensable  means  of  organizing  evidence  and  proofs, \nand  therefore  of communicating  truth.6 \nIt was  not  only  a  key  element  in  the  education  of  Athenians \n(far more  important  than  philosophy)  but  a  preeminent  art \nform.  To  the  Greeks,  rhetoric  was  a  form  of  spoken  writing. \nThough  it  always  implied  oral  performance,  its  power  to  reveal \nthe truth  resided  in  the  written  word's  power  to  display  argu-\nments  in  orderly  progression.  Although  Plato himself  disputed \nthis conception  of  truth  (as  we might  guess  from  Socrates'  plea), \nhis contemporaries  believed  that  rhetoric  was  the  proper  means \nthrough  which  \"right  opinion\"  was  to  be  both  discovered  and \narticulated.  To  disdain  rhetorical  rules,  to  speak  one's  thoughts \nin a  random  manner,  without  proper  emphasis  or  appropriate \npassion,  was  considered  demeaning  to  the  audience's  intelli-\ngence  and  suggestive  of  falsehood.  Thus,  we  can  assume  that \nmany  of  the  280  jurors  who  cast  a guilty  ballot  against  Socrates \ndid so  because  his  manner  was  not  consistent  with  truthful  mat-\nter, as  they  understood  the  connection. \nThe point  I  am  leading  to  by this  and  the  previous  examples  is \nthat  the  concept  of  truth  is  intimately  linked  to  the  biases  of \nforms  of  expression.  Truth  does  not,  and  never  has,  come  un-\nadorned.  It  must  appear  in  its  proper  clothing  or  it  is  not  ac-\nknowledged,  which  is  a way  of  saying  that  the  \"truth\"  is  a kind\n\f\nMedia as  Epistemology 23 \nof cultural  prejudice.  Each  culture  conceives  of  it as  being  most \nauthentically  expressed  in  certain  symbolic  forms  that  another \nculture  may  regard  as  trivial  or  irrelevant.  Indeed,  to  the  Greeks \nof Aristotle's  time,  and  for  two  thousand  years  afterward,  scien-\ntific truth  was  best  discovered  and  expressed  by  deducing  the \nnature  of  things  from  a  set  of  self-evident  premises,  which  ac-\ncounts  for  Aristotle's  believing  that  women  have  fewer  teeth \nthan  men,  and  that  babies  are  healthier  if  conceived  when  the \nwind  is  in  the  north.  Aristotle  was  twice  married  but  so  far  as \nwe know,  it  did  not  occur  to  him  to  ask  either  of  his  wives  if he \ncould  count  her  teeth.  And  as  for  his  obstetric  opinions,  we  are \nsafe in assuming  he  used  no  questionnaires  and  hid  behind  no \ncurtains.  Such  acts  would  have  seemed  to  him  both  vulgar  and \nunnecessary,  for  that  was  not  the  way  to  ascertain  the  truth  of \nthings.  The  language  of  deductive  logic  provided  a  surer  road. \nWe must  not  be  too  hasty  in  mocking  Aristotle's  prejudices. \nWe have  enough  of  our  own,  as  for  example,  the  equation  we \nmoderns  make  of  truth  and  quantification.  In  this  prejudice,  we \ncome  astonishingly  close  to  the  mystical  beliefs  of  Pythagoras \nand his  followers  who  attempted  to  submit  all  of life  to the  sov-\nereignty  of  numbers.  Many  of  our  psychologists,  sociologists, \neconomists  and  other  latter-day  cabalists  will  have  numbers  to \ntell them  the  truth  or  they  will  have  nothing.  Can  you  imagine, \nfor example,  a  modern  economist  articulating  truths  about  our \nstandard  of  living  by  reciting  a  poem?  Or  by  telling  what  hap-\npened  to  him  during  a  late-night  walk  through  East  St.  Louis? \nOr by offering  a series  of proverbs  and  parables,  beginning  with \nthe saying  about  a  rich  man,  a  camel,  and  the  eye  of  a  needle? \nThe first  would  be  regarded  as  irrelevant,  the  second  merely \nanecdotal,  the  last  childish.  Yet  these  forms  of language  are  cer-\ntainly  capable  of  expressing  truths  about  economic  relation-\nships,  as  well  as  any  other  relationships,  and  indeed  have  been \nemployed  by  various  peoples.  But  to  the  modern  mind,  resonat-\ning with  different  media-metaphors,  the  truth  in  economics  is \nbelieved  to  be  best  discovered  and  expressed  in  numbers.  Per-\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to Death 24 \nhaps  it is. I will  not  argue  the  point.  I mean  only  to  call attention \nto the  fact  that  there  is  a certain  measure  of  arbitrariness  in  the \nforms  that  truth-telling  may  take.  We  must  remember  that  Gali-\nleo merely  said  that  the  language  of  nature is  written  in  mathe-\nmatics.  He  did  not  say  everything  is.  And  even  the  truth  about \nnature  need  not  be  expressed  in  mathematics.  For  most  of  hu-\nman  history,  the  language  of  nature  has  been  the  language  of \nmyth  and  ritual.  These  forms,  one  might  add,  had  the  virtues  of \nleaving  nature  unthreatened  and  of  encouraging  the  belief  that \nhuman  beings  are  part  of  it.  It hardly  befits  a people  who  stand \nready  to  blow  up  the  planet  to  praise  themselves  too  vigorously \nfor having  found  the  true  way  to  talk  about  nature. \nIn saying  this,  I  am  not  making  a  case  for  epistemological \nrelativism.  Some  ways  of  truth-telling  are  better  than  others, \nand therefore  have  a  healthier  influence  on  the  cultures  that \nadopt  them.  Indeed,  I  hope  to  persuade  you  that  the  decline \nof a  print-based  epistemology  and  the  accompanying  rise  of  a \ntelevision-based  epistemology  has  had  grave  consequences  for \npublic  life,  that  we  are  getting  sillier  by the  minute.  And  that  is \nwhy  it  is  necessary  for  me  to  drive  hard  the  point  that  the \nweight  assigned  to  any  form  of truth-telling  is  a function  of the \ninfluence  of media  of  communication.  \"Seeing  is believing\"  has \nalways  had  a  preeminent  status  as  an  epistemological  axiom, \nbut \"saying  is  believing,\"  \"reading  is  believing,\"  \"counting  is \nbelieving,\"  \"deducing  is  believing,\"  and  \"feeling  is  believing\" \nare others  that  have  risen  or  fallen  in  importance  as  cultures \nhave  undergone  media  change.  As  a culture  moves  from  orality \nto writing  to  printing  to  televising,  its  ideas  of  truth  move \nwith  it.  Every  philosophy  is  the  philosophy  of  a  stage  of  life, \nNietzsche  remarked.  To  which  we  might  add  that  every  epis-\ntemology  is  the  epistemology  of  a stage  of media  development. \nTruth,  like  time  itself,  is  a  product  of  a  conversation  man  has \nwith  himself  about  and  through  the  techniques  of  communica-\ntion  he  has  invented. \nSince intelligence  is  primarily  defined  as  one's  capacity  to\n\f\nMedia as  Epistemology 25 \ngrasp  the  truth  of things,  it follows  that  what  a  culture  means  by \nintelligence  is  derived  from  the  character  of  its  important  forms \nof communication.  In  a purely  oral  culture,  intelligence  is  often \nassociated  with  aphoristic  ingenuity,  that  is, the  power  to  invent \ncompact  sayings  of  wide  applicability.  The  wise  Solomon,  we \nare told  in  First  Kings,  knew  three  thousand  proverbs.  In  a print \nculture,  people  with  such  a  talent  are  thought  to  be  quaint  at \nbest, more  likely  pompous  bores.  In a purely  oral  culture,  a high \nvalue  is  always  placed  on  the  power  to  memorize,  for  where \nthere  are  no  written  words,  the  human  mind  must  function  as a \nmobile  library.  To forget  how  something  is  to be  said  or  done  is \na danger  to  the  community  and  a  gross  form  of  stupidity.  In  a \nprint  culture,  the  memorization  of  a  poem,  a  menu,  a  law  or \nmost  anything  else  is merely  charming.  It  is almost  always  func-\ntionally  irrelevant  and  certainly  not  considered  a  sign  of  high \nintelligence. \nAlthough  the  general  character  of print-intelligence  would  be \nknown  to  anyone  who  would  be  reading  this  book,  you  may \narrive  at  a  reasonably  detailed  definition  of it by simply  consid-\nering  what  is  demanded  of  you  as  you read  this  book.  You  are \nrequired,  first of all, to  remain  more  or  less  immobile  for  a fairly \nlong time.  If  you  cannot  do  this  (with  this  or  any  other  book), \nour culture  may  label  you  as  anything  from  hyperkinetic  to  un-\ndisciplined;  in  any  case,  as  suffering  from  some  sort  of  intel-\nlectual  deficiency.  The  printing  press  makes  rather  stringent \ndemands  on  our  bodies  as  well  as  our  minds.  Controlling  your \nbody is,  however,  only  a  minimal  requirement.  You  must  also \nhave  learned  to  pay  no  attention  to  the  shapes  of  the  letters  on \nthe page.  You  must  see  through  them,  so  to  speak,  so  that  you \ncan go  directly  to  the  meanings  of  the  words  they  form.  If you \nare preoccupied  with  the  shapes  of  the  letters,  you  will  be  an \nintolerably  inefficient  reader,  likely  to  be  thought  stupid.  If  you \nhave  learned  how  to  get  to  meanings  without  aesthetic  distrac-\ntion,  you  are  required  to  assume  an  attitude  of  detachment  and \nobjectivity.  This  includes  your  bringing  to  the  task  what"

But  at  the  same  time,  you  must \nbe able  to  tell  from  the  tone  of the  language  what  is  the author's \nattitude  toward  the  subject  and  toward  the  reader.  You must,  in \nother  words,  know  the  difference  between  a  joke  and  an  argu-\nment.  And  in  judging  the  quality  of  an  argument,  you  must  be \nable to  do  several  things  at  once,  including  delaying  a  verdict \nuntil  the  entire  argument  is  finished,  holding  in  mind  questions \nuntil  you  have  determined  where,  when  or  if  the  text  answers \nthem,  and  bringing  to  bear  on  the  text  all  of your  relevant  expe-\nrience  as  a  counterargument  to  what  is  being  proposed.  You \nmust  also  be  able  to  withhold  those  parts  of  your  knowledge \nand experience  which,  in  fact,  do  not  have  a  bearing  on  the \nargument.  And  in  preparing  yourself  to  do  all  of this,  you  must \nhave  divested  yourself  of  the  belief  that  words  are  magical  and, \nabove  all,  have  learned  to  negotiate  the  world  of  abstractions, \nfor there  are  very  few  phrases  and  sentences  in  this  book  that \nrequire  you  to  call  forth  concrete  images.  In  a  print-culture,  we \nare apt  to  say  of  people  who  are  not  intelligent  that  we  must \n\"draw  them  pictures\"  so  that  they  may  understand.  Intelligence \nimplies  that  one  can  dwell  comfortably  without  pictures,  in  a \nfield of  concepts  and  generalizations. \nTo be  able  to  do  all  of  these  things,  and  more,  constitutes  a \nprimary  definition  of  intelligence  in  a  culture  whose  notions  of \ntruth  are  organized  around  the  printed  word.  In  the  next  two \nchapters  I  want  to  show  that  in  the  eighteenth  and  nineteenth \ncenturies,  America  was  such  a  place,  perhaps  the  most  print-\noriented  culture  ever  to  have  existed.  In  subsequent  chapters,  I \nwant  to  show  that  in  the  twentieth  century,  our  notions  of truth \nand our  ideas  of  intelligence  have  changed  as  a  result  of  new \nmedia  displacing  the  old. \nBut I  do  not  wish  to  oversimplify  the  matter  more  than  is \nnecessary.

    "raw_text": "Media as  Epistemology 27 \npoints  that  may  serve  as  a defense  against  certain  counterargu-\nments  that  careful  readers  may  have  already  formed. \nThe first  is  that  at  no  point  do  I  care  to  claim  that  changes  in \nmedia  bring  about  changes  in  the  structure  of  people's  minds  or \nchanges  in  their  cognitive  capacities.  There  are  some  who  make \nthis claim,  or  come  close  to  it  (for  example,  Jerome  Bruner, \nJack  Goody,  Walter  Ong,  Marshall  McLuhan,  Julian  Jaynes, \nand Eric  Havelock).7  I  am  inclined  to  think  they  are  right,  but \nmy argument  does  not  require  it.  Therefore,  I  will  not  burden \nmyself with  arguing  the  possibility,  for  example,  that  oral  peo-\nple are  less  developed  intellectually,  in  some  Piagetian  sense, \nthan  writing  people,  or  that  \"television\"  people  are  less  de-\nveloped  intellectually  than  either.  My  argument  is  limited  to \nsaying  that  a  major  new  medium  changes  the  structure  of  dis-\ncourse;  it  does  so  by encouraging  certain  uses  of the  intellect,  by \nfavoring  certain  definitions  of intelligence  and  wisdom,  and  by \ndemanding  a  certain  kind  of  content—in  a  phrase,  by  creating \nnew  forms  of  truth-telling.  I  will  say  once  again  that  I  am  no \nrelativist  in  this  matter,  and  that  I  believe  the  epistemology  cre-\nated  by  television  not  only  is  inferior  to a print-based  epistemol-\nogy but  is  dangerous  and  absurdist. \nThe second  point  is  that  the  epistemological  shift  I have  inti-\nmated,  and  will  describe  in  detail,  has  not  yet  included  (and \nperhaps  never  will  include)  everyone  and  everything.  While \nsome  old  media  do,  in  fact,  disappear  (e.g.,  pictographic  writing \nand illuminated  manuscripts)  and  with  them,  the  institutions \nand cognitive  habits  they  favored,  other  forms  of  conversation \nwill always  remain.  Speech,  for  example,  and  writing.  Thus  the \nepistemology  of  new  forms  such  as  television  does  not  have  an \nentirely  unchallenged  influence. \nI find  it  useful  to  think  of  the  situation  in  this  way:  Changes \nin the  symbolic  environment  are  like  changes  in  the  natural \nenvironment;  they  are  both  gradual  and  additive  at  first,  and \nthen,  all  at  once,  a  critical  mass  is  achieved,  as  the  physicists \nsay. A  river  that  has  slowly  been  polluted  suddenly  becomes\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to Death 28 \ntoxic;  most  of  the  fish  perish;  swimming  becomes  a  danger  to \nhealth.  But  even  then,  the  river  may  look  the  same  and  one \nmay still  take  a  boat  ride  on  it.  In  other  words,  even  when  life \nhas been  taken  from  it,  the  river  does  not  disappear,  nor  do  all \nof its  uses,  but  its  value  has  been  seriously  diminished  and  its \ndegraded  condition  will  have  harmful  effects  throughout  the \nlandscape.  It  is  this  way  with  our  symbolic  environment.  We \nhave  reached,  I  believe,  a  critical  mass  in  that  electronic  media \nhave  decisively  and  irreversibly  changed  the  character  of  our \nsymbolic  environment.  We  are  now  a  culture  whose  informa-\ntion,  ideas  and  epistemology  are  given  form  by  television,  not \nby the  printed  word.  To  be sure,  there  are  still readers  and  there \nare many  books  published,  but  the  uses  of print  and  reading  are \nnot the  same  as  they  once  were;  not  even  in  schools,  the  last \ninstitutions  where  print  was  thought  to  be  invincible.  They de-\nlude  themselves  who  believe  that  television  and  print  coexist, \nfor coexistence  implies  parity.  There  is  no  parity  here.  Print  is \nnow  merely  a  residual  epistemology,  and  it  will  remain  so, \naided  to  some  extent  by  the  computer,  and  newspapers  and \nmagazines  that  are  made  to  look  like  television  screens.  Like  the \nfish who  survive  a  toxic  river  and  the  boatmen  who  sail  on  it, \nthere  still  dwell  among  us  those  whose  sense  of things  is largely \ninfluenced  by  older  and  clearer  waters. \nThe third  point  is  that  in  the  analogy  I  have  drawn  above,  the \nriver refers  largely  to  what  we  call  public  discourse—our  politi-\ncal, religious,  informational  and  commercial  forms  of conversa-\ntion.  I  am arguing  that  a  television-based  epistemology  pollutes \npublic  communication  and  its  surrounding  landscape,  not  that \nit pollutes  everything.  In  the  first  place,  I  am  constantly  re-\nminded  of  television's  value  as  a source  of comfort  and  pleasure \nto the  elderly,  the  infirm  and,  indeed,  all  people  who  find  them-\nselves  alone  in  motel  rooms.  I  am also  aware  of  television's  po-\ntential  for  creating  a  theater  for  the  masses  (a  subject  which  in \nmy opinion  has  not  been  taken  seriously  enough).  There  are \nalso claims  that  whatever  power  television  might  have  to  un-\n\f\nMedia as  Epistemology 29 \ndermine  rational  discourse,  its  emotional  power  is  so great  that \nit could  arouse  sentiment  against  the  Vietnam  War  or  against \nmore  virulent  forms  of racism.  These  and  other  beneficial  possi-\nbilities are  not  to  be  taken  lightly. \nBut there  is  still  another  reason  why  I  should  not  like  to  be \nunderstood  as  making  a total  assault  on  television.  Anyone  who \nis even  slightly  familiar  with  the  history  of  communications \nknows  that  every  new  technology  for  thinking  involves  a trade-\noff. It giveth  and  taketh  away,  although  not  quite  in  equal  mea-\nsure.  Media  change  does  not  necessarily  result  in  equilibrium.  It \nsometimes  creates  more  than  it  destroys.  Sometimes,  it  is  the \nother  way  around.  We  must  be  careful  in praising  or  condemn-\ning because  the  future  may  hold  surprises  for  us.  The  invention \nof the  printing  press  itself  is  a paradigmatic  example.  Typogra-\nphy fostered  the  modern  idea  of  individuality,  but  it  destroyed \nthe medieval  sense  of  community  and  integration.  Typography \ncreated  prose  but  made  poetry  into  an  exotic  and  elitist  form \nof expression.  Typography  made  modern  science  possible  but \ntransformed  religious  sensibility  into  mere  superstition.  Typog-\nraphy  assisted  in  the  growth  of  the  nation-state  but  thereby \nmade  patriotism  into  a  sordid  if  not  lethal  emotion. \nObviously,  my  point  of  view  is  that  the  four-hundred-year \nimperial  dominance  of  typography  was  of  far  greater  benefit \nthan  deficit.  Most  of  our  modern  ideas  about  the  uses  of  the \nintellect  were  formed  by  the  printed  word,  as  were  our  ideas \nabout  education,  knowledge,  truth  and  information.  I  will  try \nto demonstrate  that  as  typography  moves  to  the  periphery  of \nour culture  and  television  takes  its  place  at  the  center,  the \nseriousness,  clarity  and,  above  all,  value  of  public  discourse \ndangerously  declines.  On  what  benefits  may  come  from  other \ndirections,  one  must  keep  an  open  mind."

    "raw_text": "In the  Autobiography of  Benjamin Franklin,  there  appears  a  re-\nmarkable quotation  attributed  to  Michael  Welfare,  one  of  the \nfounders  of a religious  sect  known  as  the Dunkers  and  a long-\ntime acquaintance  of  Franklin. The statement  had  its origins in \nWelfare's complaint  to  Franklin  that  zealots  of  other  religious \npersuasions  were  spreading  lies  about  the  Dunkers,  accusing \nthem of abominable  principles to which,  in  fact, they were utter \nstrangers. Franklin  suggested  that  such  abuse  might  be  dimin-\nished if the Dunkers  published  the articles of their belief and the \nrules of  their  discipline.  Welfare  replied that  this  course  of  ac-\ntion had been  discussed  among  his  co-religionists  but had been \nrejected. He  then  explained  their  reasoning  in  the  following \nwords: \nWhen we  were  first drawn  together  as  a society, it had  pleased \nGod to enlighten our  minds so far as to see that some doctrines, \nwhich we  once  esteemed  truths,  were  errors,  and  that  others, \nwhich we  had  esteemed  errors,  were  real  truths.  From  time  to \ntime He has been pleased to afford us farther light, and our princi-\nples have  been  improving, and  our  errors diminishing. Now we \nare not sure that we are arrived at the end of this progression, and \nat the perfection of spiritual or theological knowledge; and we fear \nthat, if we should feel ourselves as if bound and confined by it, and \nperhaps be  unwilling  to  receive further  improvement,  and  our \nsuccessors still more  so, as conceiving what  we  their  elders and \nfounders had done,  to be something sacred, never to be departed \nfrom.1 \n30 \nTypographic \nAmerica \n3.\n\f\nTypographic America 31 \nFranklin  describes  this  sentiment  as  a singular  instance  in  the \nhistory  of  mankind  of  modesty  in  a  sect.  Modesty  is  certainly \nthe word  for  it, but  the  statement  is  extraordinary  for  other  rea-\nsons,  too.  We  have  here  a  criticism  of  the  epistemology  of  the \nwritten  word  worthy  of  Plato.  Moses  himself  might  be  inter-\nested although  he  could  hardly  approve.  The  Dunkers  came \nclose here  to  formulating  a  commandment  about  religious  dis-\ncourse:  Thou  shalt  not  write  down  thy  principles,  still  less  print \nthem,  lest  thou  shall  be  entrapped  by  them  for  all time. \nWe may,  in  any  case,  consider  it  a  significant  loss  that  we \nhave  no  record  of  the  deliberations  of  the  Dunkers.  It  would \ncertainly  shed  light  on  the  premise  of  this  book,  i.e.,  that  the \nform  in  which  ideas  are  expressed  affects  what  those  ideas  will \nbe. But  more  important,  their  deliberations  were  in  all  likeli-\nhood  a  singular  instance  in  Colonial  America  of  a distrust  of the \nprinted  word.  For  the  Americans  among  whom  Franklin  lived \nwere  as  committed  to  the  printed  word  as  any  group  of  people \nwho  have  ever  lived.  Whatever  else  may  be  said  of  those  immi-\ngrants  who  came  to  settle  in  New  England,  it  is  a  paramount \nfact that  they  and  their  heirs  were  dedicated  and  skillful  readers \nwhose  religious  sensibilities,  political  ideas  and  social  life  were \nembedded  in  the  medium  of  typography. \nWe know  that  on  the  Mayflower itself  several  books  were  in-\ncluded  as  cargo,  most  importantly,  the  Bible  and  Captain  John \nSmith's  Description  of  New  England.  (For  immigrants  headed \ntoward  a  largely  uncharted  land,  we  may  suppose  that  the  latter \nbook  was  as carefully  read  as  the  former.)  We  know,  too,  that  in \nthe very  first  days  of  colonization  each  minister  was  given  ten \npounds  with  which  to  start  a  religious  library.  And  although \nliteracy  rates  are  notoriously  difficult  to assess,  there  is sufficient \nevidence  (mostly  drawn  from  signatures)  that  between  1640 \nand 1700,  the  literacy  rate  for  men  in  Massachusetts  and  Con-\nnecticut  was  somewhere  between  89  percent  and  95  percent, \nquite  probably  the  highest  concentration  of  literate  males  to  be \nfound  anywhere  in  the  world  at  that  time.2  (The  literacy  rate  for\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to Death 32 \nwomen  in  those  colonies  is  estimated  to  have  run  as  high  as  62 \npercent  in  the  years  1681-1697.3) \nIt is  to  be  understood  that  the  Bible  was  the  central  reading \nmatter  in  all  households,  for  these  people  were  Protestants who \nshared  Luther's  belief  that  printing  was  \"God's  highest  and  ex-\ntremest  act  of  Grace,  whereby  the  business  of  the  Gospel  is \ndriven  forward.\"  Of  course,  the  business  of  the  Gospel  may  be \ndriven  forward  in  books  other  than  the  Bible,  as  for  example  in \nthe  famous  Bay  Psalm  Book,  printed  in  1640  and  generally  re-\ngarded  as  America's  first  best  seller.  But  it  is not  to  be  assumed \nthat  these  people  confined  their  reading  to  religious  matters. \nProbate records  indicate  that  60  percent  of  the  estates  in  Mid-\ndlesex  County  between  the  years  1654  and  1699  contained \nbooks,  all  but  8  percent  of  them  including  more  than  the  Bible.4 \nIn fact,  between  1682  and  1685,  Boston's  leading  bookseller \nimported  3,421  books  from  one  English  dealer,  most  of  these \nnonreligious  books.  The  meaning  of  this  fact  may  be  appreci-\nated  when  one  adds  that  these  books  were  intended  for  con-\nsumption  by  approximately  75,000  people  then  living  in  the \nnorthern  colonies.5  The  modern  equivalent  would  be  ten  mil-\nlion books. \nAside  from  the  fact  that  the  religion  of  these  Calvinist  Puri-\ntans  demanded  that  they  be  literate,  three  other  factors  account \nfor the  colonists'  preoccupation  with  the  printed  word.  Since \nthe  male  literacy  rate  in  seventeenth-century  England  did  not \nexceed  40  percent,  we  may  assume,  first of  all,  that  the  migrants \nto New  England  came  from  more  literate  areas  of  England  or \nfrom  more  literate  segments  of  the  population,  or  both.6  In \nother  words,  they  came  here  as  readers  and  were  certain  to  be-\nlieve  that  reading  was  as  important  in  the  New  World  as  it was \nin the  Old.  Second,  from  1650  onward  almost  all  New  England \ntowns  passed  laws  requiring  the  maintenance  of  a \"reading  and \nwriting\"  school,  the  large  communities  being  required  to  main-\ntain  a  grammar  school,  as  well.7  In  all  such  laws,  reference  is \nmade  to  Satan,  whose  evil  designs,  it  was  supposed,  could  be\n\f\nTypographic America 33 \nthwarted  at  every  turn  by  education.  But  there  were  other  rea-\nsons why  education  was  required,  as  suggested  by  the  following \nditty,  popular  in  the  seventeenth  century: \nFrom public schools shall general \nknowledge flow, \nFor 'tis  the people's sacred \nright to know.8 \nThese people,  in  other  words,  had  more  than  the  subjection \nof Satan  on  their  minds.  Beginning  in  the  sixteenth  century,  a \ngreat epistemological  shift  had  taken  place  in  which  knowledge \nof every  kind  was  transferred  to,  and  made  manifest  through, \nthe printed  page.  \"More  than  any  other  device,\"  Lewis  Mum-\nford wrote  of  this  shift,  \"the  printed  book  released  people  from \nthe domination  of  the  immediate  and  the  local;  .  . . print  made  a \ngreater  impression  than  actual  events.  .  . . To exist  was  to  exist \nin print:  the  rest  of the  world  tended  gradually  to  become  more \nshadowy.  Learning  became  book-learning.\"9  In  light  of  this, \nwe may  assume  that  the  schooling  of the  young  was  understood \nby the  colonists  not  only  as  a  moral  duty  but  as  an  intellectual \nimperative.  (The  England  from  which  they  came  was  an  island \nof schools.  By  1660,  for  example,  there  were  444  schools  in \nEngland,  one  school  approximately  every  twelve  miles.10)  And \nit is  clear  that  growth  in  literacy  was  closely  connected  to \nschooling.  Where  schooling  was  not  required  (as  in  Rhode  Is-\nland)  or  weak  school  laws  prevailed  (as  in  New  Hampshire), \nliteracy  rates  increased  more  slowly  than  elsewhere. \nFinally,  these  displaced  Englishmen  did  not  need  to  print \ntheir  own  books  or  even  nurture  their  own  writers.  They  im-\nported,  whole,  a  sophisticated  literary  tradition  from  their \nMotherland.  In  1736,  booksellers  advertised  the  availability  of \nthe Spectator,  the  Tatler,  and  Steele's  Guardian.  In  1738,  adver-\ntisements  appeared  for  Locke's  Essay  Concerning Human Under-\nstanding, Pope's  Homer,  Swift's  A  Tale  of  a  Tub  and  Dryden's\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to Death 34 \nFables.11 Timothy  Dwight,  president  of  Yale  University,  de-\nscribed  the  American  situation  succinctly: \nBooks of almost every kind,  on almost every subject, are already \nwritten to  our  hands.  Our  situation  in  this respect is singular. As \nwe speak the same language with the people of Great Britain, and \nhave usually been at peace with that country; our commerce with \nit brings to us, regularly, not a small part of the books with which \nit is deluged. In every art, science, and path of literature, we obtain \nthose, which to a great extent supply our wants.12 \nOne  significant  implication  of  this  situation  is  that  no  literary \naristocracy  emerged  in  Colonial  America.  Reading  was  not  re-\ngarded  as  an  elitist  activity,  and  printed  matter  was  spread \nevenly  among  all  kinds  of  people.  A  thriving,  classless  reading \nculture  developed  because,  as  Daniel  Boorstin  writes,  \"It  was \ndiffuse.  Its  center  was  everywhere  because  it  was  nowhere. \nEvery man  was  close  to  what  [printed  matter]  talked  about. \nEveryone  could  speak  the  same  language.  It  was  the  product  of \na busy,  mobile,  public  society.\"  13  By  1772,  Jacob  Duché  could \nwrite:  \"The  poorest  labourer  upon  the  shore  of  the  Delaware \nthinks  himself  entitled  to  deliver  his  sentiment  in  matters  of  re-\nligion  or  politics  with  as  much  freedom  as  the  gentleman  or \nscholar.  .  . . Such  is  the  prevailing  taste  for  books  of  every  kind, \nthat  almost  every  man  is  a reader.\"  14 \nWhere  such  a  keen  taste  for  books  prevailed  among  the  gen-\neral population,  we  need  not  be  surprised  that  Thomas  Paine's \nCommon Sense,  published  on  January  10,  1776,  sold  more  than \n100,000  copies  by  March  of  the  same  year.15  In  1985,  a  book \nwould  have  to  sell  eight  million  copies  (in  two  months)  to \nmatch  the  proportion  of  the  population  Paine's book  attracted. \nIf we  go  beyond  March,  1776,  a  more  awesome  set  of figures  is \ngiven  by  Howard  Fast:  \"No  one  knows  just  how  many  copies \nwere  actually  printed.  The  most  conservative  sources  place  the \nfigure at  something  over  300,000  copies.  Others  place  it  just\n\f\nTypographic America 35 \nunder  half  a  million.  Taking  a  figure  of  400,000  in  a  popula-\ntion of  3,000,000,  a  book  published  today  would  have  to  sell \n24,000,000  copies  to  do  as  well.\"  16  The  only  communication \nevent  that  could  produce  such  collective  attention  in  today's \nAmerica  is  the  Superbowl. \nIt is  worth  pausing  here  for  a  moment  to  say  something  of \nThomas  Paine,  for  in  an  important  way  he  is  a measure  of  the \nhigh and  wide  level  of  literacy  that  existed  in  his  time.  In  par-\nticular,  I  want  to  note  that  in  spite  of his  lowly  origins,  no  ques-\ntion has  ever  been  raised,  as  it  has  with  Shakespeare,  about \nwhether  or  not  Paine  was,  in  fact,  the  author  of  the  works  at-\ntributed  to  him.  It  is true  that  we  know  more  of Paine's  life  than \nShakespeare's  (although  not  more  of Paine's  early  periods),  but \nit is also  true  that  Paine  had  less  formal  schooling  than  Shake-\nspeare,  and  came  from  the  lowest  laboring  class  before  he  ar-\nrived in  America.  In  spite  of  these  disadvantages,  Paine  wrote \npolitical  philosophy  and  polemics  the  equal  in  lucidity  and  vi-\ntality (although  not  quantity)  of  Voltaire's,  Rousseau's,  and \ncontemporary  English  philosophers',  including  Edmund  Burke. \nYet no  one  asked  the  question,  How  could  an  unschooled  stay-\nmaker  from  England's  impoverished  class  produce  such  stun-\nning  prose?  From  time  to  time  Paine's  lack  of  education  was \npointed  out  by  his  enemies  (and  he,  himself,  felt  inferior  be-\ncause  of  this  deficiency),  but  it  was  never  doubted  that  such \npowers  of  written  expression  could  originate  from  a  common \nman. \nIt is  also  worth  mentioning  that  the  full  title  of  Paine's  most \nwidely  read  book  is  Common Sense,  Written  by  an  Englishman. \nThe tagline  is  important  here  because,  as  noted  earlier,  Amer-\nicans did  not  write  many  books  in  the  Colonial  period,  which \nBenjamin  Franklin  tried  to  explain  by  claiming  that  Americans \nwere  too  busy  doing  other  things.  Perhaps  so.  But  Americans \nwere  not  too  busy  to  make  use  of the  printing  press,  even  if not \nfor books  they  themselves  had  written.  The  first  printing  press \nin America  was  established  in  1638  as  an  adjunct  of  Harvard"

    "raw_text": "Amusing Ourselves  to Death 36 \nUniversity,  which  was  two  years  old  at  the  time.17  Presses  were \nestablished  shortly  thereafter  in  Boston  and  Philadelphia  with-\nout  resistance  by  the  Crown,  a  curious  fact  since  at  this  time \npresses  were  not  permitted  in  Liverpool  and  Birmingham, \namong  other  English  cities.18  The  earliest  use  of  the  press  was \nfor the  printing  of  newsletters,  mostly  done  on  cheap  paper.  It \nmay well  be  that  the  development  of  an  American  literature \nwas retarded  not  by the  industry  of the  people  or  the  availability \nof English  literature  but  by  the  scarcity  of quality  paper.  As  late \nas Revolutionary  days,  George  Washington  was  forced  to  write \nto his  generals  on  unsightly  scraps  of  paper,  and  his  dispatches \nwere  not  enclosed  in  envelopes,  paper  being  too  scarce  for  such \nuse.19 \nYet by the  late  seventeenth  century,  there  was  a beginning  to \na native  literature  that  turned  out  to  have  as  much  to  do  with \nthe typographic  bias  of  American  culture  as  books.  I  refer,  of \ncourse,  to  the  newspaper,  at  which  Americans  first  tried  their \nhand  on  September  25,  1690,  in Boston,  when  Benjamin  Harris \nprinted  the  first  edition  of  a  three-page  paper  he  called  Publick \nOccurrences Both Foreign and Domestick. Before  he came  to  Amer-\nica, Harris  had  played  a  role  in  \"exposing\"  a  nonexistent  con-\nspiracy  of  Catholics  to  slaughter  Protestants  and  burn  London. \nHis London  newspaper,  Domestick  Intelligence,  revealed  the \n\"Popish  plot,\"  with  the  result  that  Catholics  were  harshly  per-\nsecuted.20  Harris,  no  stranger  to  mendacity,  indicated  in  his \nprospectus  for  Publick Occurrences  that  a  newspaper  was  neces-\nsary to  combat  the  spirit  of lying  which  then  prevailed  in  Boston \nand,  I  am  told,  still  does.  He  concluded  his  prospectus  with  the \nfollowing  sentence:  \"It  is  suppos'd  that  none  will  dislike  this \nProposal  but  such  as  intend  to  be  guilty  of  so  villainous  a \ncrime.\"  Harris  was  right  about  who  would  dislike  his  proposal. \nThe second  issue  of  Publick  Occurrences  never  appeared.  The \nGovernor  and  Council  suppressed  it,  complaining  that  Harris \nhad printed  \"reflections  of  a  very  high  nature,\"21  by  which \nthey  meant  that  they  had  no  intention  of  admitting  any  impedi-\n\f\nTypographic America 37 \nments  to  whatever  villainy  they  wished  to  pursue.  Thus,  in  the \nNew World  began  the  struggle  for  freedom  of  information \nwhich,  in  the  Old,  had  begun  a  century  before. \nHarris'  abortive  effort  inspired  other  attempts  at  newspaper \npublication:  for  example,  the  Boston  News-Letter,  published  in \n1704, generally  regarded  as  the  first  continuously  published \nAmerican  newspaper.  This  was  followed  by  the  Boston  Gazette \n(in 1719)  and  the  New-England Courant  (in  1721),  whose  editor, \nJames  Franklin,  was  the  older  brother  of  Benjamin.  By  1730, \nthere  were  seven  newspapers  published  regularly  in  four  colo-\nnies, and  by  1800  there  were  more  than  180.  In  1770,  the  New \nYork Gazette congratulated  itself  and  other  papers  by  writing  (in \npart): \n'Tis truth (with deference to the college) \nNewspapers are the spring of Knowledge, \nThe general source throughout the nation, \nOf every modern conversation.22 \nAt the  end  of  the  eighteenth  century,  the  Reverend  Samuel  Mil-\nler boasted  that  the  United  States  had  more  than  two-thirds  the \nnumber  of  newspapers  available  in  England,  and  yet  had  only \nhalf the  population  of  England.23 \nIn 1786,  Benjamin  Franklin  observed  that  Americans  were  so \nbusy reading  newspapers  and  pamphlets  that  they  scarcely  had \ntime for  books.  (One  book  they  apparently  always  had  time  for \nwas Noah  Webster's  American  Spelling  Book,  for  it  sold  more \nthan  24  million  copies  between  1783  and  1843.)24  Franklin's \nreference  to pamphlets  ought  not  to  go  unnoticed.  The  prolifer-\nation  of newspapers  in  all the  Colonies  was  accompanied  by  the \nrapid  diffusion  of pamphlets  and  broadsides.  Alexis  de  Tocque-\nville took  note  of this  fact  in his  Democracy in America, published \nin 1835:  \"In  America,\"  he  wrote,  \"parties  do  not  write  books  to \ncombat  each  other's  opinions,  but  pamphlets,  which  are  circu-\nlated for  a day  with  incredible  rapidity  and  then  expire.\"  25  And\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to Death 38 \nhe referred  to  both  newspapers  and  pamphlets  when  he  ob-\nserved,  \"the  invention  of  firearms  equalized  the  vassal  and  the \nnoble  on  the  field  of  battle;  the  art  of  printing  opened  the  same \nresources  to  the  minds  of  all  classes;  the  post  brought  knowl-\nedge  alike  to  the  door  of  the  cottage  and  to  the  gate  of  the \npalace.\"26 \nAt the  time  Tocqueville  was  making  his  observations  of \nAmerica,  printing  had  already  spread  to  all  the  regions  of  the \ncountry.  The  South  had  lagged  behind  the  North  not  only  in  the \nformation  of  schools  (almost  all  of  which  were  private  rather \nthan  public)  but  in  its  uses  of  the  printing  press.  Virginia,  for \nexample,  did  not  get  its  first regularly  published  newspaper,  the \nVirginia Gazette,  until  1736.  But  toward  the  end  of  the  eigh-\nteenth  century,  the  movement  of  ideas  via  the  printed  word  was \nrelatively  rapid,  and  something  approximating  a  national  con-\nversation  emerged.  For  example,  the  Federalist  Papers,  an  out-\npouring  of  eighty-five  essays  written  by  Alexander  Hamilton, \nJames  Madison,  and  John  Jay  (all  under  the  name  of  Publius) \noriginally  appeared  in  a  New  York  newspaper  during  1787  and \n1788  but  were  read  almost  as  widely  in  the  South  as  the  North. \nAs America  moved  into  the  nineteenth  century,  it  did  so  as  a \nfully  print-based  culture  in  all  of its  regions.  Between  1825  and \n1850,  the  number  of  subscription  libraries  trebled.27  What  were \ncalled  \"mechanics'  and  apprentices'  libraries\"—that  is,  libraries \nintended  for  the  working  class—also  emerged  as  a  force  for  lit-\neracy.  In  1829,  the  New  York  Apprentices'  Library  housed  ten \nthousand  volumes,  of  which  1,600  apprentices  drew  books.  By \n1857,  the  same  library  served  three-quarters  of  a  million  peo-\nple.28  Aided  by  Congress'  lowering  of  the  postal  rates  in  1851, \nthe  penny  newspaper,  the  periodical,  the  Sunday  school  tract, \nand  the  cheaply  bound  book  were  abundantly  available.  Be-\ntween  1836  and  1890,  107  million  copies  of the  McGuffey Reader \nwere  distributed  to  the  schools.29  And  although  the  reading  of \nnovels  was  not  considered  an  altogether  reputable  use  of  time, \nAmericans  devoured  them.  Of  Walter  Scott's  novels,  published\n\f\nTypographic America 39 \nbetween  1814  and  1832,  Samuel  Goodrich  wrote:  \"The  ap-\npearance  of a new  novel  from  his pen  caused  a  greater  sensation \nin the  United  States  than  did  some  of  the  battles  of  Napoleon. \n. .  .  Everybody  read  these  works;  everybody—the  refined  and \nthe simple.\"30  Publishers were  so  anxious  to  make  prospective \nbest sellers  available,  they  would  sometimes  dispatch  messen-\ngers to  incoming  packet  boats  and  \"within  a  single  day  set  up, \nprinted  and  bound  in  paper  covers  the  most  recent  novel \nof Bulwer  or  Dickens.\"31  There  being  no  international  copy-\nright  laws,  \"pirated\"  editions  abounded,  with  no  complaint \nfrom  the  public,  or  much  from  authors,  who  were  lionized. \nWhen  Charles  Dickens  visited  America  in  1842,  his  reception \nequaled  the  adulation  we  offer  today  to  television  stars,  quarter-\nbacks,  and  Michael  Jackson.  \"I  can  give  you  no  conception  of \nmy welcome,\"  Dickens  wrote  to  a  friend.  \"There  never  was  a \nKing or  Emperor  upon  earth  so  cheered  and  followed  by  the \ncrowds,  and  entertained  at  splendid  balls  and  dinners  and \nwaited  upon  by  public  bodies  of  all  kinds.  .  .  .  If I  go  out  in  a \ncarriage,  the  crowd  surrounds  it  and  escorts  me  home;  if  I go to \nthe theater,  the  whole  house  .  . . rises  as  one  man  and  the  tim-\nbers ring  again.\"32  A  native  daughter,  Harriet  Beecher  Stowe, \nwas not  offered  the  same  kind  of  adoring  attention—and,  of \ncourse,  in  the  South,  had  her  carriage  been  surrounded,  it \nwould  not  have  been  for  the  purpose  of  escorting  her  home— \nbut her  Uncle  Tom's Cabin  sold  305,000  copies  in  its  first  year, \nthe equivalent  of  four  million  in  today's  America. \nAlexis  de  Tocqueville  was  not  the  only  foreign  visitor  to  be \nimpressed  by  the  Americans'  immersion  in  printed  matter.  Dur-\ning the  nineteenth  century,  scores  of  Englishmen  came  to \nAmerica  to  see  for  themselves  what  had  become  of  the  Colo-\nnies.  All  were  impressed  with  the  high  level  of  literacy  and  in \nparticular  its  extension  to  all  classes.33 \nIn addition,  they  were  astounded  by  the  near  universality  of \nlecture  halls  in  which  stylized  oral  performance  provided  a  con-\ntinuous  reinforcement  of  the  print  tradition.  Many  of  these  lec-\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to Death 40 \nture  halls  originated  as  a  result  of  the  Lyceum  Movement,  a \nform  of  adult  education.  Usually  associated  with  the  efforts  of \nJosiah  Holbrook,  a  New  England  farmer,  the  Lyceum  Move-\nment  had  as  its  purpose  the  diffusion  of knowledge,  the  pro-\nmotion  of  common  schools,  the  creation  of  libraries  and, \nespecially,  the  establishment  of  lecture  halls.  By  1835,  there \nwere  more  than  three  thousand  Lyceums  in  fifteen  states.34 \nMost of these  were  located  east  of the  Alleghenies,  but  by  1840, \nthey  were  to  be  found  at  the  edges  of the  frontier,  as far  west  as \nIowa  and  Minnesota.  Alfred  Bunn,  an  Englishman  on  an  exten-\nsive tour  through  America,  reported  in  1853  that  \"practically \nevery  village  had  its  lecture  hall.\"35  He  added:  \"It  is  a matter  of \nwonderment  .  .  .  to  witness  the  youthful  workmen,  the  over-\ntired artisan,  the  worn-out  factory  girl .  . . rushing  .  . . after  the \ntoil of  the  day  is  over,  into  the  hot  atmosphere  of  a  crowded \nlecture  room.\"36  Bunn's  countryman  J.  F.  W.  Johnston  at-\ntended  lectures  at  this  time  at  the  Smithsonian  Institution  and \n\"found  the  lecture  halls  jammed  with  capacity  audiences  of \n1200 and  1500  people.\"  37  Among  the  lecturers  these  audiences \ncould  hear  were  the  leading  intellectuals,  writers  and  humorists \n(who  were  also  writers)  of  their  time,  including  Henry  Ward \nBeecher,  Horace  Greeley,  Louis  Agassiz  and  Ralph  Waldo  Em-\nerson  (whose  fee  for  a lecture  was  fifty  dollars).38  In  his  auto-\nbiography,  Mark  Twain  devotes  two  chapters  to  his  experiences \nas a  lecturer  on  the  Lyceum  circuit.  \"I  began  as  a  lecturer  in \n1866 in  California  and  Nevada,\"  he  wrote.  \"[I]  lectured  in  New \nYork once  and  in  the  Mississippi  Valley  a few  times;  in  1868  [I] \nmade  the  whole  Western  circuit;  and  in  the  two  or three  follow-\ning seasons  added  the  Eastern  circuit  to  my  route.\"39  Appar-\nently,  Emerson  was  underpaid  since  Twain  remarks  that  some \nlecturers  charged  as  much  as  $250  when  they  spoke  in  towns \nand $400  when  they  spoke  in  cities  (which  is  almost  as  much, \nin today's  terms,  as  the  going  price  for  a  lecture  by  a  retired \ntelevision  newscaster). \nThe point  all  this  is  leading  to  is  that  from  its beginning  until\n\f\nTypographic America 41 \nwell into  the  nineteenth  century,  America  was  as  dominated  by \nthe printed  word  and  an  oratory  based  on  the  printed  word  as \nany society  we  know  of.  This situation  was  only  in  part  a  legacy \nof the  Protestant  tradition.  As  Richard  Hofstadter  reminds  us, \nAmerica  was  founded  by  intellectuals,  a  rare  occurrence  in  the \nhistory  of  modern  nations.  \"The  Founding  Fathers,\"  he  writes, \n\"were  sages,  scientists,  men  of  broad  cultivation,  many  of  them \napt in  classical  learning,  who  used  their  wide  reading  in  history, \npolitics,  and  law  to  solve  the  exigent  problems  of  their  time.\"40 \nA society  shaped  by  such  men  does  not  easily  move  in  contrary \ndirections.  We  might  even  say  that  America  was  founded  by \nintellectuals,  from  which  it  has  taken  us  two  centuries  and  a \ncommunications  revolution  to  recover.  Hofstadter  has  written \nconvincingly  of  our  efforts  to  \"recover,\"  that  is  to  say,  of  the \nanti-intellectual  strain  in  American  public  life,  but  he  concedes \nthat  his  focus  distorts  the  general  picture.  It  is akin  to  writing  a \nhistory  of American  business  by  concentrating  on  the  history  of \nbankruptcies.41 \nThe influence  of  the  printed  word  in  every  arena  of  public \ndiscourse  was  insistent  and  powerful  not  merely  because  of  the \nquantity  of  printed  matter  but  because  of  its  monopoly.  This \npoint  cannot  be  stressed  enough,  especially  for  those  who  are \nreluctant  to  acknowledge  profound  differences  in the  media  en-\nvironments  of  then  and  now.  One  sometimes  hears  it  said,  for \nexample,  that  there  is  more  printed  matter  available  today  than \never before,  which  is  undoubtedly  true.  But  from  the  seven-\nteenth  century  to  the  late  nineteenth  century,  printed  matter \nwas virtually  all  that  was  available.  There  were  no  movies  to \nsee, radio  to  hear,  photographic  displays  to  look  at,  records  to \nplay. There  was  no  television.  Public  business  was  channeled \ninto  and  expressed  through  print,  which  became  the  model,  the \nmetaphor  and  the  measure  of  all  discourse.  The  resonances  of \nthe lineal,  analytical  structure  of  print,  and  in  particular,  of  ex-\npository  prose,  could  be  felt  everywhere.  For  example,  in  how \npeople  talked.  Tocqueville  remarks  on  this  in  Democracy  in\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to Death 42 \nAmerica. \"An  American,\"  he  wrote,  \"cannot  converse,  but  he \ncan discuss,  and  his  talk  falls  into  a  dissertation.  He  speaks  to \nyou as  if he  was  addressing  a  meeting;  and  if  he  should  chance \nto become  warm  in  the  discussion,  he  will  say  'Gentlemen'  to \nthe person  with  whom  he  is conversing.\"42  This  odd  practice  is \nless a reflection  of an  American's  obstinacy  than  of his modeling \nhis conversational  style  on  the  structure  of  the  printed  word. \nSince the  printed  word  is  impersonal  and  is  addressed  to  an \ninvisible  audience,  what  Tocqueville  is  describing  here  is a kind \nof printed  orality,  which  was  observable  in  diverse  forms  of oral \ndiscourse.  On  the  pulpit,  for  example,  sermons  were  usually \nwritten  speeches  delivered  in  a stately,  impersonal  tone  consist-\ning \"largely  of  an  impassioned,  coldly  analytical  cataloguing  of \nthe attributes  of  the  Deity  as  revealed  to  man  through  Nature \nand  Nature's  Laws.\"43  And  even  when  The  Great  Awakening \ncame—a  revivalist  movement  that  challenged  the  analytical, \ndispassionate  spirit  of  Deism—its  highly  emotional  preachers \nused  an  oratory  that  could  be  transformed  easily  to  the  printed \npage.  The  most  charismatic  of  these  men  was  the  Reverend \nGeorge  Whitefield,  who  beginning  in  1739  preached  all  over \nAmerica  to  large  crowds.  In  Philadelphia,  he  addressed  an  au-\ndience  of  ten  thousand  people,  whom  he  deeply  stirred  and \nalarmed  by  assuring  them  of  eternal  hellfire  if they  refused  to \naccept  Christ.  Benjamin  Franklin  witnessed  one  of  Whitefield's \nperformances  and  responded  by  offering  to  become  his  pub-\nlisher.  In  due  time,  Whitefield's  journals  and  sermons  were \npublished  by  B.  Franklin  of  Philadelphia.44 \nBut obviously  I  do  not  mean  to  say  that  print  merely  influ-\nenced  the  form  of  public  discourse.  That  does  not  say  much \nunless  one  connects  it  to the  more  important  idea  that  form  will \ndetermine  the  nature  of  content.  For  those  readers  who  may \nbelieve  that  this  idea  is  too  \"McLuhanesque\"  for  their  taste,  I \noffer  Karl  Marx  from  The  German  Ideology.  \"Is  the  Iliad  possi-\nble,\"  he  asks  rhetorically,  \"when  the  printing  press  and  even \nprinting  machines  exist?  Is  it not  inevitable  that  with  the  emer-\n\f\nTypographic America 43 \ngence  of  the  press,  the  singing  and  the  telling  and  the  muse \ncease;  that  is,  the  conditions  necessary  for  epic  poetry  disap-\npear?\"45  Marx  understood  well  that  the  press  was  not  merely  a \nmachine  but  a structure  for  discourse,  which  both  rules  out  and \ninsists upon  certain  kinds  of  content  and,  inevitably,  a  certain \nkind  of  audience.  He  did  not,  himself,  fully  explore  the  matter, \nand others  have  taken  up  the  task.  I  too  must  try  my  hand  at \nit—to  explore  how  the  press  worked  as  a  metaphor  and  an \nepistemology  to  create  a  serious  and  rational  public  conversa-\ntion,  from  which  we  have  now  been  so  dramatically  separated."

    "raw_text": "The Typographic Mind \nThe first of the  seven  famous  debates  between  Abraham  Lincoln \nand Stephen  A.  Douglas  took  place  on  August  21,  1858,  in Ot-\ntawa, Illinois.  Their  arrangement  provided  that  Douglas  would \nspeak first, for  one hour;  Lincoln  would  take  an hour  and  a half \nto reply;  Douglas,  a  half  hour  to  rebut  Lincoln's  reply.  This de-\nbate was  considerably  shorter  than  those  to  which  the  two  men \nwere  accustomed.  In  fact,  they  had  tangled  several  times  before, \nand all  of their  encounters  had  been  much  lengthier  and  more \nexhausting.  For  example,  on  October  16,  1854,  in  Peoria, Illi-\nnois, Douglas  delivered  a  three-hour  address  to  which  Lincoln, \nby agreement,  was  to  respond.  When  Lincoln's  turn  came,  he \nreminded  the  audience  that  it was already  5  p.m.,  that  he  would \nprobably  require  as much  time  as Douglas and  that  Douglas  was \nstill scheduled  for  a  rebuttal.  He  proposed,  therefore,  that  the \naudience  go  home,  have  dinner,  and  return  refreshed  for  four \nmore  hours  of talk.1  The  audience  amiably  agreed,  and  matters \nproceeded  as  Lincoln  had  outlined. \nWhat  kind  of audience  was  this?  Who  were  these  people  who \ncould so  cheerfully  accommodate  themselves  to  seven  hours  of \noratory?  It should  be  noted,  by the  way,  that  Lincoln  and  Doug-\nlas were  not  presidential  candidates;  at  the  time  of  their  en-\ncounter  in  Peoria they  were  not  even  candidates  for  the  United \nStates Senate.  But  their  audiences  were  not  especially  con-\ncerned  with  their  official  status.  These  were  people  who  re-\ngarded  such  events  as essential  to  their  political  education,  who \ntook them  to  be  an  integral  part  of  their  social  lives,  and  who \n44 \n4.\n\f\nThe Typographic Mind 45 \nwere  quite  accustomed  to  extended  oratorical  performances. \nTypically at  county  or  state  fairs,  programs  included  many \nspeakers,  most  of  whom  were  allotted  three  hours  for  their  ar-\nguments.  And  since  it  was  preferred  that  speakers  not  go  un-\nanswered,  their  opponents  were  allotted  an  equal  length  of \ntime.  (One  might  add  that  the  speakers  were  not  always  men. \nAt one  fair  lasting  several  days  in  Springfield,  \"Each  evening  a \nwoman  [lectured]  in  the  courtroom  on  'Woman's  Influence  in \nthe Great  Progressive  Movements  of  the  Day.'  \"2) \nMoreover,  these  people  did  not  rely  on  fairs  or special  events \nto get  their  fill of oratory.  The  tradition  of  the  \"stump\"  speaker \nwas widely  practiced,  especially  in  the  western  states.  By  the \nstump  of  a felled  tree  or  some  equivalent  open  space,  a  speaker \nwould  gather  an  audience,  and,  as  the  saying  had  it,  \"take  the \nstump\"  for  two  or  three  hours.  Although  audiences  were \nmostly  respectful  and  attentive,  they  were  not  quiet  or  unemo-\ntional.  Throughout  the  Lincoln-Douglas  debates,  for  example, \npeople  shouted  encouragement  to  the  speakers  (\"You  tell  'em, \nAbel\")  or  voiced  terse  expressions  of  scorn  (\"Answer  that  one, \nif you can\").  Applause  was  frequent,  usually  reserved  for  a hu-\nmorous  or  elegant  phrase  or  a  cogent  point.  At  the  first  debate \nin Ottowa,  Douglas  responded  to  lengthy  applause  with  a  re-\nmarkable  and  revealing  statement.  \"My  friends,\"  he  said,  \"si-\nlence  will  be  more  acceptable  to  me  in  the  discussion  of  these \nquestions  than  applause.  I  desire  to  address  myself  to  your  judg-\nment,  your  understanding,  and  your  consciences,  and  not  to \nyour  passions  or  your  enthusiasms.\"3  As  to  the  conscience  of \nthe audience,  or  even  its  judgment,  it  is  difficult  to  say  very \nmuch.  But  as  to  its understanding,  a  great  deal  can  be  assumed. \nFor one  thing,  its  attention  span  would  obviously  have  been \nextraordinary  by  current  standards.  Is  there  any  audience  of \nAmericans  today  who  could  endure  seven  hours  of  talk?  or \nfive? or  three?  Especially  without  pictures  of any  kind?  Second, \nthese  audiences  must  have  had  an  equally  extraordinary  capac-\nity to  comprehend  lengthy  and  complex  sentences  aurally.  In\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to Death 46 \nDouglas'  Ottowa  speech  he  included  in  his  one-hour  address \nthree  long,  legally  phrased  resolutions  of  the  Abolition  plat-\nform.  Lincoln,  in  his  reply,  read  even  longer  passages  from  a \npublished  speech  he  had  delivered  on  a  previous  occasion.  For \nall of Lincoln's  celebrated  economy  of  style,  his  sentence  struc-\nture  in  the  debates  was  intricate  and  subtle,  as  was  Douglas'.  In \nthe  second  debate,  at  Freeport,  Illinois,  Lincoln  rose  to  answer \nDouglas  in  the  following  words: \nIt will readily occur to you that I cannot,  in half an hour,  notice all \nthe things that so able a man as Judge Douglas can say in an hour \nand a  half; and I  hope,  therefore,  if there be anything that he has \nsaid upon  which  you would like to hear something from  me, but \nwhich I  omit  to  comment  upon,  you  will  bear  in  mind  that  it \nwould be  expecting an  impossibility for  me  to  cover his whole \nground.4 \nIt is hard  to  imagine  the  present  occupant  of  the  White  House \nbeing  capable  of  constructing  such  clauses  in  similar  circum-\nstances.  And  if  he  were,  he  would  surely  do  so  at  the  risk  of \nburdening  the  comprehension  or  concentration  of  his audience. \nPeople  of  a  television  culture  need  \"plain  language\"  both  au-\nrally and  visually,  and  will  even  go  so far as to require  it in some \ncircumstances  by  law.  The  Gettysburg  Address  would  probably \nhave  been  largely  incomprehensible  to  a 1985  audience. \nThe Lincoln-Douglas  audience  apparently  had  a  considerable \ngrasp  of  the  issues  being  debated,  including  knowledge  of  his-\ntorical  events  and  complex  political  matters.  At  Ottowa,  Doug-\nlas put  seven  interrogatives  to  Lincoln,  all  of which  would  have \nbeen  rhetorically  pointless  unless  the  audience  was  familiar \nwith  the  Dred  Scott  decision,  the  quarrel  between  Douglas  and \nPresident  Buchanan,  the  disaffection  of  some  Democrats,  the \nAbolition  platform,  and  Lincoln's  famous  \"House  divided\" \nspeech  at  Cooper  Union.  Further,  in  answering  Douglas'  ques-\ntions  in  a  later  debate,  Lincoln  made  a  subtle  distinction  be-\n\f\nThe Typographic Mind 47 \ntween  what  he  was,  or  was  not,  \"pledged\"  to  uphold  and  what \nhe actually  believed,  which  he  surely  would  not  have  attempted \nunless  he  assumed  the  audience  could  grasp  his  point.  Finally, \nwhile  both  speakers  employed  some  of  the  more  simple-\nminded  weapons  of argumentative  language  (e.g.,  name-calling \nand bombastic  generalities),  they  consistently  drew  upon  more \ncomplex  rhetorical  resources—sarcasm,  irony,  paradox,  elabo-\nrated metaphors,  fine  distinctions  and  the  exposure  of  contra-\ndiction,  none  of  which  would  have  advanced  their  respective \ncauses  unless  the  audience  was  fully  aware  of  the  means  being \nemployed. \nIt would  be  false,  however,  to  give  the  impression  that  these \n1858 audiences  were  models  of intellectual  propriety.  All  of the \nLincoln-Douglas  debates  were  conducted  amid  a  carnival-like \natmosphere.  Bands  played  (although  not  during  the  debates), \nhawkers  sold  their  wares,  children  romped,  liquor  was  avail-\nable. These  were  important  social  events  as  well  as  rhetorical \nperformances,  but  this  did  not  trivialize  them.  As  I  have  indi-\ncated,  these  audiences  were  made  up  of  people  whose  intellec-\ntual lives  and  public  business  were  fully  integrated  into  their \nsocial world.  As Winthrop  Hudson  has  pointed  out,  even  Meth-\nodist camp  meetings  combined  picnics  with  opportunities  to  lis-\nten to  oratory.5  Indeed,  most  of  the  camp  grounds  originally \nestablished  for  religious  inspiration—Chautauqua,  New  York; \nOcean  Grove,  New  Jersey;  Bayview,  Michigan;  Junaluska, \nNorth  Carolina—were  eventually  transformed  into  conference \ncenters,  serving  educational  and  intellectual  functions.  In  other \nwords,  the  use  of  language  as  a  means  of  complex  argument \nwas an  important,  pleasurable  and  common  form  of  discourse \nin almost  every  public  arena. \nTO understand  the  audience  to  whom  Lincoln  and  Douglas \ndirected  their  memorable  language,  we  must  remember  that \nthese  people  were  the  grandsons  and  granddaughters  of  the  En-\nlightenment  (American  version).  They  were  the  progeny  of \nFranklin,  Jefferson,  Madison  and  Tom  Paine, the  inheritors  of\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to Death 48 \nthe Empire  of  Reason,  as  Henry  Steele  Commager  has  called \neighteenth-century  America.  It  is true  that  among  their  number \nwere  frontiersmen,  some  of whom  were  barely  literate,  and  im-\nmigrants  to  whom  English  was  still  strange.  It  is  also  true  that \nby 1858,  the  photograph  and  telegraph  had  been  invented,  the \nadvance  guard  of  a new  epistemology  that  would  put  an  end  to \nthe Empire  of  Reason.  But  this  would  not  become  evident  until \nthe twentieth  century.  At  the  time  of  the  Lincoln-Douglas  de-\nbates,  America  was  in  the  middle  years  of its most  glorious  liter-\nary outpouring.  In  1858,  Edwin  Markham  was  six  years  old; \nMark  Twain  was  twenty-three;  Emily  Dickinson,  twenty-eight; \nWhitman  and  James  Russell  Lowell,  thirty-nine;  Thoreau, \nforty-one;  Melville,  forty-five;  Whittier  and  Longfellow,  fifty-\none;  Hawthorne  and  Emerson,  fifty-four  and  fifty-five;  Poe had \ndied nine  years  before. \nI choose  the  Lincoln-Douglas  debates  as  a  starting  point  for \nthis chapter  not  only  because  they  were  the  preeminent  exam-\nple of political  discourse  in  the  mid-nineteenth  century  but  also \nbecause  they  illustrate  the  power  of  typography  to  control  the \ncharacter  of  that  discourse.  Both  the  speakers  and  their  audi-\nence  were  habituated  to  a kind  of oratory  that  may  be  described \nas literary.  For  all of the  hoopla  and  socializing  surrounding  the \nevent,  the  speakers  had  little  to  offer,  and  audiences  little  to \nexpect,  but  language.  And  the  language  that  was  offered  was \nclearly  modeled  on  the  style  of  the  written  word.  To  anyone \nwho  has  read  what  Lincoln  and  Douglas  said,  this  is  obvious \nfrom  beginning  to  end.  The  debates  opened,  in  fact,  with  Doug-\nlas making  the  following  introduction,  highly  characteristic  of \neverything  that  was  said  afterward: \nLadies and Gentlemen:  I  appear  before you today for the purpose \nof discussing the  leading  political topics  which  now  agitate  the \npublic mind. By an arrangement  between  Mr. Lincoln and myself, \nwe are present here today for the purpose of having a joint discus-\nsion, as the representatives of the two great political parties of the\n\f\nThe Typographic Mind 49 \nState and Union, upon  the  principles in issue between  those  par-\nties, and  this  vast  concourse  of  people  shows  the  deep  feeling \nwhich pervades the public mind in  regard to  the questions  divid-\ning us.6 \nThis language  is pure  print.  That  the  occasion  required  it  to be \nspoken  aloud  cannot  obscure  that  fact.  And  that  the  audience \nwas able  to  process  it  through  the  ear  is  remarkable  only  to \npeople  whose  culture  no  longer  resonates  powerfully  with  the \nprinted  word.  Not  only  did  Lincoln  and  Douglas  write  all  their \nspeeches  in  advance,  but  they  also  planned  their  rebuttals  in \nwriting.  Even  the  spontaneous  interactions  between  the  speak-\ners were  expressed  in  a sentence  structure,  sentence  length  and \nrhetorical  organization  which  took  their  form  from  writing.  To \nbe sure,  there  were  elements  of  pure  orality  in  their  presenta-\ntions.  After  all, neither  speaker  was  indifferent  to the  moods  of \nthe audiences.  Nonetheless,  the  resonance  of  typography  was \never-present.  Here  was  argument  and  counterargument,  claim \nand counterclaim,  criticism  of  relevant  texts,  the  most  careful \nscrutiny  of  the  previously  uttered  sentences  of  one's  opponent. \nIn short,  the  Lincoln-Douglas  debates  may  be  described  as  ex-\npository  prose  lifted  whole  from  the  printed  page.  That  is  the \nmeaning  of  Douglas'  reproach  to  the  audience.  He  claimed  that \nhis appeal  was  to  understanding  and  not  to  passion,  as  if  the \naudience  were  to  be  silent,  reflective  readers,  and  his  language \nthe text  which  they  must  ponder.  Which  brings  us,  of course,  to \nthe questions,  What  are  the  implications  for  public  discourse  of \na written,  or  typographic,  metaphor?  What  is  the  character  of \nits content?  What  does  it  demand  of  the  public?  What  uses \nof the  mind  does  it  favor? \nOne must  begin,  I  think,  by  pointing  to  the  obvious  fact  that \nthe written  word,  and  an  oratory  based  upon  it,  has a content: a \nsemantic,  paraphrasable,  propositional  content.  This  may \nsound  odd,  but  since  I shall  be  arguing  soon  enough  that  much \nof our  discourse  today  has  only  a  marginal  propositional  con-\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to Death 50 \ntent,  I  must  stress  the  point  here.  Whenever  language  is  the \nprincipal  medium  of  communication—especially  language  con-\ntrolled  by  the  rigors  of  print—an  idea,  a  fact,  a  claim  is  the \ninevitable  result.  The  idea  may  be  banal,  the  fact  irrelevant,  the \nclaim false,  but  there  is no escape  from  meaning  when  language \nis the  instrument  guiding  one's  thought.  Though  one  may  ac-\ncomplish  it  from  time  to  time,  it  is  very  hard  to  say  nothing \nwhen  employing  a  written  English  sentence.  What  else  is  ex-\nposition  good  for?  Words  have  very  little  to  recommend  them \nexcept  as  carriers  of  meaning.  The  shapes  of  written  words  are \nnot especially  interesting  to  look  at.  Even  the  sounds  of  sen-\ntences  of  spoken  words  are  rarely  engaging  except  when  com-\nposed  by  those  with  extraordinary  poetic  gifts.  If  a  sentence \nrefuses  to  issue  forth  a  fact,  a request,  a  question,  an  assertion, \nan explanation,  it  is  nonsense,  a  mere  grammatical  shell.  As  a \nconsequence  a  language-centered  discourse  such  as  was  char-\nacteristic  of  eighteenth-  and  nineteenth-century  America  tends \nto be  both  content-laden  and  serious,  all  the  more  so  when  it \ntakes  its  form  from  print. \nIt is  serious  because  meaning  demands  to  be  understood.  A \nwritten  sentence  calls  upon  its  author  to  say  something,  upon \nits reader  to  know  the  import  of  what  is  said.  And  when  an \nauthor  and  reader  are  struggling  with  semantic  meaning,  they \nare engaged  in  the  most  serious  challenge  to  the  intellect.  This  is \nespecially  the  case  with  the  act  of  reading,  for  authors  are  not \nalways  trustworthy.  They  lie,  they  become  confused,  they  over-\ngeneralize,  they  abuse  logic  and,  sometimes,  common  sense. \nThe reader  must  come  armed,  in  a  serious  state  of  intellectual \nreadiness.  This  is not easy  because  he  comes  to  the  text  alone.  In \nreading,  one's  responses  are  isolated,  one's  intellect  thrown \nback on  its  own  resources.  To be confronted  by the  cold  abstrac-\ntions  of  printed  sentences  is  to  look  upon  language  bare,  with-\nout the  assistance  of either  beauty  or  community.  Thus,  reading \nis by its  nature  a  serious  business.  It  is also,  of course,  an  essen-\ntially rational  activity."

    "raw_text": "The Typographic Mind 51 \nFrom Erasmus  in  the  sixteenth  century  to  Elizabeth  Eisen-\nstein in  the  twentieth,  almost  every  scholar  who  has  grappled \nwith  the  question  of  what  reading  does  to  one's  habits  of  mind \nhas concluded  that  the  process  encourages  rationality;  that  the \nsequential,  propositional  character  of  the  written  word  fosters \nwhat  Walter  Ong  calls  the  \"analytic  management  of  knowl-\nedge.\"  To  engage  the  written  word  means  to  follow  a  line  of \nthought,  which  requires  considerable  powers  of  classifying, \ninference-making  and  reasoning.  It  means  to  uncover  lies,  con-\nfusions,  and  overgeneralizations,  to  detect  abuses  of  logic  and \ncommon  sense.  It  also  means  to  weigh  ideas,  to  compare  and \ncontrast  assertions,  to  connect  one  generalization  to  another.  To \naccomplish  this,  one  must  achieve  a  certain  distance  from  the \nwords  themselves,  which  is,  in  fact,  encouraged  by  the  isolated \nand impersonal  text.  That  is  why  a  good  reader  does  not  cheer \nan apt  sentence  or  pause  to  applaud  even  an  inspired  para-\ngraph.  Analytic  thought  is  too  busy  for  that,  and  too  detached. \nI do not  mean  to  imply  that  prior  to  the  written  word  analytic \nthought  was  not  possible.  I  am referring  here  not  to  the  poten-\ntialities  of  the  individual  mind  but  to  the  predispositions  of  a \ncultural  mind-set.  In  a  culture  dominated  by  print,  public  dis-\ncourse  tends  to  be characterized  by  a coherent,  orderly  arrange-\nment  of  facts  and  ideas.  The  public  for  whom  it  is  intended  is \ngenerally  competent  to  manage  such  discourse.  In  a  print  cul-\nture,  writers  make  mistakes  when  they  lie,  contradict  them-\nselves, fail  to  support  their  generalizations,  try  to  enforce \nillogical connections.  In  a  print  culture,  readers  make  mistakes \nwhen  they  don't  notice,  or  even  worse,  don't  care. \nIn the  eighteenth  and  nineteenth  centuries,  print  put  forward \na definition  of  intelligence  that  gave  priority  to  the  objective, \nrational  use  of the  mind  and  at  the  same  time  encouraged  forms \nof public  discourse  with  serious,  logically  ordered  content.  It  is \nno accident  that  the  Age  of  Reason  was  coexistent  with  the \ngrowth  of  a  print  culture,  first  in  Europe  and  then  in  America. \nThe spread  of  typography  kindled  the  hope  that  the  world  and"

It  is  in  the  eighteenth  century  that  sci-\nence—the  preeminent  example  of  the  analytic  management  of \nknowledge—begins  its  refashioning  of  the  world.  It  is  in  the \neighteenth  century  that  capitalism  is  demonstrated  to  be  a  ra-\ntional  and  liberal  system  of  economic  life,  that  religious  super-\nstition  comes  under  furious  attack,  that  the  divine  right  of kings \nis shown  to  be  a  mere  prejudice,  that  the  idea  of  continuous \nprogress  takes  hold,  and  that  the  necessity  of  universal  literacy \nthrough  education  becomes  apparent. \nPerhaps the  most  optimistic  expression  of  everything  that  ty-\npography  implied  is  contained  in  the  following  paragraph  from \nJohn  Stuart  Mill's  autobiography: \nSo complete  was  my  father's  reliance  on  the  influence  of man-\nkind, wherever  [literacy] is allowed to reach them,  that he felt as if \nall would be gained if the whole population  were  taught  to read, if \nall sorts of opinions  were allowed to be addressed to them by word \nand in  writing,  and  if, by means of the suffrage,  they  could nomi-\nnate a legislature to give effect to the opinion  they  adopted.7 \nThis was,  of  course,  a  hope  never  quite  realized.  At  no  point \nin the  history  of  England  or  America  (or  anyplace  else)  has  the \ndominion  of  reason  been  so  total  as  the  elder  Mill  imagined \ntypography  would  allow.  Nonetheless,  it  is not  difficult  to dem-\nonstrate  that  in  the  eighteenth  and  nineteenth  centuries,  Amer-\nican  public  discourse,  being  rooted  in  the  bias  of  the  printed \nword,  was  serious,  inclined  toward  rational  argument  and  pre-\nsentation,  and,  therefore,  made  up  of  meaningful  content. \nLet us  take  religious  discourse  as  an  illustration  of  this  point. \nIn the  eighteenth  century  believers  were  as  much  influenced  by \nthe  rationalist  tradition  as  anyone  else.  The  New  World  offered \nfreedom  of  religion  to  all,  which  implied  that  no  force  other \nthan  reason  itself  could  be  employed  to  bring  light  to  the  un-\nbeliever.  \"Here  Deism  will  have  its  full  chance,\"  said  Ezra  Stiles\n\f\nThe Typographic Mind 53 \nin one  of  his  famous  sermons  in  1783.  \"Nor  need  libertines \n[any]  more  to  complain  of  being  overcome  by  any  weapons  but \nthe gentle,  the  powerful  ones  of argument  and  truth.\"8 \nLeaving  aside  the  libertines,  we  know  that  the  Deists  were \ncertainly  given  their  full  chance.  It  is quite  probable,  in  fact,  that \nthe first  four  presidents  of  the  United  States  were  Deists.  Jeffer-\nson, certainly,  did  not  believe  in  the  divinity  of Jesus  Christ  and, \nwhile  he  was  President,  wrote  a  version  of  the  Four  Gospels \nfrom  which  he  removed  all  references  to  \"fantastic\"  events,  re-\ntaining  only  the  ethical  content  of Jesus'  teaching.  Legend  has  it \nthat  when  Jefferson  was  elected  President,  old  women  hid  their \nBibles and  shed  tears.  What  they  might  have  done  had  Tom \nPaine  become  President  or  been  offered  some  high  post  in  the \ngovernment  is  hard  to  imagine.  In  The  Age of  Reason, Paine  at-\ntacked  the  Bible  and  all  subsequent  Christian  theology.  Of Jesus \nChrist,  Paine  allowed  that  he  was  a  virtuous  and  amiable  man \nbut charged  that  the  stories  of his  divinity  were  absurd  and  pro-\nfane,  which,  in  the  way  of  the  rationalist,  he  tried  to  prove  by  a \nclose textual  analysis  of  the  Bible.  \"All  national  institutions  of \nchurches,\"  he  wrote,  \"whether  Jewish,  Christian  or  Turkish, \nappear  to  me  no  other  than  human  inventions,  set  up  to  terrify \nand enslave  mankind,  and  monopolize  power  and  profit.\"9  Be-\ncause  of  The  Age of  Reason, Paine  lost  his  standing  among  the \npantheon  of  Founding  Fathers  (and  to  this  day  is treated  ambig-\nuously  in  American  history  textbooks).  But  Ezra  Stiles  did  not \nsay that  libertines  and  Deists  would  be  loved: only  that  with  rea-\nson as their  jury, they  would  have  their  say  in an  open  court.  As \nindeed  they  did.  Assisted  by  the  initial  enthusiasms  evoked  by \nthe French  Revolution,  the  Deist  attack  on  churches  as  enemies \nof progress  and  on  religious  superstition  as  enemy  of  rational-\nity became  a  popular  movement.10  The  churches  fought  back, \nof course,  and  when  Deism  ceased  to  attract  interest,  they \nfought  among  themselves.  Toward  the  mid-eighteenth  century, \nTheodore  Frelinghuysen  and  William  Tennent  led  a  revivalist \nmovement  among  Presbyterians.  They  were  followed  by  the\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to Death 54 \nthree  great  figures  associated  with  religious  \"awakenings\"  in \nAmerica—Jonathan  Edwards,  George  Whitefìeld,  and,  later  in \nthe nineteenth  century,  Charles  Finney. \nThese  men  were  spectacularly  successful  preachers,  whose \nappeal  reached  regions  of  consciousness  far  beyond  where  rea-\nson rules.  Of Whitefìeld,  it was  said  that  by  merely  pronouncing \nthe word  \"Mesopotamia,\"  he  evoked  tears  in his  audience.  Per-\nhaps  that  is  why  Henry  Coswell  remarked  in  1839  that  \"reli-\ngious  mania  is  said  to  be  the  prevailing  form  of  insanity  in  the \nUnited  States.\"  11  Yet  it is essential  to  bear  in  mind  that  quarrels \nover  doctrine  between  the  revivalist  movements  of  the  eigh-\nteenth  and  nineteenth  centuries  and  the  established  churches \nfiercely opposed  to  them  were  argued  in  pamphlets  and  books \nin largely  rational,  logically  ordered  language.  It  would  be  a \nserious  mistake  to  think  of  Billy Graham  or  any  other  television \nrevivalist  as  a  latter-day  Jonathan  Edwards  or  Charles  Finney. \nEdwards  was  one  of  the  most  brilliant  and  creative  minds  ever \nproduced  by  America.  His  contribution  to  aesthetic  theory  was \nalmost  as  important  as  his  contribution  to  theology.  His  inter-\nests were  mostly  academic;  he  spent  long  hours  each  day  in  his \nstudy.  He  did  not  speak  to  his  audiences  extemporaneously.  He \nread his  sermons,  which  were  tightly  knit  and  closely  reasoned \nexpositions  of  theological  doctrine.12  Audiences  may  have  been \nmoved  emotionally  by  Edwards'  language,  but  they  were,  first \nand foremost,  required  to  understand  it.  Indeed  Edwards'  fame \nwas largely  a  result  of  a book,  Faithful  Narrative  of  the Surprising \nWork of  God  in the  Conversion  of  Many Hundred  Souls  in  North-\nampton, published  in  1737.  A  later  book,  A  Treatise  Concern-\ning Religious  Affections, published  in  1746,  is  considered  to  be \namong  the  most  remarkable  psychological  studies  ever  pro-\nduced  in  America. \nUnlike  the  principal  figures  in  today's  \"great  awakening\"— \nOral Roberts,  Jerry  Falwell,  Jimmy  Swaggart,  et  al.—yester-\nday's  leaders  of  revivalist  movements  in  America  were  men  of \nlearning,  faith  in  reason,  and  generous  expository  gifts.  Their\n\f\nThe Typographic Mind 55 \ndisputes  with  the  religious  establishments  were  as  much  about \ntheology  and  the  nature  of  consciousness  as  they  were  about \nreligious  inspiration.  Finney,  for  example,  was  no  \"backcountry \nrustic,\"  as  he  was  sometimes  characterized  by  his  doctrinal  op-\nponents.13  He  had  been  trained  as  a lawyer,  wrote  an  important \nbook  on  systematic  theology,  and  ended  his  career  as  a  pro-\nfessor  at and  then  president  of  Oberlin  College. \nThe doctrinal  disputes  among  religionists  not  only  were  ar-\ngued  in  carefully  drawn  exposition  in  the  eighteenth  century, \nbut in  the  nineteenth  century  were  settled  by  the  extraordinary \nexpedient  of  founding  colleges.  It  is  sometimes  forgotten  that \nthe churches  in  America  laid  the  foundation  of  our  system  of \nhigher  education.  Harvard,  of  course,  was  established  early—in \n1636—for  the  purpose  of  providing  learned  ministers  to  the \nCongregational  Church.  And,  sixty-five  years  later,  when  Con-\ngregationalists  quarreled  among  themselves  over  doctrine,  Yale \nCollege  was  founded  to  correct  the  lax  influences  of  Harvard \n(and,  to  this  day,  claims  it  has  the  same  burden).  The  strong \nintellectual  strain  of  the  Congregationalists  was  matched  by \nother  denominations,  certainly  in  their  passion  for  starting  col-\nleges. The  Presbyterians  founded,  among  other  schools,  the \nUniversity  of  Tennessee  in  1784,  Washington  and  Jefferson \nin 1802  and  Lafayette  in  1826.  The  Baptists  founded,  among \nothers,  Colgate  (1817),  George  Washington  (1821),  Furman \n(1826),  Denison  (1832)  and  Wake  Forest  (1834).  The  Episco-\npalians  founded  Hobart  (1822),  Trinity  (1823)  and  Kenyon \n(1824).  The  Methodists  founded  eight  colleges  between  1830 \nand 1851,  including  Wesleyan,  Emory,  and  Depauw.  In  addi-\ntion  to  Harvard  and  Yale,  the  Congregationalists  founded  Wil-\nliams  (1793),  Middlebury  (1800),  Amherst  (1821)  and  Oberlin \n(1833). \nIf this  preoccupation  with  literacy  and  learning  be  a  \"form  of \ninsanity,\"  as  Coswell  said  of  religious  life  in  America,  then  let \nthere  be  more  of  it.  In  the  eighteenth  and  nineteenth  centuries, \nreligious  thought  and  institutions  in  America  were  dominated\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to Death 56 \nby an  austere,  learned,  and  intellectual  form  of discourse  that  is \nlargely  absent  from  religious  life  today.  No  clearer  example  of \nthe  difference  between  earlier  and  modern  forms  of public  dis-\ncourse  can  be  found  than  in  the  contrast  between  the  theologi-\ncal arguments  of  Jonathan  Edwards  and  those  of,  say,  Jerry \nFalwell,  or  Billy  Graham,  or  Oral  Roberts.  The  formidable  con-\ntent  to  Edwards'  theology  must  inevitably  engage  the  intellect; \nif there  is  such  a  content  to  the  theology  of  the  television  evan-\ngelicals,  they  have  not  yet  made  it  known. \nThe differences  between  the  character  of  discourse  in  a print-\nbased  culture  and  the  character  of  discourse  in  a  television-\nbased  culture  are  also  evident  if  one  looks  at  the  legal  system. \nIn a  print-based  culture,  lawyers  tended  to  be  well  educated, \ndevoted  to  reason,  and  capable  of  impressive  expositional  argu-\nment.  It  is  a matter  frequently  overlooked  in  histories  of  Amer-\nica that  in  the  eighteenth  and  nineteenth  centuries,  the  legal \nprofession  represented  \"a  sort  of  privileged  body  in  the  scale  of \nintellect,\"  as  Tocqueville  remarked.  Folk  heroes  were  made  of \nsome  of  those  lawyers,  like  Sergeant  Prentiss of  Alabama,  or \n\"Honest\"  Abe  Lincoln  of  Illinois,  whose  craftiness  in  manip-\nulating  juries  was  highly  theatrical,  not  unlike  television's \nversion  of  a trial  lawyer.  But  the  great  figures  of  American  juris-\nprudence—John  Marshall,  Joseph  Story,  James  Kent,  David \nHoffman,  William  Wirt  and  Daniel  Webster—were  models  of \nintellectual  elegance  and  devotion  to  rationality  and  scholar-\nship.  They  believed  that  democracy,  for  all of its obvious  virtues, \nposed  the  danger  of  releasing  an  undisciplined  individualism. \nTheir  aspiration  was  to  save  civilization  in  America  by  \"creating \na rationality  for  the  law.\"14  As  a  consequence  of  this  exalted \nview,  they  believed  that  law  must  not  be  merely  a  learned  pro-\nfession  but  a  liberal  one.  The  famous  law  professor  Job  Tyson \nargued  that  a  lawyer  must  be  familiar  with  the  works  of  Seneca, \nCicero,  and  Plato.15  George  Sharswood,  perhaps  envisioning \nthe  degraded  state  of  legal  education  in  the  twentieth  century, \nremarked  in  1854  that  to  read  law  exclusively  will  damage  the\n\f\nThe Typographic Mind 57 \nmind,  \"shackle  it  to the  technicalities  with  which  it  has  become \nso familiar,  and  disable  it from  taking  enlarged  and  comprehen-\nsive views  even  of  topics  falling  within  its  compass.\"16 \nThe insistence  on  a  liberal,  rational  and  articulate  legal  mind \nwas reinforced  by  the  fact  that  America  had  a  written  constitu-\ntion,  as  did  all  of  its  component  states,  and  that  law  did  not \ngrow  by chance  but  was  explicitly  formulated.  A lawyer  needed \nto be  a  writing  and  reading  man  par  excellence,  for  reason  was \nthe principal  authority  upon  which  legal  questions  were  to  be \ndecided.  John  Marshall  was,  of  course,  the  great  \"paragon  of \nreason,  as  vivid  a  symbol  to  the  American  imagination  as  Natty \nBumppo.\"17  He  was  the  preeminent  example  of  Typographic \nMan—detached,  analytical,  devoted  to  logic,  abhorring  contra-\ndiction.  It  was  said  of  him  that  he  never  used  analogy  as  a prin-\ncipal support  of  his  arguments.  Rather,  he  introduced  most  of \nhis decisions  with  the  phrase  \"It  is  admitted.  .  .  .\"  Once  one \nadmitted  his  premises,  one  was  usually  forced  to accept  his  con-\nclusion. \nTo an  extent  difficult  to  imagine  today,  earlier  Americans \nwere  familiar  not  only  with  the  great  legal  issues  of  their  time \nbut even  with  the  language  famous  lawyers  had  used  to  argue \ntheir  cases.  This  was  especially  true  of  Daniel  Webster,  and  it \nwas only  natural  that  Stephen  Vincent  Benét  in  his  famous \nshort  story  would  have  chosen  Daniel  Webster  to  contend  with \nthe Devil.  How  could  the  Devil  triumph  over  a man  whose  lan-\nguage,  described  by  Supreme  Court  Justice  Joseph  Story,  had \nthe following  characteristics? \n...  his  clearness and  downright  simplicity of statement,  his  vast \ncomprehensiveness of  topics,  his  fertility  in  illustrations  drawn \nfrom practical sources; his  keen analysis, and  suggestion of diffi-\nculties; his power of disentangling a complicated proposition,  and \nresolving it  in  elements  so  plain  as  to  reach  the  most  common \nminds; his  vigor in  generalizations, planting  his  own  arguments \nbehind the  whole battery of his opponents;  his wariness and cau-"

    "raw_text": "Amusing Ourselves  to Death 58 \ntion not  to  betray himself by heat into  untenable  positions, or  to \nspread his forces over useless ground.18 \nI quote  this  in  full  because  it  is  the  best  nineteenth-century \ndescription  I  know  of  the  character  of discourse  expected  of one \nwhose  mind  is  formed  by  the  printed  word.  It  is  exactly  the \nideal and  model  James  Mill  had  in  mind  in  prophesying  about \nthe  wonders  of  typography.  And  if  the  model  was  somewhat \nunreachable,  it  stood  nonetheless  as  an  ideal  to  which  every \nlawyer  aspired. \nSuch an  ideal  went  far  beyond  the  legal  profession  or  the \nministry  in  its  influence.  Even  in  the  everyday  world  of  com-\nmerce,  the  resonances  of  rational,  typographic  discourse  were \nto be  found.  If we  may  take  advertising  to  be  the  voice  of  com-\nmerce,  then  its  history  tells  very  clearly  that  in  the  eighteenth \nand nineteenth  centuries  those  with  products  to  sell  took  their \ncustomers  to  be  not  unlike  Daniel  Webster:  they  assumed  that \npotential  buyers  were  literate,  rational,  analytical.  Indeed,  the \nhistory  of newspaper  advertising  in America  may  be  considered, \nall by  itself,  as  a  metaphor  of  the  descent  of  the  typographic \nmind,  beginning,  as  it does,  with  reason,  and  ending,  as  it does, \nwith  entertainment.  In  Frank  Presbrey's classic  study  The  History \nand Development of Advertising, he  discusses  the  decline  of typog-\nraphy,  dating  its  demise  in  the  late  1860's  and  early  1870's.  He \nrefers  to the  period  before  then  as  the  \"dark  ages\"  of typograph-\nical display.19  The  dark  ages  to  which  he  refers  began  in  1704 \nwhen  the  first  paid  advertisements  appeared  in  an  American \nnewspaper,  The  Boston News-Letter. These  were  three  in number, \noccupying  altogether  four  inches  of  single-column  space.  One \nof them  offered  a reward  for  the  capture  of  a  thief;  another  of-\nfered  a reward  for  the  return  of  an  anvil  that  was  \"taken  up\"  by \nsome  unknown  party.  The  third  actually  offered  something  for \nsale, and,  in  fact,  is  not  unlike  real  estate  advertisements  one \nmight  see  in  today's  New  York  Times:\n\f\nThe Typographic Mind 59 \nAt Oysterbay, on Long Island in the Province of N. York. There is a \nvery good  Fulling-Mill,  to  be  Let or  Sold,  as  also  a  Plantation, \nhaving on it a large new Brick house,  and another  good house  by \nit for  a Kitchen  &  workhouse,  with  a  Barn,  Stable  &c. a young \nOrchard and  20  acres  clear  land.  The  Mill  is  to  be  Let with  or \nwithout the  Plantation;  Enquire  of Mr. William Bradford Printer in \nN. York, and know  further.20 \nFor more  than  a  century  and  a  half  afterward,  advertisements \ntook  this  form  with  minor  alterations.  For  example,  sixty-four \nyears  after  Mr.  Bradford  advertised  an  estate  in  Oyster  Bay,  the \nlegendary  Paul  Revere  placed  the  following  advertisement  in \nthe Boston  Gazette: \nWhereas many  persons  are  só  unfortunate  as to  lose  their  Fore-\nTeeth by  Accident, and  otherways,  to  their  great  Detriment,  not \nonly in Looks, but Speaking both in Public and Private:—This is to \ninform all  such,  that  they  may  have  them  re-placed  with  false \nOnes, that  look  as  well as  the  Natural,  and  Answers  the  End  of \nSpeaking to all Intents,  by PAUL REVERE, Goldsmith, near  the Head \nof Dr. Clarke's Wharf, Boston.21 \nRevere  went  on  to  explain  in  another  paragraph  that  those \nwhose  false  teeth  had  been  fitted  by  John  Baker,  and  who  had \nsuffered  the  indignity  of  having  them  loosen,  might  come  to \nRevere  to  have  them  tightened.  He  indicated  that  he  had \nlearned  how  to  do  this  from  John  Baker  himself. \nNot until  almost  a  hundred  years  after  Revere's  announce-\nment  were  there  any  serious  attempts  by  advertisers  to  over-\ncome  the  lineal,  typographic  form  demanded  by  publishers.22 \nAnd not  until  the  end  of  the  nineteenth  century  did  advertising \nmove  fully  into  its  modern  mode  of  discourse.  As  late  as  1890, \nadvertising,  still  understood  to  consist  of  words,  was  regarded \nas an  essentially  serious  and  rational  enterprise  whose  purpose \nwas to  convey  information  and  make  claims  in  propositional\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to Death 60 \nform.  Advertising  was,  as  Stephen  Douglas  said  in  another  con-\ntext,  intended  to  appeal  to  understanding,  not  to  passions.  This \nis not  to  say  that  during  the  period  of  typographic  display,  the \nclaims  that  were  put  forward  were  true.  Words  cannot  guaran-\ntee their  truth  content.  Rather,  they  assemble  a  context  in \nwhich  the  question,  Is  this  true  or  false?  is  relevant.  In  the \n1890's  that  context  was  shattered,  first  by  the  massive  intrusion \nof illustrations  and  photographs,  then  by  the  nonpropositional \nuse of  language.  For  example,  in  the  1890's  advertisers  adopted \nthe  technique  of  using  slogans.  Presbrey contends  that  modern \nadvertising  can  be  said  to  begin  with  the  use  of  two  such  slo-\ngans:  \"You  press  the  button;  we  do  the  rest\"  and  \"See  that \nhump?\"  At  about  the  same  time,  jingles  started  to  be  used,  and \nin 1892,  Procter  and  Gamble  invited  the  public  to  submit \nrhymes  to  advertise  Ivory  Soap.  In  1896,  H-O  employed,  for  the \nfirst time,  a  picture  of  a baby  in  a  high  chair,  the  bowl  of  cereal \nbefore  him,  his  spoon  in  hand,  his  face  ecstatic.  By  the  turn  of \nthe  century,  advertisers  no  longer  assumed  rationality  on  the \npart  of  their  potential  customers.  Advertising  became  one  part \ndepth  psychology,  one  part  aesthetic  theory.  Reason  had  to \nmove  itself  to  other  arenas. \nTo understand  the  role  that  the  printed  word  played  in  pro-\nviding  an  earlier  America  with  its  assumptions  about  intelli-\ngence,  truth  and  the  nature  of  discourse,  one  must  keep  in  view \nthat  the  act  of  reading  in  the  eighteenth  and  nineteenth  cen-\nturies  had  an  entirely  different  quality  to  it  than  the  act  of read-\ning does  today.  For  one  thing,  as  I  have  said,  the  printed  word \nhad  a  monopoly  on  both  attention  and  intellect,  there  being  no \nother  means,  besides  the  oral  tradition,  to  have  access  to  public \nknowledge.  Public figures  were  known  largely  by  their  written \nwords,  for  example,  not  by  their  looks  or  even  their  oratory.  It  is \nquite  likely  that  most  of  the  first  fifteen  presidents  of  the  United \nStates  would  not  have  been  recognized  had  they  passed  the \naverage  citizen  in  the  street.  This  would  have  been  the  case  as \nwell  of  the  great  lawyers,  ministers  and  scientists  of that  era.  To\n\f\nThe Typographic Mind 61 \nthink  about  those  men  was  to  think  about  what  they  had  writ-\nten,  to  judge  them  by  their  public  positions,  their  arguments, \ntheir  knowledge  as  codified  in  the  printed  word.  You  may  get \nsome  sense  of  how  we  are  separated  from  this  kind  of  con-\nsciousness  by  thinking  about  any  of  our  recent  presidents;  or \neven  preachers,  lawyers  and  scientists  who  are  or  who  have \nrecently  been  public  figures.  Think  of  Richard  Nixon  or  Jimmy \nCarter  or  Billy  Graham,  or  even  Albert  Einstein,  and  what  will \ncome  to  your  mind  is  an image,  a picture  of a face,  most  likely  a \nface on a  television  screen  (in  Einstein's  case,  a photograph  of  a \nface).  Of words,  almost  nothing  will  come  to  mind.  This  is  the \ndifference  between  thinking  in  a  word-centered  culture  and \nthinking  in  an  image-centered  culture. \nIt is  also  the  difference  between  living  in  a  culture  that  pro-\nvides little  opportunity  for  leisure,  and  one  that  provides  much. \nThe farm  boy  following  the  plow  with  book  in  hand,  the \nmother  reading  aloud  to  her  family  on  a  Sunday  afternoon,  the \nmerchant  reading  announcements  of  the  latest  clipper  arrivals \n—these  were  different  kinds  of  readers  from  those  of  today. \nThere  would  have  been  little  casual  reading,  for  there  was  not  a \ngreat deal  of  time  for  that.  Reading  would  have  had  a  sacred \nelement  in  it,  or  if  not  that,  would  have  at  least  occurred  as  a \ndaily or  weekly  ritual  invested  with  special  meaning.  For  we \nmust  also  remember  that  this  was  a  culture  without  electricity. \nIt would  not  have  been  easy  to  read  by  either  candlelight  or, \nlater,  gaslight.  Doubtless,  much  reading  was  done  between \ndawn  and  the  start  of  the  day's  business.  What  reading  would \nhave  been  done  was  done  seriously,  intensely,  and  with  stead-\nfast purpose.  The  modern  idea  of  testing  a  reader's  \"compre-\nhension,\"  as  distinct  from  something  else  a  reader  may  be \ndoing,  would  have  seemed  an  absurdity  in  1790  or  1830  or \n1860. What  else  was  reading  but  comprehending?  As  far  as we \nknow,  there  did  not  exist  such  a  thing  as  a \"reading  problem,\" \nexcept,  of  course,  for  those  who  could  not  attend  school.  To \nattend  school  meant  to  learn  to  read,  for  without  that  capacity,\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to Death 62 \none  could  not  participate  in  the  culture's  conversations.  But \nmost  people  could  read  and  did  participate.  To  these  people, \nreading  was  both  their  connection  to  and  their  model  of  the \nworld.  The  printed  page  revealed  the  world,  line  by  line,  page \nby page,  to  be  a  serious,  coherent  place,  capable  of  manage-\nment  by  reason,  and  of  improvement  by  logical  and  relevant \ncriticism. \nAlmost  anywhere  one  looks  in  the  eighteenth  and  nineteenth \ncenturies,  then,  one  finds  the  resonances  of  the  printed  word \nand,  in  particular,  its  inextricable  relationship  to  all  forms  of \npublic  expression.  It  may  be  true,  as  Charles  Beard  wrote,  that \nthe primary  motivation  of  the  writers  of the  United  States  Con-\nstitution  was  the  protection  of  their  economic  interests.  But  it is \nalso true  that  they  assumed  that  participation  in  public  life  re-\nquired  the  capacity  to  negotiate  the  printed  word.  To them,  ma-\nture  citizenship  was  not  conceivable  without  sophisticated \nliteracy,  which  is  why  the  voting  age  in  most  states  was  set  at \ntwenty-one,  and  why  Jefferson  saw  in  universal  education \nAmerica's  best  hope.  And  that  is  also  why,  as  Allan  Nevins  and \nHenry  Steele  Commager  have  pointed  out,  the  voting  restric-\ntions  against  those  who  owned  no  property  were  frequently \noverlooked,  but  not  one's  inability  to  read. \nIt may  be  true,  as  Frederick  Jackson  Turner  wrote,  that  the \nspirit that  fired  the  American  mind  was  the  fact  of  an  ever-\nexpanding  frontier.  But  it  is  also  true,  as  Paul Anderson  has \nwritten,  that  \"it  is no mere  figure  of  speech  to  say that  farm  boys \nfollowed  the  plow  with  book  in  hand,  be  it Shakespeare,  Emer-\nson,  or  Thoreau.\"23  For  it was  not  only  a frontier  mentality  that \nled Kansas  to  be  the  first  state  to  permit  women  to  vote  in \nschool  elections,  or  Wyoming  the  first  state  to  grant  complete \nequality  in  the  franchise.  Women  were  probably  more  adept \nreaders  than  men,  and  even  in  the  frontier  states  the  principal \nmeans  of  public  discourse  issued  from  the  printed  word.  Those \nwho  could  read  had,  inevitably,  to  become  part  of  the  conver-\nsation.\n\f\nThe Typographic Mind 63 \nIt may  also  be  true,  as  Perry Miller  has  suggested,  that  the \nreligious  fervor  of Americans  provided  much  of  their  energy;  or, \nas earlier  historians  told  it,  that  America  was  created  by  an  idea \nwhose  time  had  come.  I  quarrel  with  none  of  these  explana-\ntions.  I merely  observe  that  the  America  they  try  to  explain  was \ndominated  by  a  public  discourse  which  took  its  form  from  the \nproducts  of  the  printing  press.  For  two  centuries,  America  de-\nclared  its  intentions,  expressed  its  ideology,  designed  its  laws, \nsold its  products,  created  its  literature  and  addressed  its  deities \nwith  black  squiggles  on  white  paper.  It  did  its  talking  in  typog-\nraphy,  and  with  that  as  the  main  feature  of  its  symbolic  envi-\nronment  rose  to  prominence  in  world  civilization. \nThe name  I  give  to  that  period  of  time  during  which  the \nAmerican  mind  submitted  itself  to  the  sovereignty  of  the  print-\ning press  is  the  Age  of  Exposition.  Exposition  is  a  mode  of \nthought,  a  method  of  learning,  and  a  means  of  expression.  Al-\nmost  all  of  the  characteristics  we  associate  with  mature  dis-\ncourse  were  amplified  by  typography,  which  has  the  strongest \npossible  bias  toward  exposition:  a  sophisticated  ability  to  think \nconceptually,  deductively  and  sequentially;  a  high  valuation  of \nreason  and  order;  an  abhorrence  of  contradiction;  a  large  ca-\npacity for  detachment  and  objectivity;  and  a  tolerance  for  de-\nlayed response.  Toward  the  end  of  the  nineteenth  century,  for \nreasons  I  am  most  anxious  to  explain,  the  Age  of  Exposition \nbegan  to  pass,  and  the  early  signs  of  its  replacement  could  be \ndiscerned.  Its  replacement  was  to  be  the  Age  of Show  Business.\n\f\nToward the  middle  years  of the  nineteenth  century,  two  ideas \ncame together  whose  convergence  provided  twentieth-century \nAmerica with  a  new  metaphor  of  public  discourse.  Their  part-\nnership  overwhelmed  the  Age of Exposition,  and  laid the  foun-\ndation  for  the Age of Show Business. One of the ideas was quite \nnew, the  other  as old as the cave paintings  of Altamira. We shall \ncome to the old idea presently.  The new idea was that transpor-\ntation  and  communication  could  be  disengaged  from  each \nother,  that  space  was  not an  inevitable  constraint  on  the  move-\nment of information. \nAmericans  of the 1800's  were  very much  concerned  with  the \nproblem  of  \"conquering\"  space.  By  the  mid-nineteenth  cen-\ntury, the  frontier  extended  to  the Pacific Ocean, and a rudimen-\ntary railroad  system,  begun  in  the  1830's,  had  started  to  move \npeople and  merchandise  across  the  continent.  But  until  the \n1840's, information  could  move  only  as  fast as a human  being \ncould carry  it; to  be precise,  only  as fast as a train  could  travel, \nwhich,  to  be  even  more  precise,  meant  about  thirty-five  miles \nper hour.  In  the  face  of such  a  limitation,  the  development  of \nAmerica as  a national  community  was  retarded.  In  the  1840's, \nAmerica was  still a composite  of regions,  each  conversing  in its \nown ways,  addressing  its  own  interests.  A  continentwide  con-\nversation  was  not  yet possible. \nThe solution  to  these  problems,  as  every school child used  to \nknow,  was  electricity.  To no one's  surprise,  it was an American \nwho found  a  practical  way  to  put  electricity  in  the  service  of \n64 \nThe Peek-a-Boo World \n5."

    "raw_text": "The Peek-a-Boo World 65 \ncommunication  and,  in  doing  so,  eliminated  the  problem  of \nspace  once  and  for  all.  I  refer,  of  course,  to  Samuel  Finley \nBreese  Morse,  America's  first  true  \"spaceman.\"  His  telegraph \nerased  state  lines,  collapsed  regions,  and,  by  wrapping  the  con-\ntinent  in  an  information  grid,  created  the  possibility  of  a unified \nAmerican  discourse. \nBut at  a  considerable  cost.  For  telegraphy  did  something  that \nMorse  did  not  foresee  when  he  prophesied  that  telegraphy \nwould  make  \"one  neighborhood  of  the  whole  country.\"  It  de-\nstroyed  the  prevailing  definition  of information,  and  in  doing  so \ngave a  new  meaning  to  public  discourse.  Among  the  few  who \nunderstood  this  consequence  was  Henry  David  Thoreau,  who \nremarked  in  Walden  that  \"We  are  in  great  haste  to  construct  a \nmagnetic  telegraph  from  Maine  to  Texas;  but  Maine  and  Texas, \nit may  be,  have  nothing  important  to  communicate.  .  . . We are \neager  to  tunnel  under  the  Atlantic  and  bring  the  old  world  some \nweeks  nearer  to  the  new;  but  perchance  the  first  news  that  will \nleak through  into  the  broad  flapping  American  ear  will  be  that \nPrincess Adelaide  has  the  whooping  cough.\"1 \nThoreau,  as  it  turned  out,  was  precisely  correct.  He  grasped \nthat  the  telegraph  would  create  its  own  definition  of  discourse; \nthat  it  would  not  only  permit  but  insist  upon  a  conversation \nbetween  Maine  and  Texas;  and  that  it  would  require  the  con-\ntent  of  that  conversation  to  be  different  from  what  Typographic \nMan  was  accustomed  to. \nThe telegraph  made  a  three-pronged  attack  on  typography's \ndefinition  of discourse,  introducing  on  a  large  scale  irrelevance, \nimpotence,  and  incoherence.  These  demons  of  discourse  were \naroused  by  the  fact  that  telegraphy  gave  a  form  of legitimacy  to \nthe idea  of  context-free  information;  that  is,  to  the  idea  that  the \nvalue  of  information  need  not  be  tied  to  any  function  it  might \nserve  in  social  and  political  decision-making  and  action,  but \nmay attach  merely  to  its  novelty,  interest,  and  curiosity.  The \ntelegraph  made  information  into  a  commodity,  a  \"thing\"  that \ncould  be  bought  and  sold  irrespective  of  its  uses  or  meaning.\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to Death 66 \nBut it  did  not  do  so  alone.  The  potential  of  the  telegraph  to \ntransform  information  into  a  commodity  might  never  have \nbeen  realized,  except  for  the  partnership  between  the  telegraph \nand the  press.  The  penny  newspaper,  emerging  slightly  before \ntelegraphy,  in  the  1830's,  had  already  begun  the  process  of ele-\nvating  irrelevance  to  the  status  of  news.  Such  papers  as  Ben-\njamin  Day's  New York  Sun and  James  Bennett's  New York  Herald \nturned  away  from  the  tradition  of  news  as  reasoned  (if  biased) \npolitical  opinion  and  urgent  commercial  information  and  filled \ntheir  pages  with  accounts  of  sensational  events,  mostly  con-\ncerning  crime  and  sex.  While  such  \"human  interest  news\" \nplayed  little  role  in shaping  the  decisions  and  actions  of readers, \nit was  at  least  local—about  places  and  people  within  their  expe-\nrience—and  it  was  not  always  tied  to  the  moment.  The  human-\ninterest  stories  of the  penny  newspapers  had  a  timeless  quality; \ntheir  power  to  engage  lay  not  so  much  in  their  currency  as  in \ntheir  transcendence.  Nor  did  all  newspapers  occupy  themselves \nwith  such  content.  For  the  most  part,  the  information  they  pro-\nvided  was  not  only  local  but  largely  functional—tied  to  the \nproblems  and  decisions  readers  had  to  address  in  order  to  man-\nage their  personal  and  community  affairs. \nThe telegraph  changed  all  that,  and  with  astonishing  speed. \nWithin  months  of  Morse's  first  public  demonstration,  the  local \nand the  timeless  had  lost  their  central  position  in  newspapers, \neclipsed  by  the  dazzle  of  distance  and  speed.  In  fact,  the  first \nknown  use  of  the  telegraph  by  a  newspaper  occurred  one  day \nafter  Morse  gave  his  historic  demonstration  of  telegraphy's \nworkability.  Using  the  same  Washington-to-Baltimore  line \nMorse  had  constructed,  the  Baltimore Patriot  gave its  readers  in-\nformation  about  action  taken  by  the  House  of  Representatives \non the  Oregon  issue.  The  paper  concluded  its  report  by  noting: \n\". .  .  we  are  thus  enabled  to  give  our  readers  information  from \nWashington  up  to  two  o'clock.  This  is  indeed  the  annihilation \nof space.\"2 \nFor a  brief  time,  practical  problems  (mostly  involving  the\n\f\nThe Peek-a-Boo World 67 \nscarcity of  telegraph  lines)  preserved  something  of  the  old  defi-\nnition  of  news  as  functional  information.  But  the  foresighted \namong  the  nation's  publishers  were  quick  to  see  where  the  fu-\nture  lay,  and  committed  their  full  resources  to  the  wiring  of  the \ncontinent.  William  Swain,  the  owner  of  the  Philadelphia  Public \nLedger, not  only  invested  heavily  in  the  Magnetic  Telegraph \nCompany,  the  first  commercial  telegraph  corporation,  but  be-\ncame  its  president  in  1850. \nIt was  not  long  until  the  fortunes  of newspapers  came  to  de-\npend  not  on  the  quality  or  utility  of the  news  they  provided,  but \non how  much,  from  what  distances,  and  at  what  speed.  James \nBennett  of  the  New  York  Herald boasted  that  in  the  first  week  of \n1848, his  paper  contained  79,000  words  of  telegraphic  con-\ntent3—of  what  relevance  to  his  readers,  he  didn't  say.  Only \nfour  years  after  Morse  opened  the  nation's  first  telegraph  line \non May  24,  1844,  the  Associated  Press  was  founded,  and  news \nfrom  nowhere,  addressed  to  no  one  in  particular,  began  to  criss-\ncross the  nation.  Wars,  crimes,  crashes,  fires, floods—much  of it \nthe social  and  political  equivalent  of  Adelaide's  whooping \ncough—became  the  content  of  what  people  called  \"the  news  of \nthe day.\" \nAs Thoreau  implied,  telegraphy  made  relevance  irrelevant. \nThe abundant  flow  of information  had  very  little  or  nothing  to \ndo with  those  to  whom  it  was  addressed;  that  is, with  any  social \nor intellectual  context  in  which  their  lives  were  embedded. \nColeridge's  famous  line  about  water  everywhere  without  a  drop \nto drink  may  serve  as  a  metaphor  of  a  decontextualized  infor-\nmation  environment:  In  a  sea  of  information,  there  was  very \nlittle of  it  to  use.  A  man  in  Maine  and  a  man  in  Texas  could \nconverse,  but  not  about  anything  either  of  them  knew  or  cared \nvery much  about.  The  telegraph  may  have  made  the  country \ninto  \"one  neighborhood,\"  but  it  was  a  peculiar  one,  populated \nby strangers  who  knew  nothing  but  the  most  superficial  facts \nabout  each  other. \nSince we  live  today  in  just  such  a  neighborhood  (now  some-\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to Death 68 \ntimes  called  a  \"global  village\"),  you  may  get  a  sense  of what  is \nmeant  by  context-free  information  by  asking  yourself  the  fol-\nlowing  question:  How  often  does  it  occur  that  information  pro-\nvided  you  on  morning  radio  or  television,  or  in  the  morning \nnewspaper,  causes  you  to  alter  your  plans  for  the  day,  or  to take \nsome  action  you  would  not  otherwise  have  taken,  or  provides \ninsight  into  some  problem  you  are  required  to  solve?  For  most \nof us,  news  of  the  weather  will  sometimes  have  such  conse-\nquences;  for  investors,  news  of  the  stock  market;  perhaps  an \noccasional  story  about  a  crime  will  do  it,  if by chance  the  crime \noccurred  near  where  you  live  or  involved  someone  you  know. \nBut most  of  our  daily  news  is  inert,  consisting  of  information \nthat  gives  us  something  to  talk  about  but  cannot  lead  to  any \nmeaningful  action.  This  fact  is  the  principal  legacy  of  the  tele-\ngraph:  By  generating  an  abundance  of irrelevant  information,  it \ndramatically  altered  what  may  be  called  the  \"information-\naction  ratio.\" \nIn both  oral  and  typographic  cultures,  information  derives  its \nimportance  from  the  possibilities  of  action.  Of  course,  in  any \ncommunication  environment,  input  (what  one  is  informed \nabout)  always  exceeds  output  (the  possibilities  of  action  based \non information).  But  the  situation  created  by  telegraphy,  and \nthen  exacerbated  by  later  technologies,  made  the  relationship \nbetween  information  and  action  both  abstract  and  remote.  For \nthe  first  time  in  human  history,  people  were  faced  with  the \nproblem  of  information  glut,  which  means  that  simultaneously \nthey  were  faced  with  the  problem  of  a  diminished  social  and \npolitical  potency. \nYou may  get  a  sense  of  what  this  means  by  asking  yourself \nanother  series  of  questions:  What  steps  do  you  plan  to  take  to \nreduce  the  conflict  in  the  Middle  East?  Or  the  rates  of inflation, \ncrime  and  unemployment?  What  are  your  plans  for  preserving \nthe  environment  or  reducing  the  risk  of  nuclear  war?  What  do \nyou plan  to  do  about  NATO,  OPEC, the  CIA,  affirmative  action, \nand the  monstrous  treatment  of  the  Baha'is  in  Iran?  I  shall  take\n\f\nThe Peek-a-Boo World 69 \nthe liberty  of  answering  for  you:  You  plan  to  do  nothing  about \nthem.  You may,  of course,  cast  a ballot  for  someone  who  claims \nto have  some  plans,  as well  as  the  power  to  act.  But  this  you  can \ndo only  once  every  two  or  four  years  by giving  one  hour  of  your \ntime,  hardly  a  satisfying  means  of expressing  the  broad  range  of \nopinions  you  hold.  Voting,  we  might  even  say,  is the  next  to  last \nrefuge  of the  politically  impotent.  The  last  refuge  is,  of  course, \ngiving your  opinion  to  a  pollster,  who  will  get  a  version  of  it \nthrough  a  desiccated  question,  and  then  will  submerge  it  in  a \nNiagara  of  similar  opinions,  and  convert  them  into—what \nelse?—another  piece  of news.  Thus,  we  have  here  a  great  loop \nof impotence:  The  news  elicits  from  you  a  variety  of  opinions \nabout  which  you  can  do  nothing  except  to  offer  them  as  more \nnews,  about  which  you  can  do  nothing. \nPrior to  the  age  of  telegraphy,  the  information-action  ratio \nwas sufficiently  close  so  that  most  people  had  a  sense  of  being \nable to  control  some  of  the  contingencies  in  their  lives.  What \npeople  knew  about  had  action-value.  In  the  information  world \ncreated  by  telegraphy,  this  sense  of  potency  was  lost,  precisely \nbecause  the  whole  world  became  the  context  for  news.  Every-\nthing  became  everyone's  business.  For  the  first  time,  we  were \nsent information  which  answered  no  question  we  had  asked, \nand which,  in  any  case,  did  not  permit  the  right  of  reply. \nWe may  say  then  that  the  contribution  of  the  telegraph  to \npublic  discourse  was  to  dignify  irrelevance  and  amplify  impo-\ntence.  But  this  was  not  all:  Telegraphy  also  made  public  dis-\ncourse  essentially  incoherent.  It  brought  into  being  a  world  of \nbroken  time  and  broken  attention,  to  use  Lewis  Mumford's \nphrase.  The  principal  strength  of  the  telegraph  was  its  capacity \nto move  information,  not  collect  it,  explain  it  or  analyze  it.  In \nthis respect,  telegraphy  was  the  exact  opposite  of  typography. \nBooks,  for  example,  are  an  excellent  container  for  the  accumu-\nlation,  quiet  scrutiny  and  organized  analysis  of information  and \nideas.  It  takes  time  to  write  a  book,  and  to  read  one;  time  to \ndiscuss  its  contents  and  to  make  judgments  about  their  merit,"

    "raw_text": "Amusing Ourselves  to Death 70 \nincluding  the  form  of their  presentation.  A  book  is  an attempt  to \nmake  thought  permanent  and  to  contribute  to  the  great  conver-\nsation  conducted  by  authors  of  the  past.  Therefore,  civilized \npeople  everywhere  consider  the  burning  of a book  a vile form  of \nanti-intellectualism.  But  the  telegraph  demands  that  we  burn  its \ncontents. The  value  of telegraphy  is  undermined  by  applying  the \ntests of  permanence,  continuity  or  coherence.  The  telegraph  is \nsuited  only  to  the  flashing  of  messages,  each  to  be  quickly  re-\nplaced  by  a  more  up-to-date  message.  Facts  push  other  facts \ninto  and  then  out  of consciousness  at  speeds  that  neither  permit \nnor  require  evaluation. \nThe telegraph  introduced  a  kind  of  public  conversation \nwhose  form  had  startling  characteristics:  Its  language  was  the \nlanguage  of  headlines—sensational,  fragmented,  impersonal. \nNews  took  the  form  of slogans,  to  be  noted  with  excitement,  to \nbe forgotten  with  dispatch.  Its  language  was  also  entirely  dis-\ncontinuous.  One  message  had  no  connection  to  that  which  pre-\nceded  or  followed  it.  Each  \"headline\"  stood  alone  as  its  own \ncontext.  The  receiver  of the  news  had  to  provide  a meaning  if he \ncould.  The  sender  was  under  no  obligation  to  do  so.  And  be-\ncause  of all this,  the  world  as  depicted  by  the  telegraph  began  to \nappear  unmanageable,  even  undecipherable.  The  line-by-line, \nsequential,  continuous  form  of the  printed  page  slowly  began  to \nlose its  resonance  as  a  metaphor  of  how  knowledge  was  to  be \nacquired  and  how  the  world  was  to  be understood.  \"Knowing\" \nthe facts  took  on  a  new  meaning,  for  it did  not  imply  that  one \nunderstood  implications,  background,  or  connections.  Tele-\ngraphic  discourse  permitted  no  time  for  historical  perspectives \nand gave  no  priority  to  the  qualitative.  To  the  telegraph,  intel-\nligence  meant  knowing  of  lots  of  things,  not  knowing  about \nthem. \nThus,  to  the  reverent  question  posed  by  Morse—What  hath \nGod wrought?—a  disturbing  answer  came  back:  a  neighbor-\nhood  of  strangers  and  pointless  quantity;  a  world  of  fragments \nand  discontinuities.  God,  of  course,  had  nothing  to  do  with  it.\n\f\nThe Peek-a-Boo World 71 \nAnd yet,  for  all of the  power  of  the  telegraph,  had  it  stood  alone \nas a  new  metaphor  for  discourse,  it  is  likely  that  print  culture \nwould  have  withstood  its  assault;  would,  at  least,  have  held  its \nground.  As  it happened,  at  almost  exactly  the  same  time  Morse \nwas reconceiving  the  meaning  of  information,  Louis  Daguerre \nwas reconceiving  the  meaning  of  nature;  one  might  even  say,  of \nreality  itself.  As Daguerre  remarked  in  1838  in a notice  designed \nto attract  investors,  \"The  daguerreotype  is  not  merely  an  instru-\nment  which  serves  to draw  nature  .  . . [it] gives  her  the  power  to \nreproduce  herself.\"4 \nOf course  both  the  need  and  the  power  to  draw  nature  have \nalways  implied  reproducing  nature,  refashioning  it  to  make  it \ncomprehensible  and  manageable.  The  earliest  cave  paintings \nwere  quite  possibly  visual  projections  of a hunt  that  had  not  yet \ntaken  place,  wish  fulfillments  of  an  anticipated  subjection  of \nnature.  Reproducing  nature,  in  other  words,  is  a very  old  idea. \nBut Daguerre  did  not  have  this  meaning  of  \"reproduce\"  in \nmind.  He  meant  to  announce  that  the  photograph  would  invest \neveryone  with  the  power  to  duplicate  nature  as  often  and  wher-\never one  liked.  He  meant  to  say  he  had  invented  the  world's \nfirst \"cloning\"  device,  that  the  photograph  was  to  visual  experi-\nence  what  the  printing  press  was  to  the  written  word. \nIn point  of  fact,  the  daguerreotype  was  not  quite  capable  of \nachieving  such  an  equation.  It  was  not  until  William  Henry  Fox \nTalbot,  an  English  mathematician  and  linguist,  invented  the \nprocess  of preparing  a negative  from  which  any  number  of  posi-\ntives could  be  made  that  the  mass  printing  and  publication  of \nphotographs  became  possible.5  The  name  \"photography\"  was \ngiven to  this  process  by  the  famous  astronomer  Sir  John  F.  W. \nHerschel.  It  is  an  odd  name  since  it  literally  means  \"writing \nwith  light.\"  Perhaps  Herschel  meant  the  name  to  be  taken  iron-\nically, since  it  must  have  been  clear  from  the  beginning  that \nphotography  and  writing  (in  fact,  language  in  any  form)  do  not \ninhabit  the  same  universe  of  discourse. \nNonetheless,  ever  since  the  process  was  named  it  has  been\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to Death 72 \nthe custom  to  speak  of  photography  as  a \"language.\"  The  meta-\nphor  is  risky  because  it  tends  to  obscure  the  fundamental  differ-\nences  between  the  two  modes  of  conversation.  To  begin  with, \nphotography  is  a language  that  speaks  only  in  particularities.  Its \nvocabulary  of  images  is  limited  to  concrete  representation.  Un-\nlike words  and  sentences,  the  photograph  does  not  present  to  us \nan idea  or  concept  about  the  world,  except  as  we  use  language \nitself to  convert  the  image  to  idea.  By  itself,  a photograph  can-\nnot  deal  with  the  unseen,  the  remote,  the  internal,  the  abstract. \nIt does  not  speak  of  \"man,\"  only  of  a  man;  not  of  \"tree,\"  only \nof a  tree.  You  cannot  produce  a  photograph  of  \"nature,\"  any \nmore  than  a  photograph  of  \"the  sea.\"  You can  only  photograph \na particular  fragment  of  the  here-and-now—a  cliff  of a  certain \nterrain,  in  a  certain  condition  of  light;  a  wave  at  a  moment  in \ntime,  from  a particular  point  of  view.  And  just  as  \"nature\"  and \n\"the  sea\"  cannot  be  photographed,  such  larger  abstractions  as \ntruth,  honor,  love,  falsehood  cannot  be  talked  about  in  the  lex-\nicon  of pictures.  For  \"showing  of  and  \"talking  about\"  are  two \nvery different  kinds  of  processes.  \"Pictures,\" Gavriel  Salomon \nhas written,  \"need  to  be  recognized,  words  need  to  be  under-\nstood.\"6  By  this  he  means  that  the  photograph  presents  the \nworld  as  object;  language,  the  world  as  idea.  For  even  the  sim-\nplest act  of  naming  a  thing  is  an act  of thinking—of  comparing \none  thing  with  others,  selecting  certain  features  in  common, \nignoring  what  is  different,  and  making  an  imaginary  category. \nThere  is  no  such  thing  in  nature  as  \"man\"  or  \"tree.\"  The  uni-\nverse  offers  no such  categories  or  simplifications;  only  flux  and \ninfinite  variety.  The  photograph  documents  and  celebrates  the \nparticularities  of  this  infinite  variety.  Language  makes  them \ncomprehensible. \nThe photograph  also  lacks  a  syntax,  which  deprives  it  of  a \ncapacity  to  argue  with  the  world.  As  an  \"objective\"  slice  of \nspace-time,  the  photograph  testifies  that  someone  was  there  or \nsomething  happened.  Its  testimony  is  powerful  but  it  offers  no \nopinions—no  \"should-have-beens\"  or  \"might-have-beens.\"\n\f\nThe Peek-a-Boo World 73 \nPhotography is  preeminently  a  world  of  fact,  not  of  dispute \nabout  facts  or of conclusions  to  be  drawn  from  them.  But  this  is \nnot to  say  photography  lacks  an  epistemological  bias.  As  Susan \nSontag  has  observed,  a  photograph  implies  \"that  we  know \nabout  the  world  if  we  accept  it  as  the  camera  records  it.\"7  But, \nas she  further  observes,  all  understanding  begins  with  our  not \naccepting  the  world  as  it  appears.  Language,  of  course,  is  the \nmedium  we  use  to  challenge,  dispute,  and  cross-examine  what \ncomes  into  view,  what  is  on  the  surface.  The  words  \"true\"  and \n\"false\"  come  from  the  universe  of  language,  and  no  other. \nWhen  applied  to  a  photograph,  the  question,  Is  it  true?  means \nonly,  Is  this  a  reproduction  of  a  real  slice  of  space-time?  If  the \nanswer  is  \"Yes,\"  there  are  no  grounds  for  argument,  for  it \nmakes  no  sense  to  disagree  with  an  unfaked  photograph.  The \nphotograph  itself  makes  no  arguable  propositions,  makes  no \nextended  and  unambiguous  commentary.  It  offers  no  assertions \nto refute,  so it  is not  refutable. \nThe way  in  which  the  photograph  records  experience  is  also \ndifferent  from  the  way  of  language.  Language  makes  sense  only \nwhen  it  is  presented  as  a  sequence  of  propositions.  Meaning  is \ndistorted  when  a  word  or  sentence  is,  as  we  say,  taken  out  of \ncontext;  when  a  reader  or  listener  is  deprived  of  what  was  said \nbefore,  and  after.  But  there  is  no  such  thing  as  a  photograph \ntaken  out  of  context,  for  a photograph  does  not  require  one.  In \nfact,  the  point  of  photography  is  to isolate  images  from  context, \nso as  to  make  them  visible  in  a  different  way.  In  a  world  of \nphotographic  images,  Ms.  Sontag  writes,  \"all  borders  .  . . seem \narbitrary.  Anything  can  be  separated,  can  be  made  discontin-\nuous,  from  anything  else:  All  that  is  necessary  is  to  frame  the \nsubject  differently.\"8  She  is remarking  on  the  capacity  of  photo-\ngraphs  to  perform  a  peculiar  kind  of  dismembering  of  reality,  a \nwrenching  of  moments  out  of  their  contexts,  and  a  juxtaposing \nof events  and  things  that  have  no  logical  or  historical \nconnection  with  each  other.  Like  telegraphy,  photography  re-\ncreates  the  world  as  a series  of  idiosyncratic  events.  There  is  no"

    "raw_text": "Amusing Ourselves  to Death 74 \nbeginning,  middle,  or  end  in  a world  of  photographs,  as  there  is \nnone  implied  by  telegraphy.  The  world  is  atomized.  There  is \nonly  a  present  and  it  need  not  be  part  of  any  story  that  can  be \ntold. \nThat  the  image  and  the  word  have  different  functions,  work \nat different  levels  of  abstraction,  and  require  different  modes  of \nresponse  will  not  come  as  a  new  idea  to  anyone.  Painting is  at \nleast  three  times  as  old  as  writing,  and  the  place  of  imagery  in \nthe repertoire  of  communication  instruments  was  quite  well \nunderstood  in  the  nineteenth  century.  What  was  new  in  the \nmid-nineteenth  century  was  the  sudden  and  massive  intrusion \nof the  photograph  and  other  iconographs  into  the  symbolic \nenvironment.  This  event  is  what  Daniel  Boorstin  in  his  pioneer-\ning book  The  Image  calls  \"the  graphic  revolution.\"  By  this \nphrase,  Boorstin  means  to  call  attention  to  the  fierce  assault  on \nlanguage  made  by  forms  of  mechanically  reproduced  imagery \nthat  spread  unchecked  throughout  American  culture—photo-\ngraphs,  prints,  posters,  drawings,  advertisements.  I  choose  the \nword  \"assault\"  deliberately  here,  to  amplify  the  point  implied \nin Boorstin's  \"graphic  revolution.\"  The  new  imagery,  with \nphotography  at  its  forefront,  did  not  merely  function  as  a  sup-\nplement  to  language,  but  bid  to  replace  it  as  our  dominant \nmeans  for  construing,  understanding,  and  testing  reality.  What \nBoorstin  implies  about  the  graphic  revolution,  I  wish  to  make \nexplicit  here:  The  new  focus  on  the  image  undermined  tradi-\ntional  definitions  of information,  of news,  and,  to  a large  extent, \nof reality  itself.  First  in  billboards,  posters,  and  advertisements, \nand  later  in  such  \"news\"  magazines  and  papers  as  Life,  Look, \nthe  New  York  Daily  Mirror  and  Daily  News,  the  picture  forced \nexposition  into  the  background,  and  in  some  instances  obliter-\nated  it  altogether.  By  the  end  of  the  nineteenth  century,  adver-\ntisers  and  newspapermen  had  discovered  that  a  picture  was  not \nonly  worth  a  thousand  words,  but,  where  sales  were  concerned, \nwas  better.  For  countless  Americans,  seeing,  not  reading,  be-\ncame  the  basis  for  believing.\n\f\nThe Peek-a-Boo World 75 \nIn a  peculiar  way,  the  photograph  was  the  perfect  com-\nplement  to  the  flood  of  telegraphic  news-from-nowhere  that \nthreatened  to  submerge  readers  in  a  sea  of  facts  from  unknown \nplaces  about  strangers  with  unknown  faces.  For the  photograph \ngave a  concrete  reality  to  the  strange-sounding  datelines,  and \nattached  faces  to the  unknown  names.  Thus  it provided  the  illu-\nsion,  at  least,  that  \"the  news\"  had  a  connection  to  something \nwithin  one's  sensory  experience.  It  created  an  apparent  context \nfor the  \"news  of  the  day.\"  And  the  \"news  of  the  day\"  created  a \ncontext  for  the  photograph. \nBut the  sense  of context  created  by  the  partnership  of  photo-\ngraph  and  headline  was,  of  course,  entirely  illusory.  You  may \nget a  better  sense  of  what  I  mean  here  if  you  imagine  a \nstranger's  informing  you  that  the  illyx  is  a  subspecies  of  ver-\nmiform  plant  with  articulated  leaves  that  flowers  biannually  on \nthe island  of  Aldononjes.  And  if  you  wonder  aloud,  \"Yes,  but \nwhat  has  that  to  do  with  anything?\"  imagine  that  your  infor-\nmant  replies,  \"But  here  is a photograph  I  want  you  to  see,\"  and \nhands  you  a  picture  labeled  Illyx  on Aldononjes. \"Ah,  yes,\"  you \nmight  murmur,  \"now  I  see.\"  It  is  true  enough  that  the  photo-\ngraph  provides  a context  for  the  sentence  you  have  been  given, \nand that  the  sentence  provides  a  context  of  sorts  for  the  photo-\ngraph,  and  you  may  even  believe  for  a  day  or  so  that \nyou have  learned  something.  But  if  the  event  is  entirely  self-\ncontained,  devoid  of any  relationship  to  your  past  knowledge  or \nfuture  plans,  if that  is  the  beginning  and  end  of  your  encounter \nwith  the  stranger,  then  the  appearance  of  context  provided  by \nthe conjunction  of  sentence  and  image  is  illusory,  and  so  is  the \nimpression  of  meaning  attached  to  it.  You  will,  in  fact,  have \n\"learned\"  nothing  (except  perhaps  to  avoid  strangers  with  pho-\ntographs),  and  the  illyx  will  fade  from  your  mental  landscape  as \nthough  it  had  never  been.  At  best  you  are  left  with  an  amusing \nbit of trivia,  good  for  trading  in  cocktail  party  chatter  or  solving \na crossword  puzzle,  but  nothing  more. \nIt may  be  of some  interest  to  note,  in  this  connection,  that  the\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to Death 76 \ncrossword  puzzle  became  a  popular  form  of diversion  in  Amer-\nica at  just  that  point  when  the  telegraph  and  the  photograph \nhad  achieved  the  transformation  of  news  from  functional  infor-\nmation  to  decontextualized  fact.  This  coincidence  suggests  that \nthe  new  technologies  had  turned  the  age-old  problem  of  infor-\nmation  on  its  head:  Where  people  once  sought  information  to \nmanage  the  real  contexts  of  their  lives,  now  they  had  to  invent \ncontexts  in  which  otherwise  useless  information  might  be  put \nto some  apparent  use.  The  crossword  puzzle  is  one  such \npseudo-context;  the  cocktail  party  is  another;  the  radio  quiz \nshows  of  the  1930's  and  1940's  and  the  modern  television \ngame  show  are  still  others;  and  the  ultimate,  perhaps,  is  the \nwildly  successful  \"Trivial  Pursuit.\" In  one  form  or another,  each \nof these  supplies  an  answer  to  the  question,  \"What  am  I  to  do \nwith  all  these  disconnected  facts?\"  And  in  one  form  or another, \nthe answer  is  the  same:  Why  not  use  them  for  diversion?  for \nentertainment?  to  amuse  yourself,  in  a  game?  In  The  Image, \nBoorstin  calls  the  major  creation  of  the  graphic  revolution  the \n\"pseudo-event,\"  by  which  he  means  an  event  specifically \nstaged  to  be  reported—like  the  press  conference,  say.  I mean  to \nsuggest  here  that  a  more  significant  legacy  of  the  telegraph  and \nthe  photograph  may  be  the  pseudo-context.  A pseudo-context  is \na structure  invented  to  give  fragmented  and  irrelevant  informa-\ntion  a  seeming  use.  But  the  use  the  pseudo-context  provides  is \nnot  action,  or  problem-solving,  or  change.  It  is the  only  use  left \nfor information  with  no  genuine  connection  to  our  lives.  And \nthat,  of  course,  is  to  amuse.  The  pseudo-context  is  the  last  ref-\nuge,  so  to  say,  of  a  culture  overwhelmed  by  irrelevance,  in-\ncoherence,  and  impotence. \nOf course,  photography  and  telegraphy  did  not  strike  down  at \none  blow  the  vast  edifice  that  was  typographic  culture.  The  hab-\nits of exposition,  as  I have  tried  to  show,  had  a  long  history,  and \nthey  held  powerful  sway  over  the  minds  of  turn-of-the-century \nAmericans.  In  fact,  the  early  decades  of  the  twentieth  century \nwere  marked  by  a  great  outpouring  of  brilliant  language  and\n\f\nThe Peek-a-Boo World 77 \nliterature.  In  the  pages  of  magazines  like  the  American Mercury \nand The  New  Yorker,  in  the  novels  and  stories  of  Faulkner, \nFitzgerald,  Steinbeck,  and  Hemingway,  and  even  in  the  col-\numns  of  the  newspaper  giants—the  Herald Tribune, the  Times— \nprose  thrilled  with  a  vibrancy  and  intensity  that  delighted  ear \nand eye.  But  this  was  exposition's  nightingale  song,  most  bril-\nliant and  sweet  as  the  singer  nears  the  moment  of  death.  It  told, \nfor the  Age of Exposition,  not  of new  beginnings,  but  of  an  end. \nBeneath  its  dying  melody,  a  new  note  had  been  sounded,  and \nphotography  and  telegraphy  set  the  key.  Theirs  was  a  \"lan-\nguage\"  that  denied  interconnectedness,  proceeded  without \ncontext,  argued  the  irrelevance  of  history,  explained  nothing, \nand offered  fascination  in  place  of  complexity  and  coherence. \nTheirs  was  a  duet  of  image  and  instancy,  and  together  they \nplayed  the  tune  of  a new  kind  of  public  discourse  in  America. \nEach of the  media  that  entered  the  electronic  conversation  in \nthe late  nineteenth  and  early  twentieth  centuries  followed  the \nlead of  the  telegraph  and  the  photograph,  and  amplified  their \nbiases.  Some,  such  as  film,  were  by  their  nature  inclined  to  do \nso. Others,  whose  bias  was  rather  toward  the  amplification  of \nrational  speech—like  radio—were  overwhelmed  by  the  thrust \nof the  new  epistemology  and  came  in  the  end  to  support  it. \nTogether,  this  ensemble  of  electronic  techniques  called  into \nbeing  a  new  world—a  peek-a-boo  world,  where  now  this \nevent,  now  that,  pops  into  view  for  a  moment,  then  vanishes \nagain.  It  is  a world  without  much  coherence  or  sense;  a  world \nthat  does  not  ask  us,  indeed,  does  not  permit  us  to  do  anything; \na world  that  is,  like  the  child's  game  of  peek-a-boo,  entirely \nself-contained.  But  like  peek-a-boo,  it  is  also  endlessly  enter-\ntaining. \nOf course,  there  is  nothing  wrong  with  playing  peek-a-boo. \nAnd there  is  nothing  wrong  with  entertainment.  As  some  psy-\nchiatrist  once  put  it,  we  all build  castles  in  the  air.  The  problems \ncome  when  we  try  to  live  in them.  The  communications  media \nof the  late  nineteenth  and  early  twentieth  centuries,  with  tele-\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to Death 78 \ngraphy  and  photography  at  their  center,  called  the  peek-a-boo \nworld  into  existence,  but  we  did  not  come  to  live  there  until \ntelevision.  Television  gave  the  epistemological  biases  of the  tele-\ngraph  and  the  photograph  their  most  potent  expression,  raising \nthe interplay  of  image  and  instancy  to  an  exquisite  and  dan-\ngerous  perfection.  And  it  brought  them  into  the  home.  We  are \nby now  well  into  a  second  generation  of  children  for  whom \ntelevision  has  been  their  first  and  most  accessible  teacher  and, \nfor many,  their  most  reliable  companion  and  friend.  To  put  it \nplainly,  television  is  the  command  center  of the  new  epistemol-\nogy. There  is  no  audience  so  young  that  it  is barred  from  televi-\nsion.  There  is  no  poverty  so  abject  that  it  must  forgo  television. \nThere  is no education  so  exalted  that  it  is not  modified  by televi-\nsion.  And  most  important  of  all,  there  is  no  subject  of  public \ninterest—politics,  news,  education,  religion,  science,  sports— \nthat  does  not  find  its  way  to  television.  Which  means  that  all \npublic  understanding  of  these  subjects  is shaped  by  the  biases  of \ntelevision. \nTelevision  is  the  command  center  in  subtler  ways  as well.  Our \nuse of other  media,  for  example,  is  largely  orchestrated  by  tele-\nvision.  Through  it  we  learn  what  telephone  system  to  use,  what \nmovies  to  see,  what  books,  records  and  magazines  to  buy,  what \nradio  programs  to  listen  to.  Television  arranges  our  communi-\ncations  environment  for  us  in  ways  that  no  other  medium  has \nthe  power  to  do. \nAs a small,  ironic  example  of  this  point,  consider  this:  In  the \npast few  years,  we  have  been  learning  that  the  computer  is  the \ntechnology  of  the  future.  We  are  told  that  our  children  will  fail \nin school  and  be  left  behind  in  life  if they  are  not  \"computer \nliterate.\"  We  are  told  that  we  cannot  run  our  businesses,  or \ncompile  our  shopping  lists,  or  keep  our  checkbooks  tidy  unless \nwe own  a  computer.  Perhaps some  of  this  is  true.  But  the  most \nimportant  fact  about  computers  and  what  they  mean  to  our \nlives is that  we  learn  about  all  of this  from  television.  Television \nhas achieved  the  status  of  \"meta-medium\"—an  instrument\n\f\nThe Peek-a-Boo World 79 \nthat  directs  not  only  our  knowledge  of  the  world,  but  our \nknowledge  of  ways  of knowing as  well. \nAt the  same  time,  television  has  achieved  the  status  of \n\"myth,\"  as  Roland  Barthes  uses  the  word.  He  means  by  myth  a \nway of understanding  the  world  that  is not problematic,  that  we \nare not  fully  conscious  of,  that  seems,  in  a  word,  natural.  A \nmyth  is  a  way  of  thinking  so  deeply  embedded  in  our  con-\nsciousness  that  it  is invisible.  This  is  now  the  way  of  television. \nWe are  no  longer  fascinated  or  perplexed  by  its  machinery.  We \ndo not  tell  stories  of  its  wonders.  We  do  not  confine  our  televi-\nsion sets  to  special  rooms.  We  do  not  doubt  the  reality  of  what \nwe see  on  television,  are  largely  unaware  of  the  special  angle  of \nvision it  affords.  Even  the  question  of  how  television  affects  us \nhas receded  into  the  background.  The  question  itself  may  strike \nsome  of us as strange,  as  if one  were  to  ask  how  having  ears  and \neyes affects  us. Twenty  years  ago,  the  question,  Does  television \nshape  culture  or  merely  reflect  it?  held  considerable  interest  for \nmany  scholars  and  social  critics.  The  question  has  largely  disap-\npeared  as  television  has  gradually  become  our  culture.  This \nmeans,  among  other  things,  that  we  rarely  talk  about  television, \nonly about  what  is  on television—that  is,  about  its  content.  Its \necology,  which  includes  not  only  its  physical  characteristics  and \nsymbolic  code  but  the  conditions  in  which  we  normally  attend \nto it,  is taken  for  granted,  accepted  as  natural. \nTelevision  has  become,  so  to speak,  the  background  radiation \nof the  social  and  intellectual  universe,  the  all-but-imperceptible \nresidue  of  the  electronic  big  bang  of  a  century  past,  so  familiar \nand so  thoroughly  integrated  with  American  culture  that  we  no \nlonger  hear  its  faint  hissing  in  the  background  or  see  the  flicker-\ning gray  light.  This,  in  turn,  means  that  its  epistemology  goes \nlargely unnoticed.  And  the  peek-a-boo  world  it  has  constructed \naround  us  no  longer  seems  even  strange. \nThere  is  no  more  disturbing  consequence  of  the  electronic \nand graphic  revolution  than  this:  that  the  world  as  given  to  us \nthrough  television  seems  natural,  not  bizarre.  For  the  loss  of the\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to Death 80 \nsense  of  the  strange  is  a  sign  of  adjustment,  and  the  extent  to \nwhich  we  have  adjusted  is  a measure  of  the  extent  to  which  we \nhave  been  changed.  Our  culture's  adjustment  to  the  epistemol-\nogy of  television  is  by now  all  but  complete;  we  have  so  thor-\noughly  accepted  its  definitions  of truth,  knowledge,  and  reality \nthat  irrelevance  seems  to  us  to  be  filled  with  import,  and  in-\ncoherence  seems  eminently  sane.  And  if  some  of  our  institu-\ntions  seem  not  to  fit  the  template  of  the  times,  why  it  is  they, \nand not  the  template,  that  seem  to  us  disordered  and  strange. \nIt is  my  object  in  the  rest  of  this  book  to  make  the  episte-\nmology  of  television  visible  again.  I  will  try  to  demonstrate  by \nconcrete  example  that  television's  way  of  knowing  is  uncom-\npromisingly  hostile  to  typography's  way  of  knowing;  that  tele-\nvision's  conversations  promote  incoherence  and  triviality;  that \nthe phrase  \"serious  television\"  is  a contradiction  in  terms;  and \nthat  television  speaks  in  only  one  persistent  voice—the  voice  of \nentertainment.  Beyond  that,  I  will  try  to  demonstrate  that  to \nenter  the  great  television  conversation,  one  American  cultural \ninstitution  after  another  is  learning  to  speak  its  terms.  Televi-\nsion,  in  other  words,  is  transforming  our  culture  into  one  vast \narena  for  show  business.  It  is entirely  possible,  of course,  that  in \nthe end  we  shall  find  that  delightful,  and  decide  we  like  it  just \nfine. That  is  exactly  what  Aldous  Huxley  feared  was  coming, \nfifty years  ago.\n\f\nPart II."

After  a \nwhiff of panic,  he  was  able  to  restore  both  his  equanimity  and \nhis chances  for  a satisfactory  grade  by  turning  on  the  television \nset, turning  off  the  sound,  and  with  his  back  to  the  set,  using  its \nlight to  read  important  passages  on  which  he  was  to  be  tested. \nThis is  one  use  of  television—as  a  source  of  illuminating  the \nprinted  page. \nBut the  television  screen  is  more  than  a  light  source.

To \nmake  such  a  mistake  in  the  matter  at  hand  is  to  misconstrue \nentirely  how  television  redefines  the  meaning  of  public  dis-\ncourse.  Television  does  not  extend  or  amplify  literate  culture.  It \nattacks  it.  If  television  is  a  continuation  of  anything,  it  is  of  a \ntradition  begun  by  the  telegraph  and  photograph  in  the  mid-\nnineteenth  century,  not  by  the  printing  press  in  the  fifteenth. \nWhat  is  television?  What  kinds  of  conversations  does  it  per-\nmit?  What  are  the  intellectual  tendencies  it  encourages?  What \nsort of  culture  does  it  produce? \nThese  are  the  questions  to  be  addressed  in  the  rest  of  this \nbook,  and  to  approach  them  with  a  minimum  of  confusion,  I \nmust  begin  by  making  a  distinction  between  a  technology  and  a \nmedium.  We  might  say  that  a  technology  is  to a medium  as  the \nbrain  is  to  the  mind.  Like  the  brain,  a  technology  is  a physical \napparatus.  Like  the  mind,  a  medium  is  a use  to which  a  physical \napparatus  is  put.  A technology  becomes  a medium  as  it employs \na particular  symbolic  code,  as  it  finds  its  place  in  a  particular \nsocial setting,  as  it  insinuates  itself  into  economic  and  political \ncontexts.  A  technology,  in  other  words,  is  merely  a  machine.  A \nmedium  is  the  social  and  intellectual  environment  a  machine \ncreates. \nOf course,  like  the  brain  itself,  every  technology  has  an  inher-\nent bias.  It  has  within  its  physical  form  a predisposition  toward \nbeing  used  in  certain  ways  and  not  others.  Only  those  who \nknow  nothing  of  the  history  of  technology  believe  that  a  tech-\nnology  is  entirely  neutral.  There  is  an  old  joke  that  mocks  that \nnaive  belief.  Thomas  Edison,  it  goes,  would  have  revealed  his \ndiscovery  of  the  electric  light  much  sooner  than  he  did  except \nfor the  fact  that  every  time  he  turned  it  on,  he  held  it  to  his \nmouth  and  said,  \"Hello?  Hello?\" \nNot very  likely.  Each  technology  has  an  agenda  of  its own.  It \nis, as I have  suggested,  a  metaphor  waiting  to  unfold.

And,  one  imagines,  the  Roman  Cath-\nolic Church  would  not  have  objected  to  its  being  so  used  in  the \nsixteenth  century.  Had  that  been  the  case,  the  Protestant  Refor-\nmation  might  not  have  occurred,  for  as Luther  contended,  with \nthe word  of  God  on  every  family's  kitchen  table,  Christians  do \nnot require  the  Papacy  to  interpret  it  for  them.  But  in  fact  there \nnever  was  much  chance  that  the  press  would  be  used  solely,  or \neven  very  much,  for  the duplication  of icons.  From  its  beginning \nin the  fifteenth  century,  the  press  was  perceived  as  an extraordi-\nnary  opportunity  for  the  display  and  mass  distribution  of  writ-\nten language.  Everything  about  its  technical  possibilities  led  in \nthat  direction.  One  might  even  say  it  was  invented  for  that \npurpose. \nThe technology  of  television  has  a  bias,  as  well.  It  is conceiv-\nable to  use  television  as  a lamp,  a  surface  for  texts,  a  bookcase, \neven as  radio.  But  it  has  not  been  so  used  and  will  not  be  so \nused,  at  least  in  America.  Thus,  in  answering  the  question, \nWhat  is  television?,  we  must  understand  as  a first point  that  we \nare not  talking  about  television  as  a technology  but  television  as \na medium.  There  are  many  places  in  the  world  where  televi-\nsion,  though  the  same  technology  as  it  is  in  America,  is  an  en-\ntirely different  medium  from  that  which  we  know.  I  refer  to \nplaces  where  the  majority  of people  do  not  have  television  sets, \nand those  who  do  have  only  one;  where  only  one  station  is \navailable;  where  television  does  not  operate  around  the  clock; \nwhere  most  programs  have  as  their  purpose  the  direct  fur-\ntherance  of  government  ideology  and  policy;  where  commer-\ncials are  unknown,  and  \"talking  heads\"  are  the  principal \nimage;  where  television  is  mostly  used  as  if  it  were  radio.  For \nthese  reasons  and  more  television  will  not  have  the  same  mean-\ning or  power  as  it does  in  America,  which  is  to say,  it is possible \nfor a  technology  to  be  so  used  that  its  potentialities  are  pre-\nvented  from  developing  and  its  social  consequences  kept  to  a \nminimum."

    "raw_text": "Amusing Ourselves  to Death 86 \nBut in  America,  this  has  not  been  the  case.  Television  has \nfound  in  liberal  democracy  and  a  relatively  free  market  econ-\nomy a  nurturing  climate  in which  its  full  potentialities  as  a tech-\nnology  of  images  could  be  exploited.  One  result  of this  has  been \nthat  American  television  programs  are  in  demand  all  over  the \nworld.  The  total  estimate  of  U.S.  television  program  exports  is \napproximately  100,000  to  200,000  hours,  equally  divided \namong  Latin  America,  Asia  and  Europe.1  Over  the  years,  pro-\ngrams  like  \"Gunsmoke,\"  \"Bonanza,\"  \"Mission:  Impossible,\" \n\"Star  Trek,\"  \"Kojak,\"  and  more  recently,  \"Dallas\"  and  \"Dy-\nnasty\"  have  been  as  popular  in  England,  Japan,  Israel  and  Nor-\nway as  in Omaha,  Nebraska.  I  have  heard  (but  not  verified)  that \nsome  years  ago  the  Lapps  postponed  for  several  days  their  an-\nnual  and,  one  supposes,  essential  migratory  journey  so  that \nthey  could  find  out  who  shot  J.R.  All of this  has  occurred  simul-\ntaneously  with  the  decline  of  America's  moral  and  political \nprestige,  worldwide.  American  television  programs  are  in  de-\nmand  not  because  America  is  loved  but  because  American  tele-\nvision  is  loved. \nWe need  not  be  detained  too  long  in  figuring  out  why.  In \nwatching  American  television,  one  is  reminded  of  George  Ber-\nnard  Shaw's  remark  on  his  first  seeing  the  glittering  neon  signs \nof Broadway  and  42nd  Street  at  night.  It  must  be  beautiful,  he \nsaid, if you  cannot  read.  American  television  is,  indeed,  a  beau-\ntiful  spectacle,  a  visual  delight,  pouring  forth  thousands  of  im-\nages on  any  given  day.  The  average  length  of  a shot  on  network \ntelevision  is  only  3.5  seconds,  so  that  the  eye  never  rests,  always \nhas something  new  to  see.  Moreover,  television  offers  viewers  a \nvariety  of subject  matter,  requires  minimal  skills  to comprehend \nit, and  is  largely  aimed  at  emotional  gratification.  Even  com-\nmercials,  which  some  regard  as  an  annoyance,  are  exquisitely \ncrafted,  always  pleasing  to  the  eye  and  accompanied  by  exciting \nmusic.  There  is no  question  but  that  the  best  photography  in  the \nworld  is  presently  seen  on  television  commercials.  American\n\f\nThe Age of Show Business 87 \ntelevision,  in  other  words,  is  devoted  entirely  to  supplying  its \naudience  with  entertainment. \nOf course,  to  say  that  television  is  entertaining  is  merely  ba-\nnal. Such  a  fact  is  hardly  threatening  to  a  culture,  not  even \nworth  writing  a  book  about.  It  may  even  be  a reason  for  rejoic-\ning. Life,  as we  like  to  say,  is  not  a  highway  strewn  with  flow-\ners. The  sight  of  a  few  blossoms  here  and  there  may  make  our \njourney  a  trifle  more  endurable.  The  Lapps  undoubtedly \nthought  so.  We  may  surmise  that  the  ninety  million  Americans \nwho  watch  television  every  night  also  think  so.  But  what  I  am \nclaiming  here  is not  that  television  is  entertaining  but  that  it  has \nmade  entertainment  itself  the  natural  format  for  the  representa-\ntion of  all  experience.  Our  television  set  keeps  us  in  constant \ncommunion  with  the  world,  but  it  does  so  with  a  face  whose \nsmiling  countenance  is  unalterable.  The  problem  is  not  that \ntelevision  presents  us  with  entertaining  subject  matter  but  that \nall subject  matter  is  presented  as  entertaining,  which  is  another \nissue altogether. \nTo say  it  still  another  way:  Entertainment  is  the  supra-\nideology  of  all  discourse  on  television.  No  matter  what  is  de-\npicted or  from  what  point  of  view,  the  overarching  presumption \nis that  it  is there  for  our  amusement  and  pleasure.  That  is  why \neven on  news  shows  which  provide  us  daily  with  fragments  of \ntragedy  and  barbarism,  we  are  urged  by  the  newscasters  to \n\"join  them  tomorrow.\"  What  for?  One  would  think  that  several \nminutes  of  murder  and  mayhem  would  suffice  as material  for  a \nmonth  of  sleepless  nights.  We  accept  the  newscasters'  invitation \nbecause  we  know  that  the  \"news\"  is  not  to  be  taken  seriously, \nthat  it is all in fun,  so to say.  Everything  about  a  news  show  tells \nus this—the  good  looks  and  amiability  of the  cast,  their  pleasant \nbanter,  the  exciting  music  that  opens  and  closes  the  show,  the \nvivid film  footage,  the  attractive  commercials—all  these  and \nmore  suggest  that  what  we  have  just  seen  is  no cause  for  weep-\ning. A  news  show,  to  put  it  plainly,  is  a  format  for  entertain-\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to  Death 88 \nment,  not  for  education,  reflection  or  catharsis.  And  we  must \nnot  judge  too  harshly  those  who  have  framed  it  in  this  way. \nThey  are  not  assembling  the  news  to  be  read,  or  broadcasting  it \nto be  heard.  They  are  televising  the  news  to  be  seen.  They  must \nfollow  where  their  medium  leads.  There  is  no  conspiracy  here, \nno lack  of  intelligence,  only  a  straightforward  recognition  that \n\"good  television\"  has  little  to  do  with  what  is  \"good\"  about \nexposition  or  other  forms  of  verbal  communication  but  every-\nthing  to  do  with  what  the  pictorial  images  look  like. \nI should  like  to  illustrate  this  point  by  offering  the  case  of the \neighty-minute  discussion  provided  by  the  ABC  network  on  No-\nvember  20,  1983,  following  its  controversial  movie  The  Day \nAfter. Though  the  memory  of  this  telecast  has  receded  for  most, \nI choose  this  case  because,  clearly,  here  was  television  taking  its \nmost  \"serious\"  and  \"responsible\"  stance.  Everything  that  made \nup this  broadcast  recommended  it  as a critical  test  of television's \ncapacity  to  depart  from  an  entertainment  mode  and  rise  to  the \nlevel of  public  instruction.  In  the  first  place,  the  subject  was  the \npossibility  of  a  nuclear  holocaust.  Second,  the  film  itself  had \nbeen  attacked  by  several  influential  bodies  politic,  including  the \nReverend  Jerry  Falwell's  Moral  Majority.  Thus,  it  was  impor-\ntant  that  the  network  display  television's  value  and  serious  in-\ntentions  as  a  medium  of  information  and  coherent  discourse. \nThird,  on  the  program  itself  no  musical  theme  was  used  as \nbackground—a  significant  point  since  almost  all  television  pro-\ngrams  are  embedded  in  music,  which  helps  to  tell  the  audience \nwhat  emotions  are  to  be  called  forth.  This  is  a standard  theatri-\ncal device,  and  its  absence  on  television  is  always  ominous. \nFourth,  there  were  no  commercials  during  the  discussion,  thus \nelevating  the  tone  of  the  event  to  the  state  of  reverence  usually \nreserved  for  the  funerals  of assassinated  Presidents. And  finally, \nthe  participants  included  Henry  Kissinger,  Robert  McNamara, \nand  Elie  Wiesel,  each  of  whom  is  a  symbol  of  sorts  of  serious \ndiscourse.  Although  Kissinger,  somewhat  later,  made  an  ap-\npearance  on  the  hit  show  \"Dynasty,\"  he  was  then  and  still  is  a\n\f\nThe Age of Show Business 89 \nparadigm  of  intellectual  sobriety;  and  Wiesel,  practically  a \nwalking  metaphor  of  social  conscience.  Indeed,  the  other  mem-\nbers of  the  cast—Carl  Sagan,  William  Buckley  and  General \nBrent  Scowcroft—are,  each  in  his  way,  men  of  intellectual \nbearing  who  are  not  expected  to  participate  in  trivial  public \nmatters. \nThe program  began  with  Ted  Koppel,  master  of  ceremonies, \nso to  speak,  indicating  that  what  followed  was  not  intended  to \nbe a debate  but  a  discussion. And  so  those  who  are  interested  in \nphilosophies  of  discourse  had  an  excellent  opportunity  to  ob-\nserve what  serious  television  means  by  the  word  \"discussion.\" \nHere is  what  it  means:  Each  of  six  men  was  given  approxi-\nmately  five  minutes  to  say  something  about  the  subject.  There \nwas, however,  no  agreement  on  exactly  what  the  subject  was, \nand no  one  felt  obliged  to  respond  to  anything  anyone  else  said. \nIn fact,  it  would  have  been  difficult  to  do  so,  since  the  partici-\npants  were  called  upon  seriatim,  as  if  they  were  finalists  in  a \nbeauty  contest,  each  being  given  his  share  of minutes  in  front  of \nthe camera.  Thus,  if Mr.  Wiesel,  who  was  called  upon  last,  had \na response  to  Mr.  Buckley,  who  was  called  upon  first,  there \nwould  have  been  four  commentaries  in  between,  occupying \nabout  twenty  minutes,  so  that  the  audience  (if  not  Mr.  Wiesel \nhimself)  would  have  had  difficulty  remembering  the  argument \nwhich  prompted  his  response.  In  fact,  the  participants—most  of \nwhom  were  no  strangers  to  television—largely  avoided  ad-\ndressing  each  other's  points.  They  used  their  initial  minutes  and \nthen  their  subsequent  ones  to  intimate  their  position  or  give  an \nimpression.  Dr.  Kissinger,  for  example,  seemed  intent  on  mak-\ning viewers  feel  sorry  that  he  was  no  longer  their  Secretary  of \nState by reminding  everyone  of books  he  had  once  written,  pro-\nposals  he  had  once  made,  and  negotiations  he  had  once  con-\nducted.  Mr.  McNamara  informed  the  audience  that  he  had \neaten  lunch  in  Germany  that  very  afternoon,  and  went  on  to \nsay that  he  had  at  least  fifteen  proposals  to  reduce  nuclear  arms. \nOne would  have  thought  that  the  discussion  would  turn  on  this\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to Death 90 \nissue,  but  the  others  seemed  about  as  interested  in  it  as  they \nwere  in  what  he  had  for  lunch  in  Germany.  (Later,  he  took  the \ninitiative  to  mention  three  of  his  proposals  but  they  were  not \ndiscussed.)  Elie  Wiesel,  in  a  series  of  quasi-parables  and  para-\ndoxes,  stressed  the  tragic  nature  of  the  human  condition,  but \nbecause  he  did  not  have  the  time  to  provide  a  context  for  his \nremarks,  he  seemed  quixotic  and  confused,  conveying  an  im-\npression  of  an  itinerant  rabbi  who  has  wandered  into  a coven  of \nGentiles. \nIn other  words,  this  was  no  discussion  as  we normally  use  the \nword.  Even  when  the  \"discussion\"  period  began,  there  were  no \narguments  or  counterarguments,  no  scrutiny  of  assumptions, \nno explanations,  no  elaborations,  no  definitions.  Carl  Sagan \nmade,  in  my  opinion,  the  most  coherent  statement—a  four-\nminute  rationale  for  a nuclear  freeze—but  it  contained  at  least \ntwo  questionable  assumptions  and  was  not  carefully  examined. \nApparently,  no  one  wanted  to  take  time  from  his own  few  min-\nutes  to  call  attention  to  someone  else's.  Mr.  Koppel,  for  his part, \nfelt obliged  to  keep  the  \"show\"  moving,  and  though  he  occa-\nsionally  pursued  what  he  discerned  as  a line  of thought,  he  was \nmore  concerned  to  give  each  man  his  fair  allotment  of  time. \nBut it  is  not  time  constraints  alone  that  produce  such  frag-\nmented  and  discontinuous  language.  When  a  television  show  is \nin process,  it  is very  nearly  impermissible  to  say,  \"Let  me  think \nabout  that\"  or  \"I  don't  know\"  or  \"What  do  you  mean  when \nyou say  .  .  .  ?\"  or  \"From  what  sources  does  your  information \ncome?\"  This  type  of  discourse  not  only  slows  down  the  tempo \nof the  show  but  creates  the  impression  of  uncertainty  or  lack  of \nfinish. It  tends  to  reveal  people  in  the  act of thinking, which  is  as \ndisconcerting  and  boring  on  television  as  it  is  on  a  Las  Vegas \nstage.  Thinking  does  not  play  well  on  television,  a  fact  that  tele-\nvision  directors  discovered  long  ago.  There  is not  much  to  see in \nit. It  is,  in  a  phrase,  not  a  performing  art.  But  television  de-\nmands  a  performing  art,  and  so  what  the  ABC network  gave  us \nwas a  picture  of  men  of  sophisticated  verbal  skills  and  political\n\f\nThe Age of  Show Business 91 \nunderstanding  being  brought  to  heel by a medium  that  requires \nthem to  fashion  performances  rather  than  ideas.  Which  ac-\ncounts for  why  the  eighty  minutes  were  very  entertaining,  in \nthe way  of  a  Samuel  Beckett  play:  The  intimations  of  gravity \nhung heavy,  the  meaning  passeth  all  understanding.  The  per-\nformances,  of course,  were  highly  professional.  Sagan  abjured \nthe turtle-neck  sweater  in which  he  starred  when  he  did \"Cos-\nmos.\"  He even had  his  hair  cut  for  the event.  His part was  that \nof the logical scientist speaking  in behalf of the planet.  It is to be \ndoubted that  Paul Newman  could  have  done  better  in  the  role, \nalthough  Leonard  Nimoy  might  have.  Scowcroft  was  suitably \nmilitary in  his  bearing—terse  and  distant,  the  unbreakable  de-\nfender of national  security.  Kissinger, as  always,  was  superb  in \nthe part  of  the  knowing  world  statesman,  weary  of  the  sheer \nresponsibility of  keeping  disaster  at  bay.  Koppel  played  to  per-\nfection the  part  of a moderator,  pretending,  as  it were,  that  he \nwas sorting out ideas while,  in fact; he was merely directing  the \nperformances.  At  the  end,  one  could  only  applaud  those  per-\nformances, which  is  what  a  good  television  program  always \naims to achieve;  that  is to say, applause,  not  reflection. \nI do not say categorically that  it is impossible to use television \nas a carrier of coherent  language  or thought  in process. William \nBuckley's own  program,  \"Firing  Line,\"  occasionally  shows \npeople in the  act of thinking  but  who  also happen  to  have  tele-\nvision cameras  pointed  at them.  There are other  programs,  such \nas \"Meet  the  Press\" or  \"The  Open  Mind,\"  which  clearly  strive \nto maintain  a sense of intellectual  decorum  and typographic  tra-\ndition, but they are scheduled  so  that they  do not compete  with \nprograms of great visual  interest,  since  otherwise,  they  will  not \nbe watched.  After  all, it  is  not  unheard  of  that  a  format  will \noccasionally go against the  bias of its medium.  For example,  the \nmost popular  radio  program  of the early 1940's  featured  a ven-\ntriloquist, and  in  those  days,  I heard  more  than  once  the  feet of \na tap dancer  on the  \"Major  Bowes'  Amateur  Hour.\"  (Indeed,  if \nI am not  mistaken,  he  even  once  featured  a pantomimist.)

    "raw_text": "Amusing Ourselves  to Death 92 \nventriloquism,  dancing  and  mime  do  not  play  well  on  radio, \njust  as  sustained,  complex  talk  does  not  play  well  on  television. \nIt can  be  made  to  play  tolerably  well  if only  one  camera  is  used \nand  the  visual  image  is  kept  constant—as  when  the  President \ngives  a  speech.  But  this  is  not  television  at  its  best,  and  it  is  not \ntelevision  that  most  people  will  choose  to  watch.  The  single \nmost  important  fact  about  television  is  that  people  watch  it, \nwhich  is  why  it  is called  \"television.  \"And  what  they  watch,  and \nlike to  watch,  are  moving  pictures—millions  of  them,  of  short \nduration  and  dynamic  variety.  It  is in the  nature  of  the  medium \nthat  it  must  suppress  the  content  of  ideas  in  order  to  accommo-\ndate  the  requirements  of  visual  interest;  that  is  to say,  to  accom-\nmodate  the  values  of  show  business. \nFilm,  records  and  radio  (now  that  it  is an adjunct  of the  music \nindustry)  are,  of  course,  equally  devoted  to  entertaining  the  cul-\nture,  and  their  effects  in altering  the  style  of American  discourse \nare not  insignificant.  But  television  is  different  because  it  en-\ncompasses  all  forms  of discourse.  No  one  goes  to  a movie  to  find \nout  about  government  policy  or  the  latest  scientific  advances. \nNo one  buys  a  record  to  find  out  the  baseball  scores  or  the \nweather  or  the  latest  murder.  No  one  turns  on  radio  anymore \nfor soap  operas  or  a  presidential  address  (if  a television  set  is  at \nhand).  But  everyone  goes  to  television  for  all  these  things  and \nmore,  which  is  why  television  resonates  so  powerfully  through-\nout  the  culture.  Television  is  our  culture's  principal  mode  of \nknowing  about  itself.  Therefore—and  this  is the  critical  point— \nhow  television  stages  the  world  becomes  the  model  for  how  the \nworld  is  properly  to  be staged.  It is not  merely  that  on  the  televi-\nsion  screen  entertainment  is  the  metaphor  for  all discourse.  It  is \nthat  off  the  screen  the  same  metaphor  prevails.  As  typography \nonce  dictated  the  style  of conducting  politics,  religion,  business, \neducation,  law  and  other  important  social  matters,  television \nnow  takes  command.  In  courtrooms,  classrooms,  operating \nrooms,  board  rooms,  churches  and  even  airplanes,  Americans \nno longer  talk  to  each  other,  they  entertain  each  other.  They  do\n\f\nThe Age of Show Business 93 \nnot exchange  ideas;  they  exchange  images.  They  do  not  argue \nwith  propositions;  they  argue  with  good  looks,  celebrities  and \ncommercials.  For  the  message  of  television  as  metaphor  is  not \nonly that  all  the  world  is  a stage  but  that  the  stage  is  located  in \nLas Vegas,  Nevada. \nIn Chicago,  for  example,  the  Reverend  Greg  Sakowicz,  a  Ro-\nman  Catholic  priest,  mixes  his  religious  teaching  with  rock  'n' \nroll music.  According  to  the  Associated  Press,  the  Reverend \nSakowicz  is  both  an  associate  pastor  at  the  Church  of  the  Holy \nSpirit in Schaumberg  (a  suburb  of Chicago)  and  a  disc  jockey  at \nWKQX. On  his  show,  \"The  Journey  Inward,\"  Father  Sakowicz \nchats  in  soft  tones  about  such  topics  as  family  relationships  or \ncommitment,  and  interposes  his  sermons  with  \"the  sound  of \nBillboard's Top  10.\"  He says  that  his  preaching  is  not  done  \"in  a \nchurchy  way,\"  and  adds,  \"You  don't  have  to  be  boring  in  order \nto be  holy.\" \nMeanwhile  in  New  York  City  at  St.  Patrick's  Cathedral,  Fa-\nther  John  J.  O'Connor  put  on  a  New  York  Yankee  baseball  cap \nas he  mugged  his  way  through  his  installation  as  Archbishop  of \nthe New  York  Archdiocese.  He  got  off  some  excellent  gags,  at \nleast one  of  which  was  specifically  directed  at  Mayor  Edward \nKoch,  who  was  a member  of his  audience;  that  is to say,  he  was \na congregant.  At  his  next  public  performance,  the  new  arch-\nbishop  donned  a  New  York  Mets  baseball  cap.  These  events \nwere,  of  course,  televised,  and  were  vastly  entertaining,  largely \nbecause  Archbishop  (now  Cardinal)  O'Connor  has  gone  Father \nSakowicz  one  better:  Whereas  the  latter  believes  that  you  don't \nhave  to  be boring  to  be holy,  the  former  apparently  believes  you \ndon't  have  to  be  holy  at  all. \nIn Phoenix,  Arizona,  Dr. Edward  Dietrich  performed  triple  by-\npass surgery  on  Bernard  Schuler.  The  operation  was  successful, \nwhich  was  nice  for  Mr. Schuler.  It was  also  on television,  which \nwas nice  for  America.  The  operation  was  carried  by  at  least  fifty \ntelevision  stations  in  the  United  States,  and  also  by  the  British \nBroadcasting  Corporation.  A  two-man  panel  of  narrators  (a\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to Death 94 \nplay-by-play  and  color  man,  so  to speak)  kept  viewers  informed \nabout  what  they  were  seeing.  It  was  not  clear  as  to  why  this \nevent  was  televised,  but  it  resulted  in  transforming  both  Dr.  Die-\ntrich  and  Mr.  Schuler's  chest  into  celebrities.  Perhaps because \nhe has  seen  too  many  doctor  shows  on  television,  Mr.  Schuler \nwas  uncommonly  confident  about  the  outcome  of  his  surgery. \n\"There  is  no  way  in  hell  they  are  going  to  lose  me  on  live  TV,\" \nhe said.2 \nAs reported  with  great  enthusiasm  by  both  WCBS-TV  and \nWNBC-TV  in  1984,  the  Philadelphia public  schools  have  em-\nbarked  on  an  experiment  in  which  children  will  have  their  cur-\nriculum  sung  to  them.  Wearing  Walkman  equipment,  students \nwere  shown  listening  to  rock  music  whose  lyrics  were  about  the \neight  parts  of  speech.  Mr.  Jocko  Henderson,  who  thought  of \nthis  idea,  is  planning  to  delight  students  further  by  subjecting \nmathematics  and  history,  as  well  as  English,  to  the  rigors  of  a \nrock  music  format.  In  fact,  this  is  not  Mr.  Henderson's  idea  at \nall. It  was  pioneered  by  the  Children's  Television  Workshop, \nwhose  television  show  \"Sesame  Street\"  is  an expensive  illustra-\ntion  of  the  idea  that  education  is  indistinguishable  from  enter-\ntainment.  Nonetheless,  Mr.  Henderson  has  a  point  in  his  favor. \nWhereas  \"Sesame  Street\"  merely  attempts  to  make  learning  to \nread  a  form  of light  entertainment,  the  Philadelphia experiment \naims  to  make  the  classroom  itself  into  a  rock  concert. \nIn New  Bedford,  Massachusetts,  a  rape  trial  was  televised,  to \nthe  delight  of  audiences  who  could  barely  tell  the  difference \nbetween  the  trial  and  their  favorite  mid-day  soap  opera.  In  Flor-\nida, trials  of  varying  degrees  of  seriousness,  including  murder, \nare regularly  televised  and  are  considered  to  be  more  entertain-\ning than  most  fictional  courtroom  dramas.  All  of this  is  done  in \nthe  interests  of  \"public  education.\"  For  the  same  high  purpose, \nplans  are  afoot,  it  is  rumored,  to  televise  confessionals.  To  be \ncalled  \"Secrets  of  the  Confessional  Box,\"  the  program  will,  of \ncourse,  carry  the  warning  that  some  of  its  material  may  be  of-\nfensive  to children  and  therefore  parental  guidance  is suggested."

    "raw_text": "The Age  of  Show  Business 95 \nOn a  United  Airlines  flight  from  Chicago  to  Vancouver,  a \nstewardess announces that its passengers will  play  a game. The \npassenger with  the most credit cards will  win  a bottle of cham-\npagne. A  man  from  Boston  with  twelve  credit  cards  wins.  A \nsecond game  requires the passengers to guess the collective  age \nof the cabin crew.  A man  from  Chicago  guesses 128,  and wins \nanother bottle  of  wine.  During  the  second  game,  the  air turns \nchoppy and the Fasten Seat Belt sign goes on. Very  few  people \nnotice, least of all the cabin crew,  who  keep  up a steady flow  of \ngags on  the  intercom.  When  the  plane  reaches its destination, \neveryone  seems  to  agree  that  it's  fun  to  fly  from  Chicago  to \nVancouver. \nOn February 7, 1985, The New York  Times reported that  Pro-\nfessor Charles Pine of Rutgers University  (Newark  campus)  was \nnamed Professor of  the Year by the Council for  the Support and \nAdvancement  of  Education.  In  explaining  why  he  has  such a \ngreat impact on his students, Professor Pine  said:  \"I  have  some \ngimmicks I use all the  time.  If you  reach  the end of  the  black-\nboard, I  keep  writing  on  the  wall.  It  always  gets a  laugh. The \nway I  show  what  a  glass molecule  does  is to run over  to  one \nwall and  bounce  off  it,  and  run  over  to  the  other  wall.\"  His \nstudents are,  perhaps,  too  young  to  recall  that  James Cagney \nused this  \"molecule  move\"  to  great  effect  in  Yankee  Doodle \nDandy. If I am not mistaken, Donald  O'Connor  duplicated  it in \nSingin' in  the Rain. So  far as I know,  it has been used only  once \nbefore in  a  classroom:  Hegel  tried  it  several  times  in  demon-\nstrating how  the dialectical method  works. \nThe Pennsylvania  Amish  try  to  live  in  isolation  from  main-\nstream American  culture.  Among  other  things,  their  religion \nopposes the veneration  of graven  images, which  means that the \nAmish are forbidden  to see movies  or to be photographed.  But \napparently their religion  has not got around to disallowing  see-\ning movies  when  they are  being photographed.

Although  the  Amish  were  warned  by \ntheir  church  not  to  interfere  with  the  film  makers,  it  turned  out \nthat  some  Amish  welders  ran  to  see  the  action  as  soon  as  their \nwork  was  done.  Other  devouts  lay  in  the  grass  some  distance \naway,  and  looked  down  on  the  set  with  binoculars.  \"We  read \nabout  the  movie  in  the  paper,\"  said  an  Amish  woman.  \"The \nkids even  cut  out  Harrison  Ford's  picture.\"  She  added:  \"But  it \ndoesn't  really  matter  that  much  to  them.  Somebody  told  us  he \nwas  in  Star  Wars  but  that  doesn't  mean  anything  to  us.\"3  The \nlast time  a  similar  conclusion  was  drawn  was  when  the  ex-\necutive  director  of  the  American  Association  of  Blacksmiths  re-\nmarked  that  he  had  read  about  the  automobile  but  that  he  was \nconvinced  it  would  have  no  consequences  for  the  future  of his \norganization. \nIn the  Winter,  1984,  issue  of  the  Official  Video  Journal there \nappears  a  full-page  advertisement  for  \"The  Genesis  Project.\" \nThe project  aims  to  convert  the  Bible  into  a series  of movies.  The \nend-product,  to  be  called  \"The  New  Media  Bible,\"  will  consist \nof 225  hours  of  film  and  will  cost  a  quarter  of  a  billion  dollars. \nProducer John  Heyman,  whose  credits  include  Saturday  Night \nFever and  Grease,  is  one  of  the  film  makers  most  committed  to \nthe  project.  \"Simply  stated,\"  he  is  quoted  as  saying,  \"I  got \nhooked  on  the  Bible.\"  The  famous  Israeli  actor  Topol,  best \nknown  for  his  role  as  Tevye  in  Fiddler  on the  Roof, will  play  the \nrole of  Abraham.  The  advertisement  does  not  say  who  will  star \nas God  but,  given  the  producer's  background,  there  is  some \nconcern  that  it  might  be  John  Travolta. \nAt the  commencement  exercises  at  Yale  University  in  1983, \nseveral  honorary  degrees  were  awarded,  including  one  to \nMother  Teresa.  As  she  and  other  humanitarians  and  scholars, \neach  in  turn,  received  their  awards,  the  audience  applauded  ap-\npropriately  but  with  a  slight  hint  of  reserve  and  impatience,  for \nit wished  to  give  its  heart  to  the  final  recipient  who  waited  shyly \nin the  wings.  As  the  details  of  her  achievements  were  being\n\f\nThe Age of Show Business 97 \nrecounted,  many  people  left  their  seats  and  surged  toward  the \nstage to  be  closer  to  the  great  woman.  And  when  the  name \nMeryl Streep  was  announced,  the  audience  unleashed  a  sonic \nboom of affection  to wake  the  New  Haven  dead.  One  man  who \nwas present  when  Bob  Hope received  his  honorary  doctorate  at \nanother  institution  said that  Dr. Streep's  applause  surpassed  Dr. \nHope's. Knowing  how  to  please  a crowd  as  well as anyone,  the \nintellectual  leaders  at  Yale  invited  Dick  Cavett,  the  talk-show \nhost, to deliver  the  commencement  address  the  following  year. \nIt is rumored  that  this  year, Don Rickles will receive  a Doctorate \nof Humane  Letters  and  Lola  Falana  will  give  the  commence-\nment address. \nPrior to  the  1984  presidential  elections,  the  two  candidates \nconfronted  each  other  on  television  in  what  were  called  \"de-\nbates.\"  These  events  were  not  in  the  least  like  the  Lincoln-\nDouglas debates  or  anything  else  that  goes  by  the  name.  Each \ncandidate  was  given  five minutes  to  address  such  questions  as, \nWhat is (or would  be)  your  policy  in Central  America?  His op-\nposite number  was  then  given  one  minute  for  a  rebuttal.  In \nsuch circumstances,  complexity,  documentation  and  logic  can \nplay no  role,  and,  indeed,  on  several  occasions  syntax  itself \nwas abandoned  entirely.  It  is  no  matter.  The  men  were  less \nconcerned  with  giving  arguments  than  with  \"giving  off\"  im-\npressions, which  is what  television  does  best.  Post-debate com-\nmentary  largely  avoided  any  evaluation  of  the  candidates' \nideas, since  there  were  none  to  evaluate.  Instead,  the  debates \nwere conceived  as  boxing  matches,  the  relevant  question  being, \nWho KO'd  whom?  The  answer  was  determined  by  the  \"style\" \nof the  men—how  they  looked,  fixed  their  gaze,  smiled,  and \ndelivered one-liners.  In the  second  debate,  President Reagan  got \noff a swell one-liner  when  asked  a  question  about  his  age.  The \nfollowing  day, several  newspapers  indicated  that  Ron  had  KO'd \nFritz with  his  joke. Thus,  the  leader  of the  free  world is  chosen \nby the people  in the  Age of Television. \nWhat all of this means  is that  our  culture  has  moved  toward  a\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to Death 98 \nnew  way  of  conducting  its  business,  especially  its  important \nbusiness.  The  nature  of its discourse  is changing  as  the  demarca-\ntion  line  between  what  is  show  business  and  what  is  not  be-\ncomes  harder  to  see  with  each  passing  day.  Our  priests  and \npresidents,  our  surgeons  and  lawyers,  our  educators  and  news-\ncasters  need  worry  less  about  satisfying  the  demands  of  their \ndiscipline  than  the  demands  of  good  showmanship.  Had  Irving \nBerlin  changed  one  word  in  the  title  of  his  celebrated  song,  he \nwould  have  been  as  prophetic,  albeit  more  terse,  as  Aldous \nHuxley.  He  need  only  have  written,  There's  No  Business  But \nShow  Business."

    "raw_text": "Amusing Ourselves  to Death 100 \noccupied  with  it  (let  us  say,  for  ninety  seconds),  and  that  you \nmust  now  give  your  attention  to  another  fragment  of news  or  a \ncommercial. \nTelevision  did  not  invent  the  \"Now  .  . . this\"  world  view.  As I \nhave  tried  to  show,  it  is the  offspring  of the  intercourse  between \ntelegraphy  and  photography.  But  it  is through  television  that  it \nhas been  nurtured  and  brought  to  a  perverse  maturity.  For  on \ntelevision,  nearly  every  half  hour  is  a discrete  event,  separated \nin content,  context,  and  emotional  texture  from  what  precedes \nand follows  it. In part  because  television  sells  its time  in seconds \nand minutes,  in  part  because  television  must  use  images  rather \nthan  words,  in  part  because  its  audience  can  move  freely  to and \nfrom  the  television  set,  programs  are  structured  so  that  almost \neach  eight-minute  segment  may  stand  as  a  complete  event  in \nitself. Viewers  are  rarely  required  to  carry  over  any  thought  or \nfeeling  from  one  parcel  of  time  to  another. \nOf course,  in  television's  presentation  of  the  \"news  of  the \nday,\"  we  may  see  the  \"Now  .  . . this\"  mode  of  discourse  in  its \nboldest  and  most  embarrassing  form.  For  there,  we  are  pre-\nsented  not  only  with  fragmented  news  but  news  without  con-\ntext,  without  consequences,  without  value,  and  therefore \nwithout  essential  seriousness;  that  is  to  say,  news  as  pure \nentertainment. \nConsider,  for  example,  how  you  would  proceed  if  you  were \ngiven  the  opportunity  to  produce  a  television  news  show  for \nany station  concerned  to  attract  the  largest  possible  audience. \nYou would,  first,  choose  a  cast  of  players,  each  of  whom  has  a \nface that  is  both  \"likable\"  and  \"credible.\"  Those  who  apply \nwould,  in  fact,  submit  to  you  their  eight-by-ten  glossies,  from \nwhich  you  would  eliminate  those  whose  countenances  are  not \nsuitable  for  nightly  display.  This  means  that  you  will  exclude \nwomen  who  are  not  beautiful  or  who  are  over  the  age  of  fifty, \nmen  who  are  bald,  all  people  who  are  overweight  or  whose \nnoses  are  too  long  or  whose  eyes  are  too  close  together.  You \nwill try,  in  other  words,  to  assemble  a  cast  of  talking  hair-do's.\n\f\n\"Now  . .  .  This\" 101 \nAt the  very  least,  you  will  want  those  whose  faces  would  not  be \nunwelcome  on  a  magazine  cover. \nChristine  Craft  has  just  such  a  face,  and  so  she  applied  for  a \nco-anchor  position  on  KMBC-TV  in Kansas  City.  According  to  a \nlawyer  who  represented  her  in  a  sexism  suit  she  later  brought \nagainst  the  station,  the  management  of  KMBC-TV  \"loved \nChristine's  look.\"  She  was  accordingly  hired  in  January  1981. \nShe was  fired  in  August  1981  because  research  indicated  that \nher appearance  \"hampered  viewer  acceptance.\"1  What  exactly \ndoes  \"hampered  viewer  acceptance\"  mean?  And  what  does  it \nhave  to  do  with  the  news?  Hampered  viewer  acceptance  means \nthe same  thing  for  television  news  as  it  does  for  any  television \nshow:  Viewers  do  not  like  looking  at  the  performer.  It  also \nmeans  that  viewers  do  not  believe  the  performer,  that  she  lacks \ncredibility.  In  the  case  of  a  theatrical  performance,  we  have  a \nsense  of  what  that  implies:  The  actor  does  not  persuade  the \naudience  that  he  or  she  is  the  character  being  portrayed.  But \nwhat  does  lack  of credibility  imply  in  the  case  of a news  show? \nWhat  character  is  a co-anchor  playing?  And  how  do  we  decide \nthat  the  performance  lacks  verisimilitude?  Does  the  audience \nbelieve  that  the  newscaster  is  lying,  that  what  is  reported \ndid not  in  fact  happen,  that  something  important  is  being \nconcealed? \nIt is frightening  to think  that  this  may  be  so,  that  the  percep-\ntion of  the  truth  of  a report  rests  heavily  on  the  acceptability  of \nthe newscaster.  In  the  ancient  world,  there  was  a  tradition  of \nbanishing  or  killing  the  bearer  of bad tidings.  Does  the  television \nnews  show  restore,  in a curious  form,  this  tradition?  Do  we ban-\nish those  who  tell  us  the  news  when  we  do  not  care  for  the  face \nof the  teller?  Does  television  countermand  the  warnings  we \nonce  received  about  the  fallacy  of the  ad  hominem  argument? \nIf the  answer  to  any  of  these  questions  is  even  a  qualified \n\"Yes,\"  then  here  is  an  issue  worthy  of  the  attention  of  epis-\ntemologists.  Stated  in  its  simplest  form,  it is that  television  pro-\nvides a  new  (or,  possibly,  restores  an  old)  definition  of  truth:\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to Death 102 \nThe credibility  of  the  teller  is  the  ultimate  test  of  the  truth  of  a \nproposition.  \"Credibility\"  here  does  not  refer  to the  past  record \nof the  teller  for  making  statements  that  have  survived  the  rigors \nof reality-testing.  It  refers  only  to  the  impression  of  sincerity, \nauthenticity,  vulnerability  or  attractiveness  (choose  one  or \nmore)  conveyed  by  the  actor/reporter. \nThis is a matter  of considerable  importance,  for  it goes beyond \nthe question  of  how  truth  is  perceived  on  television  news \nshows.  If on television,  credibility  replaces  reality  as  the  decisive \ntest of  truth-telling,  political  leaders  need  not  trouble  them-\nselves  very  much  with  reality  provided  that  their  performances \nconsistently  generate  a  sense  of verisimilitude.  I  suspect,  for  ex-\nample,  that  the  dishonor  that  now  shrouds  Richard  Nixon  re-\nsults not  from  the  fact  that  he  lied  but  that  on  television  he \nlooked  like  a  liar.  Which,  if  true,  should  bring  no  comfort  to \nanyone,  not  even  veteran  Nixon-haters.  For  the  alternative  pos-\nsibilities  are  that  one  may  look  like  a liar  but  be  telling  the  truth; \nor even  worse,  look  like  a truth-teller  but  in  fact  be lying. \nAs a producer  of  a  television  news  show,  you  would  be  well \naware  of these  matters  and  would  be  careful  to choose  your  cast \non the  basis  of  criteria  used  by  David  Merrick  and  other \nsuccessful  impresarios.  Like  them,  you  would  then  turn  your \nattention  to  staging  the  show  on  principles  that  maximize  en-\ntertainment  value.  You  would,  for  example,  select  a  musical \ntheme  for  the  show.  All  television  news  programs  begin,  end, \nand are  somewhere  in  between  punctuated  with  music.  I  have \nfound  very  few  Americans  who  regard  this  custom  as  peculiar, \nwhich  fact  I have  taken  as  evidence  for  the  dissolution  of  lines \nof demarcation  between  serious  public  discourse  and  entertain-\nment.  What  has  music  to  do  with  the  news?  Why  is  it there?  It \nis there,  I  assume,  for  the  same  reason  music  is  used  in  the \ntheater  and  films—to  create  a  mood  and  provide  a  leitmotif  for \nthe entertainment.  If  there  were  no  music—as  is  the  case  when \nany television  program  is  interrupted  for  a news  flash—viewers \nwould  expect  something  truly  alarming,  possibly  life-altering.\n\f\n\"Now  . .  .  This\" 103 \nBut as  long  as  the  music  is there  as  a frame  for  the  program,  the \nviewer  is comforted  to  believe  that  there  is nothing  to  be  greatly \nalarmed  about;  that,  in  fact,  the  events  that  are  reported  have  as \nmuch  relation  to  reality  as  do  scenes  in  a  play. \nThis perception  of  a  news  show  as  a  stylized  dramatic  per-\nformance  whose  content  has  been  staged  largely  to  entertain  is \nreinforced  by  several  other  features,  including  the  fact  that  the \naverage  length  of  any  story  is  forty-five  seconds.  While  brevity \ndoes  not  always  suggest  triviality,  in  this  case  it clearly  does.  It is \nsimply  not  possible  to  convey  a  sense  of  seriousness  about  any \nevent  if  its implications  are  exhausted  in  less  than  one  minute's \ntime.  In  fact,  it is quite  obvious  that  TV news  has  no  intention  of \nsuggesting  that  any  story  has  any  implications,  for  that  would \nrequire  viewers  to  continue  to  think  about  it  when  it  is  done \nand therefore  obstruct  their  attending  to  the  next  story  that \nwaits  panting  in  the  wings.  In  any  case,  viewers  are  not  pro-\nvided  with  much  opportunity  to  be  distracted  from  the  next \nstory since  in  all  likelihood  it  will  consist  of  some  film  footage. \nPictures have  little  difficulty  in overwhelming  words,  and  short-\ncircuiting  introspection.  As  a television  producer,  you  would  be \ncertain  to  give  both  prominence  and  precedence  to  any  event \nfor which  there  is  some  sort  of  visual  documentation.  A  sus-\npected  killer  being  brought  into  a  police  station,  the  angry  face \nof a cheated  consumer,  a  barrel  going  over  Niagara  Falls  (with  a \nperson  alleged  to  be  in  it),  the  President disembarking  from  a \nhelicopter  on  the  White  House  lawn—these  are  always  fasci-\nnating  or  amusing,  and  easily  satisfy  the  requirements  of  an  en-\ntertaining  show.  It  is,  of  course,  not  necessary  that  the  visuals \nactually  document  the  point  of  a story.  Neither  is  it necessary  to \nexplain  why  such  images  are  intruding  themselves  on  public \nconsciousness.  Film  footage  justifies  itself,  as  every  television \nproducer  well  knows. \nIt is  also  of  considerable  help  in  maintaining  a  high  level  of \nunreality  that  the  newscasters  do  not  pause  to  grimace  or  shiver \nwhen  they  speak  their  prefaces  or  epilogs  to  the  film  clips.  In-\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to Death 104 \ndeed,  many  newscasters  do  not  appear  to  grasp  the  meaning  of \nwhat  they  are  saying,  and  some  hold  to  a fixed  and  ingratiating \nenthusiasm  as  they  report  on  earthquakes,  mass  killings  and \nother  disasters.  Viewers  would  be  quite  disconcerted  by  any \nshow  of  concern  or  terror  on  the  part  of  newscasters.  Viewers, \nafter  all, are  partners  with  the  newscasters  in  the  \"Now  .  . . this\" \nculture,  and  they  expect  the  newscaster  to  play  out  his  or  her \nrole  as  a character  who  is  marginally  serious  but  who  stays  well \nclear  of  authentic  understanding.  The  viewers,  for  their  part, \nwill not  be  caught  contaminating  their  responses  with  a sense  of \nreality,  any  more  than  an  audience  at  a play  would  go  scurrying \nto call  home  because  a  character  on  stage  has  said  that  a  mur-\nderer  is  loose  in  the  neighborhood. \nThe viewers  also  know  that  no  matter  how  grave  any  frag-\nment  of  news  may  appear  (for  example,  on  the  day  I  write  a \nMarine  Corps  general  has  declared  that  nuclear  war  between \nthe United  States  and  Russia  is  inevitable),  it  will  shortly  be \nfollowed  by  a  series  of commercials  that  will,  in  an  instant,  de-\nfuse  the  import  of  the  news,  in  fact  render  it  largely  banal.  This \nis a key  element  in  the  structure  of  a  news  program  and  all  by \nitself refutes  any  claim  that  television  news  is  designed  as  a se-\nrious  form  of  public  discourse.  Imagine  what  you  would  think \nof me,  and  this  book,  if  I were  to  pause  here,  tell  you  that  I  will \nreturn  to  my  discussion  in  a moment,  and  then  proceed  to  write \na few  words  in  behalf  of  United  Airlines  or  the  Chase  Manhat-\ntan Bank.  You  would  rightly  think  that  I  had  no  respect  for  you \nand,  certainly,  no  respect  for  the  subject.  And  if  I  did  this  not \nonce  but  several  times  in  each  chapter,  you  would  think  the \nwhole  enterprise  unworthy  of  your  attention.  Why,  then,  do  we \nnot think  a  news  show  similarly  unworthy?  The  reason,  I  be-\nlieve,  is  that  whereas  we  expect  books  and  even  other  media \n(such  as  film)  to  maintain  a  consistency  of tone  and  a continuity \nof content,  we  have  no  such  expectation  of television,  and  espe-\ncially television  news.  We  have  become  so  accustomed  to  its \ndiscontinuities  that  we  are  no  longer  struck  dumb,  as  any  sane"

The  damage  is  especially  massive  to  youthful \nviewers  who  depend  so  much  on  television  for  their  clues  as  to \nhow  to  respond  to  the  world.

But  television  has  exacted  its  price  for  MacNeil's  re-\njection  of  a  show  business  format.  By  television's  standards, \nthe audience  is  minuscule,  the  program  is  confined  to  public-\ntelevision  stations,  and  it  is  a  good  guess  that  the  combined \nsalary  of MacNeil  and  Lehrer  is one-fifth  of Dan  Rather's  or Tom \nBrokaw's. \nIf you  were  a  producer  of  a  television  news  show  for  a com-\nmercial  station,  you  would  not  have  the  option  of  defying  tele-\nvision's  requirements.  It  would  be  demanded  of  you  that  you \nstrive  for  the  largest  possible  audience,  and,  as  a  consequence \nand in  spite  of your  best  intentions,  you  would  arrive  at  a  pro-\nduction  very  nearly  resembling  MacNeil's  description.

You  would  advertise  the  show,  both  in  the  press  and  on \ntelevision  itself.  You  would  do  \"news  briefs,\"  to  serve  as  an \ninducement  to  viewers.  You  would  have  a  weatherman  as \ncomic  relief,  and  a  sportscaster  whose  language  is  a touch  un-\ncouth  (as  a  way  of  his  relating  to  the  beer-drinking  common \nman).

Much  depends  here,  of  course,  on  what  is \nmeant  by  being  informed.  I  will  pass  over  the  now  tiresome \npolls that  tell  us  that,  at  any  given  moment,  70  percent  of  our \ncitizens  do  not  know  who  is  the  Secretary  of  State  or  the  Chief \nJustice  of  the  Supreme  Court.

Or  knows  who  the \nShah  was,  and  where  he  came  from? \nNonetheless,  everyone  had  an  opinion  about  this  event,  for  in \nAmerica  everyone  is  entitled  to  an  opinion,  and  it  is  certainly \nuseful  to  have  a  few  when  a  pollster  shows  up.  But  these \nare opinions  of  a  quite  different  order  from  eighteenth-  or \nnineteenth-century  opinions.  It  is  probably  more  accurate  to \ncall them  emotions  rather  than  opinions,  which  would  account \nfor the fact  that  they  change  from  week  to  week,  as  the  pollsters \ntell us.  What  is  happening  here  is  that  television  is  altering  the \nmeaning  of  \"being  informed\"  by  creating  a  species  of  informa-\ntion that  might  properly  be  called  disinformation. I  am using  this \nword  almost  in  the  precise  sense  in  which  it  is used  by  spies  in \nthe CIA  or  KGB.  Disinformation  does  not  mean  false  informa-\ntion.  It  means  misleading  information—misplaced,  irrelevant, \nfragmented  or  superficial  information—information  that  cre-\nates the  illusion  of  knowing  something  but  which  in  fact  leads \none  away  from  knowing.  In  saying  this,  I do not  mean  to  imply \nthat  television  news  deliberately  aims  to  deprive  Americans  of a \ncoherent,  contextual  understanding  of  their  world.  I  mean  to \nsay that  when  news  is  packaged  as  entertainment,  that  is  the \ninevitable  result.  And  in  saying  that  the  television  news  show \nentertains  but  does  not  inform,  I am saying  something  far  more \nserious  than  that  we  are  being  deprived  of  authentic  informa-\ntion.  I am saying  we  are  losing  our  sense  of what  it  means  to  be\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to Death 108 \nwell informed.  Ignorance  is  always  correctable.  But  what  shall \nWe do  if  we  take  ignorance  to  be  knowledge? \nHere  is  a startling  example  of  how  this  process  bedevils  us.  A \nNew York  Times  article  is  headlined  on  February  15,  1983: \nREAGAN  MISSTATEMENTS  GETTING  LESS  ATTENTION \nThe article  begins  in  the  following  way: \nPresident Reagan's  aides  used  to  become  visibly alarmed  at  sug-\ngestions that  he  had  given  mangled  and  perhaps  misleading  ac-\ncounts of his policies or of current  events  in general. That doesn't \nseem to happen  much  anymore. \nIndeed, the  President continues  to make  debatable  assertions of \nfact but  news  accounts  do  not  deal  with  them  as  extensively  as \nthey once  did. In the  view of White House officials, the  declining \nnews coverage mirrors a decline in interest by the general public, (my \nitalics) \nThis report  is  not  so  much  a  news  story  as  a  story  about  the \nnews,  and  our  recent  history  suggests  that  it  is not  about  Ronald \nReagan's  charm.  It  is  about  how  news  is  defined,  and  I  believe \nthe  story  would  be  quite  astonishing  to  both  civil  libertarians \nand  tyrants  of  an  earlier  time.  Walter  Lippmann,  for  example, \nwrote  in  1920:  \"There  can  be  no  liberty  for  a community  which \nlacks  the  means  by  which  to  detect  lies.\"  For  all  of  his  pessi-\nmism  about  the  possibilities  of  restoring  an  eighteenth-  and \nnineteenth-century  level  of  public  discourse,  Lippmann  as-\nsumed,  as  did  Thomas  Jefferson  before  him,  that  with  a  well-\ntrained  press  functioning  as  a  lie-detector,  the  public's  interest \nin a  President's mangling  of  the  truth  would  be  piqued,  in  both \nsenses  of  that  word.  Given  the  means  to  detect  lies,  he  believed, \nthe  public  could  not  be  indifferent  to  their  consequences. \nBut this  case  refutes  his  assumption.  The  reporters  who  cover \nthe  White  House  are  ready  and  able  to  expose  lies,  and  thus\n\f\n\"Now  . .  .  This\" 109 \ncreate  the  grounds  for  informed  and  indignant  opinion.  But  ap-\nparently  the  public  declines  to  take  an  interest.  To  press  reports \nof White  House  dissembling,  the  public  has  replied  with  Queen \nVictoria's  famous  line:  \"We  are  not  amused.\"  However,  here \nthe  words  mean  something  the  Queen  did  not  have  in  mind. \nThey mean  that  what  is  not  amusing  does  not  compel  their  at-\ntention.  Perhaps if  the  President's lies  could  be  demonstrated  by \npictures  and  accompanied  by  music  the  public  would  raise  a \ncurious  eyebrow.  If  a  movie,  like  All  the  President's  Men,  could \nbe made  from  his  misleading  accounts  of  government  policy,  if \nthere  were  a  break-in  of  some  sort  or  sinister  characters  laun-\ndering  money,  attention  would  quite  likely  be  paid.  We  do  well \nto remember  that  President Nixon  did  not  begin  to  come  un-\ndone  until  his  lies  were  given  a  theatrical  setting  at  the  Water-\ngate  hearings.  But  we  do  not  have  anything  like  that  here. \nApparently,  all  President Reagan  does  is  say things  that  are  not \nentirely  true.  And  there  is  nothing  entertaining  in  that. \nBut there  is  a  subtler  point  to  be  made  here.  Many  of  the \nPresident's \"misstatements\"  fall  in  the  category  of  contradic-\ntions—mutually  exclusive  assertions  that  cannot  possibly  both, \nin the  same  context,  be  true.  \"In  the  same  context\"  is  the  key \nphrase  here,  for  it is context  that  defines  contradiction.  There  is \nno problem  in  someone's  remarking  that  he  prefers  oranges  to \napples,  and  also  remarking  that  he  prefers  apples  to  oranges— \nnot  if  one  statement  is  made  in  the  context  of  choosing  a  wall-\npaper  design  and  the  other  in  the  context  of  selecting  fruit  for \ndessert.  In  such  a  case,  we  have  statements  that  are  opposites, \nbut not  contradictory.  But  if the  statements  are  made  in  a single, \ncontinuous,  and  coherent  context,  then  they  are  contradictions, \nand  cannot  both  be  true.  Contradiction,  in  short,  requires  that \nstatements  and  events  be  perceived  as  interrelated  aspects  of  a \ncontinuous  and  coherent  context.  Disappear  the  context,  or \nfragment  it, and  contradiction  disappears.  This  point  is  nowhere \nmade  more  clear  to  me  than  in  conferences  with  my  younger \nstudents  about  their  writing.  \"Look  here,\"  I  say.  \"In  this  para-\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to Death 110 \ngraph  you  have  said  one  thing.  And  in  that  you  have  said  the \nopposite.  Which  is  it to be?\"  They  are  polite,  and  wish  to  please, \nbut they  are  as  baffled  by the  question  as  I am by  the  response. \n\"I know,\"  they  will  say,  \"but  that  is  there and  this  is here.\" The \ndifference  between  us  is  that  I  assume  \"there\"  and  \"here,\" \n\"now\"  and  \"then,\"  one  paragraph  and  the  next  to  be  con-\nnected,  to  be  continuous,  to  be  part  of the  same  coherent  world \nof thought.  That  is the  way  of typographic  discourse,  and  typog-\nraphy  is  the  universe  I'm  \"coming  from,\"  as they  say.  But  they \nare coming  from  a different  universe  of discourse  altogether:  the \n\"Now  .  .  .  this\"  world  of  television.  The  fundamental  assump-\ntion  of  that  world  is  not  coherence  but  discontinuity.  And  in  a \nworld  of  discontinuities,  contradiction  is  useless  as  a  test  of \ntruth  or  merit,  because  contradiction  does  not  exist. \nMy point  is  that  we  are  by now  so  thoroughly  adjusted  to  the \n\"Now  .  .  .  this\"  world  of  news—a  world  of  fragments,  where \nevents  stand  alone,  stripped  of  any  connection  to  the  past,  or  to \nthe future,  or  to  other  events—that  all  assumptions  of  co-\nherence  have  vanished.  And  so,  perforce,  has  contradiction.  In \nthe context  of  no context, so  to  speak,  it  simply  disappears.  And \nin its  absence,  what  possible  interest  could  there  be  in  a  list  of \nwhat  the  President  says  now and  what  he  said  then?  It is merely \na rehash  of  old  news,  and  there  is  nothing  interesting  or  enter-\ntaining  in  that.  The  only  thing  to  be  amused  about  is  the  baffle-\nment  of  reporters  at  the  public's  indifference.  There  is  an  irony \nin the  fact  that  the  very  group  that  has  taken  the  world  apart \nshould,  on  trying  to  piece  it together  again,  be  surprised  that  no \none  notices  much,  or  cares. \nFor all  his  perspicacity,  George  Orwell  would  have  been \nstymied  by  this  situation;  there  is nothing  \"Orwellian\"  about  it. \nThe President  does  not  have  the  press  under  his  thumb.  The  New \nYork Times  and  The  Washington  Post  are  not  Pravda;  the  Associ-\nated  Press  is not  Tass.  And  there  is no Newspeak  here.  Lies have \nnot been  defined  as  truth  nor  truth  as  lies.  All  that  has  hap-\npened  is  that  the  public  has  adjusted  to  incoherence  and  been\n\f\n\"Now  . .  .  This\" 111 \namused  into  indifference.  Which  is  why  Aldous  Huxley  would \nnot in  the  least  be  surprised  by  the  story.  Indeed,  he  prophesied \nits coming.  He  believed  that  it is far more  likely  that  the  Western \ndemocracies  will  dance  and  dream  themselves  into  oblivion \nthan  march  into  it,  single  file and  manacled.  Huxley  grasped,  as \nOrwell  did  not,  that  it  is not  necessary  to  conceal  anything  from \na public  insensible  to  contradiction  and  narcoticized  by  tech-\nnological  diversions.  Although  Huxley  did  not  specify  that  tele-\nvision  would  be  our  main  line  to  the  drug,  he  would  have  no \ndifficulty  accepting  Robert  MacNeil's  observation  that  \"Televi-\nsion is  the  soma  of  Aldous  Huxley's  Brave  New  World.\"  Big \nBrother  turns  out  to  be  Howdy  Doody. \nI do  not  mean  that  the  trivialization  of  public  information  is \nall accomplished  on  television.  I  mean  that  television  is  the  par-\nadigm  for  our  conception  of  public  information.  As the  printing \npress did in  an  earlier  time,  television  has  achieved  the  power  to \ndefine  the  form  in  which  news  must  come,  and  it  has  also  de-\nfined how  we  shall  respond  to  it. In presenting  news  to  us  pack-\naged as  vaudeville,  television  induces  other  media  to  do  the \nsame,  so  that  the  total  information  environment  begins  to  mir-\nror television. \nFor example,  America's  newest  and  highly  successful  na-\ntional  newspaper,  USA  Today,  is  modeled  precisely  on  the  for-\nmat of  television.  It  is sold on  the  street  in  receptacles  that  look \nlike television  sets.  Its  stories  are  uncommonly  short,  its  design \nleans  heavily  on  pictures,  charts  and  other  graphics,  some  of \nthem  printed  in  various  colors.  Its  weather  maps  are  a  visual \ndelight;  its  sports  section  includes  enough  pointless  statistics  to \ndistract  a  computer.  As  a  consequence,  USA  Today,  which  be-\ngan publication  in  September  1982,  has  become  the  third \nlargest daily  in  the  United  States  (as  of July  1984,  according  to \nthe Audit  Bureau  of  Circulations),  moving  quickly  to  overtake \nthe Daily News and  the  Wall  Street Journal. Journalists  of  a more \ntraditional  bent  have  criticized  it  for  its  superficiality  and  the-\natrics,  but  the  paper's  editors  remain  steadfast  in  their  disregard\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to Death 112 \nof typographic  standards.  The  paper's  Editor-in-Chief,  John \nQuinn,  has  said:  \"We  are  not  up  to  undertaking  projects  of the \ndimensions  needed  to  win  prizes.  They  don't  give  awards  for \nthe best  investigative  paragraph.\"4  Here  is  an  astonishing  trib-\nute to  the  resonance  of  television's  epistemology:  In  the  age  of \ntelevision,  the  paragraph  is  becoming  the  basic  unit  of  news  in \nprint  media.  Moreover,  Mr.  Quinn  need  not  fret  too  long  about \nbeing  deprived  of  awards.  As  other  newspapers  join  in  the \ntransformation,  the  time  cannot  be  far  off when  awards  will  be \ngiven  for  the  best  investigative  sentence. \nIt needs  also  to  be  noted  here  that  new  and  successful  maga-\nzines  such  as  People  and  Us  are  not  only  examples  of  television-\noriented  print  media  but  have  had  an  extraordinary  \"ricochet\" \neffect  on  television  itself.  Whereas  television  taught  the  maga-\nzines  that  news  is  nothing  but  entertainment,  the  magazines \nhave  taught  television  that  nothing  but  entertainment  is  news. \nTelevision  programs,  such  as  \"Entertainment  Tonight,\"  turn  in-\nformation  about  entertainers  and  celebrities  into  \"serious\"  cul-\ntural  content,  so  that  the  circle  begins  to  close:  Both  the  form \nand  content  of  news  become  entertainment. \nRadio,  of  course,  is  the  least  likely  medium  to  join  in  the  de-\nscent  into  a  Huxleyan  world  of  technological  narcotics.  It  is, \nafter  all, particularly  well  suited  to  the  transmission  of  rational, \ncomplex  language.  Nonetheless,  and  even  if  we  disregard  ra-\ndio's  captivation  by  the  music  industry,  we  appear  to  be  left \nwith  the  chilling  fact  that  such  language  as  radio  allows  us  to \nhear  is  increasingly  primitive,  fragmented,  and  largely  aimed  at \ninvoking  visceral  response;  which  is  to  say,  it  is  the  linguistic \nanalogue  to  the  ubiquitous  rock  music  that  is  radio's  principal \nsource  of income.  As  I write,  the  trend  in  call-in  shows  is for the \n\"host\"  to  insult  callers  whose  language  does  not,  in  itself,  go \nmuch  beyond  humanoid  grunting.  Such  programs  have  little \ncontent,  as  this  word  used  to  be  defined,  and  are  merely  of  ar-\ncheological  interest  in  that  they  give  us  a  sense  of  what  a  di-\nalogue  among  Neanderthals  might  have  been  like.  More  to  the\n\f\n\"Now . .  .  This\" 113 \npoint,  the  language  of  radio  newscasts  has  become,  under  the \ninfluence  of  television,  increasingly  decontextualized  and  dis-\ncontinuous,  so  that  the  possibility  of  anyone's  knowing  about \nthe world,  as  against  merely  knowing  of  it,  is  effectively \nblocked.  In  New  York  City,  radio  station  WINS  entreats  its  lis-\nteners  to  \"Give  us  twenty-two  minutes  and  we'll  give  you  the \nworld.\"  This  is  said  without  irony,  and  its  audience,  we  may \nassume,  does  not  regard  the  slogan  as  the  conception  of  a  dis-\nordered  mind. \nAnd so,  we  move  rapidly  into  an  information  environment \nwhich  may  rightly  be  called  trivial  pursuit.  As  the  game  of  that \nname  uses  facts  as a source  of amusement,  so  do  our  sources  of \nnews.  It  has  been  demonstrated  many  times  that  a  culture  can \nsurvive  misinformation  and  false  opinion.  It  has  not  yet  been \ndemonstrated  whether  a  culture  can  survive  if it takes  the  mea-\nsure  of  the  world  in  twenty-two  minutes.  Or  if  the  value  of  its \nnews  is  determined  by  the  number  of  laughs  it  provides.\n\f\nShuffle Off to Bethlehem \nThere is  an  evangelical  preacher  on  television  who  goes  by the \nname  of  Reverend  Terry.  She  appears  to  be  in  her  early  fifties, \nand features  a coiffure  of which  it has been  said that  it cannot  be \nmussed,  only  broken.  Reverend  Terry  is  energetic  and  folksy, \nand uses  a  style  of  preaching  modeled  on  early  Milton  Berle. \nWhen  her  audiences  are  shown  in  reaction  shots,  they  are  al-\nmost always  laughing.  As a consequence,  it  would  be  difficult  to \ndistinguish  them  from  audiences,  say,  at the  Sands  Hotel  in  Las \nVegas, except  for  the fact  that they  have  a slightly cleaner,  more \nwholesome  look.  Reverend  Terry tries to persuade  them,  as well \nas those  \"at  home,\"  to  change  their  ways  by  finding  Jesus \nChrist. To  help  her  do  this,  she  offers  a \"prosperity  Campaign \nKit,\"  which  appears  to  have  a  dual  purpose:  As  it  brings  one \nnearer  to  Jesus,  it also provides  advice  on how  to  increase  one's \nbank  account.  This  makes  her  followers  extremely  happy  and \nconfirms  their  predisposition  to  believe  that  prosperity  is  the \ntrue  aim  of  religion.  Perhaps God disagrees.  As  of this  writing, \nReverend  Terry  has  been  obliged  to  declare  bankruptcy  and \ntemporarily  halt  her  ministrations. \nPat Robertson  is  the  master  of  ceremonies  of  the  highly  suc-\ncessful  \"700  Club,\"  a  television  show  and  religious  organiza-\ntion of  sorts  to  which  you  can  belong  by  paying  fifteen  dollars \nper month.  (Of  course,  anyone  with  cable  television  can  watch \nthe show  free  of charge.)  Reverend  Robertson  does  his  act in  a \nmuch  lower  register  than  Reverend  Terry.  He is modest,  intelli-\ngent, and  has  the  kind  of  charm  television  viewers  would  asso-\n114 \n8."

His  appeal  to  godliness \nis considerably  more  sophisticated  than  Reverend  Terry's,  at \nleast from  the  standpoint  of  television.  Indeed,  he  appears  to \nuse as  his  model  of  communication  \"Entertainment  Tonight.\" \nHis program  includes  interviews,  singers  and  taped  segments \nwith  entertainers  who  are  born-again  Christians.  For  example, \nall of the  chorus  girls  in  Don  Ho's  Hawaiian  act  are  born-again, \nand in  one  segment,  we  are  shown  them  both  at  prayer  and  on \nstage (although  not  at  the  same  time).  The  program  also  in-\ncludes  taped  reenactments  of  people  who,  having  been  driven \nto the  edge  of  despair,  are  saved  by  the  700  Club.  Such  people \nplay themselves  in  these  finely  crafted  docu-dramas.  In  one,  we \nare shown  a  woman  racked  with  anxiety.  She  cannot  concen-\ntrate  on  her  wifely  duties.  The  television  shows  and  movies  she \nsees induce  a  generalized  fear  of the  world.  Paranoia closes  in. \nShe even  begins  to  believe  that  her  own  children  are  trying  to \nkill her.  As  the  play  proceeds,  we  see  her  in  front  of her  televi-\nsion set  chancing  upon  the  700  Club.  She  becomes  interested  in \nits message.  She  allows  Jesus  to  enter  her  heart.  She  is saved.  At \nthe end  of  the  play,  we  see  her  going  about  her  business,  calmly \nand cheerfully,  her  eyes  illuminated  with  peace.  And  so,  we \nmay say  that  the  700  Club  has  twice  elevated  her  to  a  state  of \ntranscendence:  first,  by  putting  her  in  the  presence  of  Jesus; \nsecond,  by  making  her  into  a television  star.  To the  uninitiated, \nit is not  entirely  clear  which  is  the  higher  estate. \nToward  the  end  of  each  700  Club  show,  the  following  day's \nacts are  announced.  They  are  many  and  various.  The  program \nconcludes  with  someone's  saying,  \"AH  this  and  more  .  .  .  to-\nmorrow  on  the  700  Club.\" \nJimmy  Swaggart  is  a  somewhat  older-style  evangelist. \nThough  he  plays  the  piano  quite  well,  sings  sweetly,  and  uses \nthe full  range  of  television's  resources,  when  he  gets  going  he \nfavors  a kind  of  fire-and-brimstone  approach.  But  because  this \nis television,  he  often  moderates  his  message  with  a  dollop  of \necumenism.  For  example,  his  sermon  on  the  question,  Are  the"

    "raw_text": "Amusing Ourselves  to Death 116 \nJews  practicing  blasphemy?  begins  by  assuring  his  audience \nthat  they  are  not,  by  recalling  Jesus'  bar  mitzvah,  and  by  insist-\ning that  Christians  owe  the  Jews  a  considerable  debt.  It  ends \nwith  his  indicating  that  with  the  loss  of their  Temple  in  Biblical \ntimes,  the  Jews  have  somehow  lost  their  way.  His  message  sug-\ngests that  they  are  rather  to  be  pitied  than  despised  but  that,  in \nany case,  many  of  them  are  pretty  nice  people. \nIt is the  perfect  television  sermon—theatrical,  emotional,  and \nin a  curious  way  comforting,  even  to  a Jewish  viewer.  For  tele-\nvision—bless  its  heart—is  not  congenial  to  messages  of  naked \nhate.  For  one  thing,  you  never  know  who  is  watching,  so  it  is \nbest not  to  be  wildly  offensive.  For  another,  haters  with  red-\ndened  faces  and  demonic  gestures  merely  look  foolish  on televi-\nsion,  as  Marshall  McLuhan  observed  years  ago  and  Senator \nJoseph  McCarthy  learned  to  his  dismay.  Television  favors \nmoods  of  conciliation  and  is  at  its  best  when  substance  of  any \nkind  is  muted.  (One  must  make  an  exception  here  for  those \ninstances  when  preachers,  like  Swaggart,  turn  to  the  subject  of \nthe Devil  and  secular  humanism.  Then  they  are  quite  uncom-\npromising  in  the  ferocity  of  their  assaults,  partly,  one  may  as-\nsume,  because  neither  the  Devil  nor  secular  humanists  are \nincluded  in  the  Nielsen  Ratings.  Neither  are  they  inclined  to \nwatch.) \nThere  are  at  present  thirty-five  television  stations  owned  and \noperated  by  religious  organizations,  but  every  television  station \nfeatures  religious  programming  of  one  sort  or  another.  To  pre-\npare  myself  for  writing  this  chapter,  I  watched  forty-two  hours \nof television's  version  of  religion,  mostly  the  shows  of  Robert \nSchuller,  Oral  Roberts,  Jimmy  Swaggart,  Jerry  Falwell,  Jim \nBakker  and  Pat Robertson.  Forty-two  hours  were  entirely  un-\nnecessary.  Five  would  have  provided  me  with  all  the  conclu-\nsions,  of  which  there  are  two,  that  are  fairly  to be  drawn. \nThe first  is  that  on  television,  religion,  like  everything  else,  is \npresented,  quite  simply  and  without  apology,  as  an  entertain-\nment.  Everything  that  makes  religion  an  historic,  profound  and\n\f\nShuffle Off  to Bethlehem 117 \nsacred  human  activity  is  stripped  away;  there  is  no  ritual,  no \ndogma,  no  tradition,  no  theology,  and  above  all,  no  sense  of \nspiritual  transcendence.  On  these  shows,  the  preacher  is  tops. \nGod comes  out  as  second  banana. \nThe second  conclusion  is  that  this  fact  has  more  to  do  with \nthe bias  of  television  than  with  the  deficiencies  of  these  elec-\ntronic  preachers,  as  they  are  called.  It  is true  enough  that  some \nof these  men  are  uneducated,  provincial  and  even  bigoted.  They \ncertainly  do  not  compare  favorably  with  well-known  evan-\ngelicals of an  earlier  period,  such  as  Jonathan  Edwards,  George \nWhitefield  and  Charles  Finney,  who  were  men  of  great  learn-\ning, theological  subtlety  and  powerful  expositional  skills.  None-\ntheless,  today's  television  preachers  are  probably  not  greatly \ndifferent  in  their  limitations  from  most  earlier  evangelicals  or \nfrom  many  ministers  today  whose  activities  are  confined  to \nchurches  and  synagogues.  What  makes  these  television  preach-\ners the  enemy  of religious  experience  is not  so  much  their  weak-\nnesses  but  the  weaknesses  of  the  medium  in  which  they  work. \nMost Americans,  including  preachers,  have  difficulty  accept-\ning the  truth,  if  they  think  about  it  at  all,  that  not  all  forms  of \ndiscourse  can  be  converted  from  one  medium  to  another.  It  is \nnaive  to  suppose  that  something  that  has  been  expressed  in  one \nform  can  be  expressed  in  another  without  significantly  chang-\ning its  meaning,  texture  or  value.  Much  prose  translates  fairly \nwell from  one  language  to  another,  but  we  know  that  poetry \ndoes not;  we  may  get  a  rough  idea  of  the  sense  of  a  translated \npoem  but  usually  everything  else  is  lost,  especially  that  which \nmakes  it  an  object  of  beauty.  The  translation  makes  it  into \nsomething  it  was  not.  To  take  another  example:  We  may  find  it \nconvenient  to  send  a  condolence  card  to  a  bereaved  friend,  but \nwe delude  ourselves  if  we  believe  that  our  card  conveys  the \nsame  meaning  as  our  broken  and  whispered  words  when  we \nare present.  The  card  not  only  changes  the  words  but  eliminates \nthe context  from  which  the  words  take  their  meaning.  Sim-\nilarly, we  delude  ourselves  if we  believe  that  most  everything  a"

Perhaps some  things  can,  but  there  is  al-\nways  the  question,  What  is  lost  in  the  translation?  The  answer \nmay  even  be:  Everything  that  is  significant  about  education. \nThough  it  may  be  un-American  to  say  it,  not  everything  is \ntelevisible. Or  to  put  it  more  precisely,  what  is  televised  is  trans-\nformed  from  what  it  was  to  something  else,  which  may  or  may \nnot  preserve  its  former  essence.  For  the  most  part,  television \npreachers  have  not  seriously  addressed  this  matter.  They  have \nassumed  that  what  had  formerly  been  done  in  a  church  or  a \ntent,  and  face-to-face,  can  be  done  on  television  without  loss  of \nmeaning,  without  changing  the  quality  of  the  religious  experi-\nence.  Perhaps their  failure  to address  the  translation  issue  has  its \norigin  in  the  hubris  engendered  by  the  dazzling  number  of  peo-\nple to  whom  television  gives  them  access. \n\"Television,\"  Billy  Graham  has  written,  \"is  the  most  power-\nful tool  of  communication  ever  devised  by  man.  Each  of  my \nprime-time  'specials'  is  now  carried  by  nearly  300  stations \nacross  the  U.S.  and  Canada,  so  that  in  a  single  telecast  I  preach \nto millions  more  than  Christ  did  in  his  lifetime.\"1  To  this,  Pat \nRobertson  adds:  \"To  say  that  the  church  shouldn't  be  involved \nwith  television  is  utter  folly.  The  needs  are  the  same,  the  mes-\nsage is  the  same,  but  the  delivery  can  change.  .  .  .  It would  be \nfolly  for  the  church  not  to  get  involved  with  the  most  formative \nforce  in  America.\"2 \nThis is  gross  technological  naivete.  If  the  delivery  is  not  the \nsame,  then  the  message,  quite  likely,  is  not  the  same.  And  if  the \ncontext  in  which  the  message  is  experienced  is  altogether  differ-\nent  from  what  it  was  in  Jesus'  time,  we  may  assume  that  its \nsocial  and  psychological  meaning  is  different,  as well. \nTo come  to  the  point,  there  are  several  characteristics  of  tele-\nvision  and  its  surround  that  converge  to  make  authentic  reli-\ngious  experience  impossible.  The  first  has  to  do  with  the  fact \nthat  there  is  no  way  to  consecrate  the  space  in  which  a  televi-\nsion  show  is  experienced.  It  is an  essential  condition  of  any  tra-\n\f\nShuffle Off  to Bethlehem 119 \nditional  religious  service  that  the  space  in  which  it  is conducted \nmust  be  invested  with  some  measure  of  sacrality.  Of  course,  a \nchurch  or  synagogue  is  designed  as  a  place  of  ritual  enactment \nso that  almost  anything  that  occurs  there,  even  a  bingo  game, \nhas a religious  aura.  But  a  religious  service  need  not  occur  only \nin a church  or  synagogue.  Almost  any  place  will  do,  provided  it \nis first decontaminated;  that  is,  divested  of  its profane  uses.  This \ncan be  done  by  placing  a  cross  on  a  wall,  or  candles  on  a  table, \nor a sacred  document  in  public  view.  Through  such  acts,  a gym-\nnasium  or  dining  hall  or  hotel  room  can  be  transformed  into  a \nplace of worship;  a  slice  of space-time  can  be  removed  from  the \nworld  of  profane  events,  and  be  recreated  into  a  reality  that \ndoes not  belong  to  our  world.  But  for  this  transformation  to  be \nmade,  it  is  essential  that  certain  rules  of  conduct  be  observed. \nThere  will  be  no  eating  or  idle  conversation,  for  example.  One \nmay be  required  to  put  on  a  skull  cap  or  to  kneel  down  at  ap-\npropriate  moments.  Or  simply  to  contemplate  in  silence.  Our \nconduct  must  be  congruent  with  the  otherworldliness  of  the \nspace.  But  this  condition  is  not  usually  met  when  we  are  watch-\ning a  religious  television  program.  The  activities  in  one's  living \nroom  or  bedroom  or—God  help  us—one's  kitchen  are  usually \nthe same  whether  a  religious  program  is  being  presented  or \n\"The  A-Team\"  or  \"Dallas\"  is  being  presented.  People will  eat, \ntalk, go  to  the  bathroom,  do  push-ups  or  any  of  the  things  they \nare accustomed  to  doing  in  the  presence  of  an  animated  televi-\nsion screen.  If  an  audience  is  not  immersed  in  an  aura  of  mys-\ntery and  symbolic  otherworldliness,  then  it  is  unlikely  that  it \ncan call forth  the  state  of mind  required  for  a nontrivial  religious \nexperience. \nMoreover,  the  television  screen  itself  has  a strong  bias  toward \na psychology  of  secularism.  The  screen  is  so saturated  with  our \nmemories  of profane  events,  so  deeply  associated  with  the  com-\nmercial  and  entertainment  worlds  that  it  is  difficult  for  it to  be \nrecreated  as  a frame  for  sacred  events.  Among  other  things,  the \nviewer  is  at  all  times  aware  that  a  flick  of  the  switch  will  pro-"

Not  only  that,  but  both  prior  to \nand immediately  following  most  religious  programs,  there  are \ncommercials,  promos  for  popular  shows,  and  a  variety  of  other \nsecular  images  and  discourses,  so  that  the  main  message  of  the \nscreen  itself  is  a  continual  promise  of  entertainment.  Both  the \nhistory  and  the  ever-present  possibilities  of the  television  screen \nwork  against  the  idea  that  introspection  or  spiritual  transcen-\ndence  is  desirable  in  its  presence.  The  television  screen  wants \nyou to  remember  that  its  imagery  is  always  available  for  your \namusement  and  pleasure. \nThe television  preachers  themselves  are  well  aware  of  this. \nThey know  that  their  programs  do  not  represent  a  discontinuity \nin commercial  broadcasting  but  are  merely  part  of an  unbroken \ncontinuum.  Indeed,  many  of  these  programs  are  presented  at \ntimes  other  than  traditional  Sunday  hours.  Some  of  the  more \npopular  preachers  are  quite  willing  to  go  \"head  to  head\"  with \nsecular  programs  because  they  believe  they  can  put  on  a  more \nappealing  show.  Incidentally,  the  money  to  do  this  is  no  prob-\nlem. Contributions  to  these  shows  run  into  the  millions.  It  has \nbeen  estimated  that  the  total  revenue  of  the  electric  church  ex-\nceeds  $500  million  a  year. \nI mention  this  only  to  indicate  why  it  is  possible  for  these \npreachers  to  match  the  high  production  costs  of  any  strictly \ncommercial  program.  And  match  them  they  do.  Most  of  the \nreligious  shows  feature  sparkling  fountains,  floral  displays,  cho-\nral groups  and  elaborate  sets.  All of them  take  as  their  model  for \nstaging  some  well-known  commercial  program.  Jim  Bakker,  for \nexample,  uses  \"The  Merv  Griffin  Show\"  as  his  guide.  More \nthan  occasionally,  programs  are  done  \"on  location,\"  in  exotic \nlocales  with  attractive  and  unfamiliar  vistas. \nIn addition,  exceedingly  handsome  people  are  usually  in \nview,  both  on  the  stage  and  in  the  audience.  Robert  Schuller  is \nparticularly  partial  to  celebrities,  especially  movie  actors  like \nEfrem  Zimbalist,  Jr.,  and  Cliff  Robertson,  who  have  declared\n\f\nShuffle Off  to Bethlehem 121 \ntheir  allegiance  to  him.  Not  only  does  Schuller  have  celebrities \non his  show  but  his  advertisements  use  their  presence  to  attract \nan audience.  Indeed,  I  think  it  fair  to say that  attracting  an  audi-\nence is  the  main  goal  of  these  programs,  just  as  it is for  \"The  A-\nTeam\"  and  \"Dallas.\" \nTo achieve  this  goal,  the  most  modern  methods  of  marketing \nand promotion  are  abundantly  used,  such  as  offering  free  pam-\nphlets,  Bibles  and  gifts,  and,  in  Jerry  Falwell's  case,  two  free \n\"Jesus  First\"  pins.  The  preachers  are  forthright  about  how  they \ncontrol  the  content  of  their  preaching  to  maximize  their  ratings. \nYou shall  wait  a  very  long  time  indeed  if  you  wish  to  hear  an \nelectronic  preacher  refer  to the  difficulties  a rich  man  will  have \nin gaining  access  to  heaven.  The  executive  director  of  the  Na-\ntional  Religious  Broadcasters  Association  sums  up  what  he  calls \nthe unwritten  law  of all television  preachers:  \"You  can  get  your \nshare  of  the  audience  only  by  offering  people  something  they \nwant.\"3 \nYou will  note,  I  am  sure,  that  this  is  an  unusual  religious \ncredo.  There  is  no  great  religious  leader—from  the  Buddha  to \nMoses  to  Jesus  to  Mohammed  to  Luther—who  offered  people \nwhat  they  want.  Only  what  they  need.  But  television  is  not  well \nsuited  to  offering  people  what  they  need.  It  is \"user  friendly.\"  It \nis too easy  to  turn  off.  It is at its most  alluring  when  it  speaks  the \nlanguage  of  dynamic  visual  imagery.  It  does  not  accommodate \ncomplex  language  or  stringent  demands.  As  a  consequence, \nwhat  is  preached  on  television  is  not  anything  like  the  Sermon \non the  Mount.  Religious  programs  are  filled  with  good  cheer. \nThey celebrate  affluence.  Their  featured  players  become  celebri-\nties. Though  their  messages  are  trivial,  the  shows  have  high  rat-\nings, or rather,  because their  messages  are  trivial,  the  shows  have \nhigh ratings. \nI believe  I  am  not  mistaken  in  saying  that  Christianity  is  a \ndemanding  and  serious  religion.  When  it  is  delivered  as  easy \nand amusing,  it  is another  kind  of  religion  altogether. \nThere  are,  of course,  counterarguments  to  the  claim  that  tele-\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to  Death 122 \nvision  degrades  religion.  Among  them  is  that  spectacle  is hardly \na stranger  to  religion.  If  one  puts  aside  the  Quakers  and  a  few \nother  austere  sects,  every  religion  tries  to  make  itself  appealing \nthrough  art,  music,  icons  and  awe-inspiring  ritual.  The  aesthetic \ndimension  to  religion  is  the  source  of its attraction  to  many  peo-\nple. This  is  especially  true  of  Roman  Catholicism  and  Judaism, \nwhich  supply  their  congregants  with  haunting  chants;  mag-\nnificent  robes  and  shawls;  magical  hats,  wafers  and  wine; \nstained-glass  windows;  and  the  mysterious  cadences  of  ancient \nlanguages.  The  difference  between  these  accoutrements  of  re-\nligion  and  the  floral  displays,  fountains  and  elaborate  sets  we \nsee on  television  is  that  the  former  are  not,  in  fact,  accoutre-\nments  but  integral  parts  of  the  history  and  doctrines  of  the  re-\nligion  itself;  they  require  congregants  to  respond  to  them  with \nsuitable  reverence.  A  Jew  does  not  cover  his  head  at  prayer \nbecause  a  skull  cap  looks  good  on  television.  A  Catholic  does \nnot  light  a  votive  candle  to  improve  the  look  of  the  altar.  Rab-\nbis, priests  and  Presbyterian ministers  do  not,  in  the  midst  of  a \nservice,  take  testimony  from  movie  stars  to  find  out  why  they \nare religious  people.  The  spectacle  we  find  in  true  religions  has \nas its  purpose  enchantment,  not  entertainment.  The  distinction \nis critical.  By  endowing  things  with  magic,  enchantment  is  the \nmeans  through  which  we  may  gain  access  to  sacredness.  Enter-\ntainment  is  the  means  through  which  we  distance  ourselves \nfrom  it. \nThe reply  to  this  is  that  most  of  the  religion  available  to  us  on \ntelevision  is  \"fundamentalist,\"  which  explicitly  disdains  ritual \nand  theology  in  favor  of  direct  communication  with  the  Bible \nitself,  that  is,  with  God.  Without  ensnaring  myself  in  a theologi-\ncal argument  for  which  I  am unprepared,  I  think  it  both  fair  and \nobvious  to  say  that  on  television,  God  is  a  vague  and  subordi-\nnate  character.  Though  His  name  is  invoked  repeatedly,  the \nconcreteness  and  persistence  of  the  image  of  the  preacher  car-\nries the  clear  message  that  it  is  he,  not  He,  who  must  be  wor-\nshipped.  I  do  not  mean  to  imply  that  the  preacher  wishes  it  to\n\f\nShuffle Off  to Bethlehem 123 \nbe so;  only  that  the  power  of  a close-up  televised  face,  in  color, \nmakes  idolatry  a  continual  hazard.  Television  is,  after  all, a form \nof graven  imagery  far  more  alluring  than  a  golden  calf.  I suspect \n(though  I  have  no  external  evidence  of  it)  that  Catholic  objec-\ntions  to  Bishop  Fulton  Sheen's  theatrical  performances  on  tele-\nvision  (of  several  years  back)  sprang  from  the  impression  that \nviewers  were  misdirecting  their  devotions,  away  from  God  and \ntoward  Bishop  Sheen,  whose  piercing  eyes,  awesome  cape  and \nstately  tones  were  as  close  a  resemblance  to  a  deity  as  charisma \nallows. \nTelevision's  strongest  point  is  that  it  brings  personalities  into \nour  hearts,  not  abstractions  into  our  heads.  That  is  why  CBS' \nprograms  about  the  universe  were  called  \"Walter  Cronkite's \nUniverse.\"  One  would  think  that  the  grandeur  of  the  universe \nneeds  no  assistance  from  Walter  Cronkite.  One  would  think \nwrong.  CBS  knows  that  Walter  Cronkite  plays  better  on  televi-\nsion than  the  Milky  Way.  And  Jimmy  Swaggart  plays  better \nthan  God.  For  God  exists  only  in  our  minds,  whereas  Swaggart \nis there, to  be  seen,  admired,  adored.  Which  is  why  he  is  the  star \nof the  show.  And  why  Billy  Graham  is  a celebrity,  and  why  Oral \nRoberts  has  his  own  university,  and  why  Robert  Schuller  has  a \ncrystal  cathedral  all  to  himself.  If  I  am  not  mistaken,  the  word \nfor this  is  blasphemy. \nThere  is  a  final  argument  that  whatever  criticisms  may  be \nmade  of  televised  religion,  there  remains  the  inescapable  fact \nthat  it  attracts  viewers  by  the  millions.  This  would  appear  to  be \nthe meaning  of  the  statements,  quoted  earlier  by  Billy  Graham \nand Pat Robertson,  that  there  is  a need  for  it among  the  multi-\ntude.  To  which  the  best  reply  I  know  was  made  by  Hannah \nArendt,  who,  in  reflecting  on  the  products  of  mass  culture, \nwrote: \nThis state of affairs, which indeed is equalled nowhere else in the \nworld, can properly be called mass culture; its promoters are nei-\nther the masses nor their entertainers, but  are those who  try to\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to  Death 124 \nentertain the masses with what once  was  an authentic object of \nculture, or to persuade them that Hamlet can be as entertaining as \nMy Fair  Lady, and educational as well. The danger of mass educa-\ntion is  precisely that  it  may  become  very  entertaining indeed; \nthere are many great authors of the past who have survived cen-\nturies of  oblivion  and  neglect,  but  it  is  still an  open  question \nwhether they  will  be  able to  survive an  entertaining version of \nwhat they have to say.4 \nIf we  substitute  the  word  \"religion\"  for  Hamlet,  and  the \nphrase  \"great  religious  traditions\"  for  \"great  authors  of  the \npast,\"  this  quotation  may  stand  as  the  decisive  critique  of  tele-\nvised  religion.  There  is  no  doubt,  in  other  words,  that  religion \ncan be  made  entertaining.  The  question  is,  By  doing  so,  do  we \ndestroy  it  as  an  \"authentic  object  of  culture\"?  And  does  the \npopularity  of  a religion  that  employs  the  full  resources  of vaude-\nville drive  more  traditional  religious  conceptions  into  manic \nand  trivial  displays?  I  have  already  referred  to  Cardinal  O'Con-\nnor's  embarrassing  attempts  to  be  well  liked  and  amusing,  and \nto a parish  priest  who  cheerfully  tries  to add  rock  music  to  Cath-\nolic education.  I  know  of  one  rabbi  who  has  seriously  proposed \nto his  congregation  that  Luciano  Pavarotti  be  engaged  to  sing \nKol Nidre  at  a  Yom  Kippur  service.  He  believes  that  the  event \nwould  fill  the  synagogue  as  never  before.  Who  can  doubt  it? \nBut as  Hannah  Arendt  would  say,  that  is  the  problem,  not  a \nsolution  to  one.  As  a member  of  the  Commission  on  Theology, \nEducation  and  the  Electronic  Media  of  the  National  Council  of \nthe  Churches  of  Christ,  I  am  aware  of  the  deep  concern  among \n\"established\"  Protestant  religions  about  the  tendency  toward \nrefashioning  Protestant  services  so  that  they  are  more  televisi-\nble. It  is  well  understood  at  the  National  Council  that  the  dan-\nger is  not  that  religion  has  become  the  content  of  television \nshows  but  that  television  shows  may  become  the  content  of \nreligion.\n\f\nIn The  Last  Hurrah,  Edwin  O'Connor's  fine  novel  about  lusty \nparty  politics  in  Boston,  Mayor  Frank  Skeffington  tries  to  in-\nstruct  his  young  nephew  in  the  realities  of  political  machinery. \nPolitics, he tells  him,  is  the  greatest  spectator  sport  in  America. \nIn 1966,  Ronald  Reagan  used  a  different  metaphor.  \"Politics,\" \nhe said,  \"is  just  like  show  business.\"1 \nAlthough  sports  has  now  become  a  major  branch  of  show \nbusiness,  it  still  contains  elements  that  make  Skeffington's  vi-\nsion of  politics  somewhat  more  encouraging  than  Reagan's.  In \nany sport  the  standard  of  excellence  is  well  known  to  both  the \nplayers  and  spectators,  and  an  athlete's  reputation  rises  and  falls \nby his  or  her  proximity  to  that  standard.  Where  an  athlete \nstands  in  relation  to  it  cannot  be  easily  disguised  or  faked, \nwhich  means  that  David  Garth  can  do  very  little  to  improve  the \nimage  of an outfielder  with  a  .218  batting  average.  It  also  means \nthat  a  public  opinion  poll  on  the  question,  Who  is  the  best \nwoman  tennis  player  in  the  world?,  is  meaningless.  The  public's \nopinion  has  nothing  to  do  with  it.  Martina  Navratilova's  serve \nprovides  the  decisive  answer. \nOne  may  also  note  that  spectators  at  a sporting  event  are  usu-\nally well  aware  of  the  rules  of  the  game  and  the  meaning  of \neach  piece  of the  action.  There  is no way  for  a batter  who  strikes \nout with  the  bases  loaded  to  argue  the  spectators  into  believing \nthat  he  has  done  a useful  thing  for  his team  (except,  perhaps,  by \nreminding  them  that  he  could have  hit  into  a  double  play).  The \ndifference  between  hits  and  strike-outs,  touchdowns  and  fum-\n125 \nReach Out and Elect Someone \n9.\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to Death 126 \nbles,  aces  and  double  faults  cannot  be  blurred,  even  by  the \npomposities  and  malapropisms  of  a  Howard  Cosell.  If  politics \nwere  like  a  sporting  event,  there  would  be  several  virtues  to \nattach  to  its  name:  clarity,  honesty,  excellence. \nBut what  virtues  attach  to  politics  if Ronald  Reagan  is  right? \nShow  business  is  not  entirely  without  an  idea  of  excellence,  but \nits main  business  is  to please  the  crowd,  and  its  principal  instru-\nment  is  artifice.  If politics  is  like  show  business,  then  the  idea  is \nnot  to  pursue  excellence,  clarity  or  honesty  but  to  appear  as  if \nyou are,  which  is  another  matter  altogether.  And  what  the \nother  matter  is  can  be  expressed  in  one  word:  advertising.  In \nJoe  McGinnis'  book  about  Richard  Nixon's  campaign  in  1968, \nThe Selling of the President, he  said  much  of  what  needs  to  be said \nabout  politics  and  advertising,  both  in  his  title  and  in  the  book. \nBut not  quite  all.  For  though  the  selling  of  a  President is  an \nastonishing  and  degrading  thing,  it  is only  part  of a larger  point: \nIn America,  the  fundamental  metaphor  for  political  discourse  is \nthe  television  commercial. \nThe television  commercial  is  the  most  peculiar  and  pervasive \nform  of communication  to  issue  forth  from  the  electric  plug.  An \nAmerican  who  has  reached  the  age  of  forty  will  have  seen  well \nover  one  million  television  commercials  in  his  or  her  lifetime, \nand  has  close  to  another  million  to  go  before  the  first  Social \nSecurity  check  arrives.  We  may  safely  assume,  therefore,  that \nthe  television  commercial  has  profoundly  influenced  American \nhabits  of thought.  Certainly,  there  is no difficulty  in demonstrat-\ning that  it  has  become  an  important  paradigm  for  the  structure \nof every  type  of  public  discourse.  My  major  purpose  here  is  to \nshow  how  it  has  devastated  political  discourse.  But  there  may \nbe some  value  in  my  pointing,  first,  to  its  effect  on  commerce \nitself. \nBy bringing  together  in  compact  form  all  of  the  arts  of  show \nbusiness—music,  drama,  imagery,  humor,  celebrity—the  tele-\nvision  commercial  has  mounted  the  most  serious  assault  on \ncapitalist  ideology  since  the  publication  of  Das  Kapital. To  un-\n\f\nReach Out and Elect  Someone 127 \nderstand  why,  we  must  remind  ourselves  that  capitalism,  like \nscience  and  liberal  democracy,  was  an  outgrowth  of  the  En-\nlightenment.  Its  principal  theorists,  even  its  most  prosperous \npractitioners,  believed  capitalism  to  be  based  on  the  idea  that \nboth  buyer  and  seller  are  sufficiently  mature,  well  informed  and \nreasonable  to  engage  in  transactions  of  mutual  self-interest.  If \ngreed was  taken  to  be  the  fuel  of  the  capitalist  engine,  then \nsurely  rationality  was  the  driver.  The  theory  states,  in  part,  that \ncompetition  in  the  marketplace  requires  that  the  buyer  not  only \nknows  what  is  good  for  him  but  also  what  is  good.  If  the  seller \nproduces  nothing  of  value,  as  determined  by  a rational  market-\nplace,  then  he  loses  out.  It  is  the  assumption  of  rationality \namong  buyers  that  spurs  competitors  to  become  winners,  and \nwinners  to  keep  on  winning.  Where  it  is assumed  that  a buyer  is \nunable  to  make  rational  decisions,  laws  are  passed  to  invalidate \ntransactions,  as,  for  example,  those  which  prohibit  children \nfrom  making  contracts.  In  America,  there  even  exists  in  law  a \nrequirement  that  sellers  must  tell  the  truth  about  their  products, \nfor if  the  buyer  has  no  protection  from  false  claims,  rational \ndecision-making  is  seriously  impaired. \nOf course,  the  practice  of  capitalism  has  its  contradictions. \nCartels  and  monopolies,  for  example,  undermine  the  theory. \nBut television  commercials  make  hash  of it. To take  the  simplest \nexample:  To  be  rationally  considered,  any  claim—commercial \nor otherwise—must  be  made  in  language.  More  precisely,  it \nmust  take  the  form  of  a  proposition,  for  that  is  the  universe  of \ndiscourse  from  which  such  words  as  \"true\"  and  \"false\"  come.  If \nthat  universe  of  discourse  is  discarded,  then  the  application  of \nempirical  tests,  logical  analysis  or  any  of  the  other  instruments \nof reason  are  impotent. \nThe move  away  from  the  use  of  propositions  in  commercial \nadvertising  began  at  the  end  of  the  nineteenth  century.  But  it \nwas not  until  the  1950's  that  the  television  commercial  made \nlinguistic  discourse  obsolete  as  the  basis  for  product  decisions. \nBy substituting  images  for  claims,  the  pictorial  commercial\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to Death 128 \nmade  emotional  appeal,  not  tests  of truth,  the  basis  of consumer \ndecisions.  The  distance  between  rationality  and  advertising  is \nnow  so  wide  that  it  is  difficult  to  remember  that  there  once \nexisted  a  connection  between  them.  Today,  on  television  com-\nmercials,  propositions  are  as  scarce  as  unattractive  people.  The \ntruth  or  falsity  of an  advertiser's  claim  is  simply  not  an  issue.  A \nMcDonald's  commercial,  for  example,  is  not  a  series  of testable, \nlogically  ordered  assertions.  It  is  a drama—a  mythology,  if  you \nwill—of  handsome  people  selling,  buying  and  eating  hamburg-\ners, and  being  driven  to  near  ecstasy  by  their  good  fortune.  No \nclaims  are  made,  except  those  the  viewer  projects  onto  or  infers \nfrom  the  drama.  One  can  like  or dislike  a television  commercial, \nof course.  But  one  cannot  refute  it. \nIndeed,  we  may  go  this  far:  The  television  commercial  is  not \nat all  about  the  character  of  products  to  be consumed.  It  is about \nthe  character  of  the  consumers  of  products.  Images  of  movie \nstars  and  famous  athletes,  of  serene  lakes  and  macho  fishing \ntrips,  of elegant  dinners  and  romantic  interludes,  of  happy  fami-\nlies packing  their  station  wagons  for  a  picnic  in  the  country— \nthese  tell  nothing  about  the  products  being  sold.  But  they  tell \neverything  about  the  fears,  fancies  and  dreams  of  those  who \nmight  buy  them.  What  the  advertiser  needs  to  know  is  not  what \nis right  about  the  product  but  what  is  wrong  about  the  buyer. \nAnd so,  the  balance  of  business  expenditures  shifts  from  product \nresearch  to  market  research.  The  television  commercial  has  ori-\nented  business  away  from  making  products  of value  and  toward \nmaking  consumers  feel  valuable,  which  means  that  the  business \nof business  has  now  become  pseudo-therapy.  The  consumer  is  a \npatient  assured  by  psycho-dramas. \nAll of this  would  come  as  a great  surprise  to  Adam  Smith,  just \nas the  transformation  of  politics  would  be  equally  surprising  to \nthe  redoubtable  George  Orwell.  It  is true,  as  George  Steiner  has \nremarked,  that  Orwell  thought  of  Newspeak  as  originating,  in \npart,  from  \"the  verbiage  of  commercial  advertising.\"  But  when \nOrwell  wrote  in  his  famous  essay  \"The  Politics of  the  English\n\f\nReach Out  and  Elect  Someone 129 \nLanguage\"  that  politics  has  become  a  matter  of  \"defending  the \nindefensible,\"  he  was  assuming  that  politics  would  remain  a \ndistinct,  although  corrupted,  mode  of  discourse.  His  contempt \nwas aimed  at  those  politicians  who  would  use  sophisticated \nversions  of  the  age-old  arts  of  double-think,  propaganda  and \ndeceit.  That  the  defense  of the  indefensible  would  be  conducted \nas a  form  of  amusement  did  not  occur  to  him.  He  feared  the \npolitician  as  deceiver,  not  as  entertainer. \nThe television  commercial  has  been  the  chief  instrument  in \ncreating  the  modern  methods  of  presenting  political  ideas.  It  has \naccomplished  this  in  two  ways.  The  first  is  by requiring  its  form \nto be used  in  political  campaigns.  It  is not  necessary,  I  take  it,  to \nsay very  much  about  this  method.  Everyone  has  noticed  and \nworried  in  varying  degrees  about  it,  including  former  New  York \nCity mayor  John  Lindsay,  who  has  proposed  that  political \n\"commercials\"  be  prohibited.  Even  television  commentators \nhave  brought  it  to  our  attention,  as  for  example,  Bill  Moyers  in \n\"The  Thirty-second  President,\" a  documentary  on  his  excellent \ntelevision  series  \"A  Walk  Through  the  20th  Century.\"  My  own \nawakening  to  the  power  of  the  television  commercial  as  politi-\ncal discourse  came  as  a  result  of  a  personal  experience  of  a few \nyears  back,  when  I  played  a  minuscule  role  in  Ramsey  Clark's \nSenate  campaign  against  Jacob  Javits  in  New  York.  A  great  be-\nliever  in  the  traditional  modes  of  political  discourse,  Clark  pre-\npared  a  small  library  of  carefully  articulated  position  papers  on \na variety  of  subjects  from  race  relations  to  nuclear  power  to  the \nMiddle  East.  He  filled  each  paper  with  historical  background, \neconomic  and  political  facts,  and,  I  thought,  an  enlightened  so-\nciological  perspective.  He  might  as  well  have  drawn  cartoons. \nIn fact,  Jacob  Javits  did  draw  cartoons,  in  a manner  of  speaking. \nIf Javits  had  a  carefully  phrased  position  on  any  issue,  the  fact \nwas  largely  unknown.  He  built  his  campaign  on  a  series  of \nthirty-second  television  commercials  in  which  he  used  visual \nimagery,  in  much  the  same  way  as  a McDonald's  commercial,  to \nproject  himself  as  a man  of  experience,  virtue  and  piety.  For  all  I\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to Death 130 \nknow,  Javits  believed  as  strongly  in  reason  as  did Ramsey  Clark. \nBut he  believed  more  strongly  in  retaining  his  seat  in  the  Sen-\nate.  And  he  knew  full  well  in  what  century  we  are  living.  He \nunderstood  that  in  a world  of  television  and  other  visual  media, \n\"political  knowledge\"  means  having  pictures  in  your  head \nmore  than  having  words.  The  record  will  show  that  this  insight \ndid not  fail  him.  He  won  the  election  by  the  largest  plurality  in \nNew York  State  history.  And  I  will  not  labor  the  commonplace \nthat  any  serious  candidate  for  high  political  office  in  America \nrequires  the  services  of an  image  manager  to  design  the  kinds  of \npictures  that  will  lodge  in  the  public's  collective  head.  I  will \nwant  to  return  to  the  implications  of  \"image  politics\"  but  it  is \nnecessary,  before  that,  to  discuss  the  second  method  by  which \nthe television  commercial  shapes  political  discourse. \nBecause  the  television  commercial  is  the  single  most  volu-\nminous  form  of  public  communication  in  our  society,  it  was \ninevitable  that  Americans  would  accommodate  themselves  to \nthe  philosophy  of  television  commercials.  By  \"accommodate,\"  I \nmean  that  we  accept  them  as  a  normal  and  plausible  form  of \ndiscourse.  By  \"philosophy,\"  I  mean  that  the  television  commer-\ncial has  embedded  in  it  certain  assumptions  about  the  nature  of \ncommunication  that  run  counter  to  those  of  other  media,  espe-\ncially the  printed  word.  For  one  thing,  the  commercial  insists  on \nan unprecedented  brevity  of  expression.  One  may  even  say,  in-\nstancy.  A  sixty-second  commercial  is  prolix;  thirty  seconds  is \nlonger  than  most;  fifteen  to  twenty  seconds  is  about  average. \nThis is  a brash  and  startling  structure  for  communication  since, \nas I  remarked  earlier,  the  commercial  always  addresses  itself  to \nthe  psychological  needs  of  the  viewer.  Thus  it  is  not  merely \ntherapy.  It  is  instant  therapy.  Indeed,  it  puts  forward  a  psycho-\nlogical  theory  of  unique  axioms:  The  commercial  asks  us  to  be-\nlieve that  all  problems  are  solvable,  that  they  are  solvable  fast, \nand that  they  are  solvable  fast  through  the  interventions  of \ntechnology,  techniques  and  chemistry.  This  is,  of course,  a  pre-\nposterous  theory  about  the  roots  of  discontent,  and  would  ap-"

It \nis a  very  bad  commercial  indeed  that  engages  the  viewer  in \nwondering  about  the  validity  of  the  point  being  made.  That  is \nwhy  most  commercials  use  the  literary  device  of  the  pseudo-\nparable  as  a means  of  doing  their  work.  Such  \"parables\"  as  The \nRing Around  the  Collar,  The  Lost  Traveler's  Checks  and  The \nPhone Call  from  the  Son  Far  Away  not  only  have  irrefutable \nemotional  power  but,  like  Biblical  parables,  are  unambiguously \ndidactic.  The  television  commercial  is  about  products  only  in \nthe sense  that  the  story  of  Jonah  is  about  the  anatomy  of \nwhales,  which  is  to  say,  it  isn't.  Which  is  to  say  further,  it  is \nabout  how  one  ought  to  live  one's  life.  Moreover,  commercials \nhave  the  advantage  of  vivid  visual  symbols  through  which  we \nmay easily  learn  the  lessons  being  taught.  Among  those  lessons \nare that  short  and  simple  messages  are  preferable  to  long  and \ncomplex  ones;  that  drama  is  to  be  preferred  over  exposition; \nthat  being  sold  solutions  is  better  than  being  confronted  with \nquestions  about  problems.  Such  beliefs  would  naturally  have \nimplications  for  our  orientation  to  political  discourse;  that  is  to \nsay, we  may  begin  to  accept  as  normal  certain  assumptions \nabout  the  political  domain  that  either  derive  from  or  are  ampli-\nfied by  the  television  commercial.  For  example,  a  person  who \nhas seen  one  million  television  commercials  might  well  believe \nthat  all  political  problems  have  fast  solutions  through  simple \nmeasures—or  ought  to.  Or  that  complex  language  is  not  to  be \ntrusted,  and  that  all  problems  lend  themselves  to  theatrical  ex-\npression.  Or  that  argument  is  in bad  taste,  and  leads  only  to  an \nintolerable  uncertainty.  Such  a person  may  also  come  to  believe \nthat  it  is  not  necessary  to  draw  any  line  between  politics  and \nother  forms  of  social  life.  Just  as  a  television  commercial  will \nuse an  athlete,  an  actor,  a  musician,  a  novelist,  a  scientist  or  a \ncountess  to  speak  for  the  virtues  of  a  product  in  no  way  within \ntheir  domain  of  expertise,  television  also  frees  politicians  from \nthe limited  field  of  their  own  expertise.  Political  figures  may\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to  Death 132 \nshow  up  anywhere,  at  any  time,  doing  anything,  without  being \nthought  odd,  presumptuous,  or  in  any  way  out  of  place.  Which \nis to  say,  they  have  become  assimilated  into  the  general  televi-\nsion  culture  as  celebrities. \nBeing  a  celebrity  is  quite  different  from  being  well  known. \nHarry  Truman  was  well  known  but  he  was  not  a  celebrity. \nWhenever  the  public  saw  him  or  heard  him,  Truman  was  talk-\ning politics.  It  takes  a  very  rich  imagination  to  envision  Harry \nTruman  or,  for  that  matter,  his  wife,  making  a  guest  appearance \non \"The  Goldbergs\"  or  \"I  Remember  Mama.\"  Politics and  pol-\niticians  had  nothing  to  do  with  these  shows,  which  people \nwatched  for  amusement,  not  to  familiarize  themselves  with  po-\nlitical  candidates  and  issues. \nIt is  difficult  to  say  exactly  when  politicians  began  to  put \nthemselves  forward,  intentionally,  as  sources  of  amusement.  In \nthe  1950's,  Senator  Everett  Dirksen  appeared  as  a  guest  on \n\"What's  My  Line?\"  When  he  was  running  for  office,  John  F. \nKennedy  allowed  the  television  cameras  of  Ed  Murrow's  \"Per-\nson to  Person\"  to  invade  his  home.  When  he  was  not  run-\nning  for  office,  Richard  Nixon  appeared  for  a  few  seconds  on \n\"Laugh-In,\"  an  hour-long  comedy  show  based  on  the  format  of \na television  commercial.  By  the  1970's,  the  public  had  started  to \nbecome  accustomed  to  the  notion  that  political  figures  were  to \nbe taken  as  part  of  the  world  of  show  business.  In  the  1980's \ncame  the  deluge.  Vice-presidential  candidate  William  Miller  did \na commercial  for  American  Express.  So  did  the  star  of  the  Wa-\ntergate  Hearings,  Senator  Sam  Ervin.  Former  President  Gerald \nFord  joined  with  former  Secretary  of  State  Henry  Kissinger  for \nbrief  roles  on  \"Dynasty.\"  Massachusetts  Governor  Mike  Du-\nkakis  appeared  on  \"St.  Elsewhere.\"  Speaker  of  the  House  Tip \nO'Neill  did  a  stint  on  \"Cheers.\"  Consumer  advocate  Ralph \nNader,  George  McGovern  and  Mayor  Edward  Koch  hosted \n\"Saturday  Night  Live.\"  Koch  also  played  the  role  of  a  fight \nmanager  in  a made-for-television  movie  starring  James  Cagney. \nMrs.  Nancy  Reagan  appeared  on  \"Diff'rent  Strokes.\"  Would\n\f\nReach Out and Elect  Someone 133 \nanyone  be  surprised  if  Gary  Hart  turned  up  on  \"Hill  Street \nBlues\"?  Or  if Geraldine  Ferraro  played  a  small  role  as  a Queens \nhousewife  in  a  Francis  Coppola  film? \nAlthough  it  may  go  too  far  to  say  that  the  politician-as-\ncelebrity  has,  by  itself,  made  political  parties  irrelevant,  there  is \ncertainly  a  conspicuous  correlation  between  the  rise  of the  for-\nmer and  the  decline  of  the  latter.  Some  readers  may  remember \nwhen  voters  barely  knew  who  the  candidate  was  and,  in  any \ncase, were  not  preoccupied  with  his  character  and  personal  life. \nAs a young  man,  I  balked  one  November  at  voting  for  a Demo-\ncratic  mayoralty  candidate  who,  it  seemed  to  me,  was  both  un-\nintelligent  and  corrupt.  \"What  has  that  to  do  with  it?\"  my \nfather  protested.  \"All  Democratic  candidates  are  unintelligent \nand corrupt.  Do  you  want  the  Republicans  to  win?\"  He  meant \nto say  that  intelligent  voters  favored  the  party  that  best  repre-\nsented  their  economic  interests  and  sociological  perspective.  To \nvote for  the  \"best  man\"  seemed  to  him  an  astounding  and  naive \nirrelevance.  He  never  doubted  that  there  were  good  men  among \nRepublicans.  He  merely  understood  that  they  did  not  speak  for \nhis class.  He  shared,  with  an  unfailing  eye,  the  perspective  of \nBig Tim  Sullivan,  a  leader  of  New  York's  Tammany  Hall  in  its \nglory days.  As  Terence  Moran  recounts  in  his  essay,  \"Politics \n1984,\"  Sullivan  was  once  displeased  when  brought  the  news \nthat  the  vote  in his  precinct  was  6,382  for  the  Democrat  and  two \nfor the  Republican.  In  evaluating  this  disappointing  result,  Sul-\nlivan  remarked,  \"Sure,  didn't  Kelly  come  to  me  to  say  his  wife's \ncousin  was  running  on  the  Republican  line  and  didn't  I,  in  the \ninterests  of  domestic  tranquility,  give  him  leave  to  vote  Re-\npublican?  But  what  I  want  to  know  is,  who  else  voted  Re-\npublican?\"2 \nI will  not  argue  here  the  wisdom  of  this  point  of  view.  There \nmay be  a case  for  choosing  the  best  man  over  party  (although  I \nknow  of  none).  The  point  is  that  television  does  not  reveal  who \nthe best  man  is.  In  fact,  television  makes  impossible  the  deter-\nmination  of  who  is  better  than  whom,  if  we  mean  by  \"better\"\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to Death 134 \nsuch  things  as more  capable  in negotiation,  more  imaginative  in \nexecutive  skill,  more  knowledgeable  about  international  affairs, \nmore  understanding  of  the  interrelations  of  economic  systems, \nand  so  on.  The  reason  has,  almost  entirely,  to  do  with  \"image.\" \nBut not  because  politicians  are  preoccupied  with  presenting \nthemselves  in  the  best  possible  light.  After  all, who  isn't?  It  is a \nrare  and  deeply  disturbed  person  who  does  not  wish  to  project  a \nfavorable  image.  But  television  gives  image  a bad  name.  For  on \ntelevision  the  politician  does  not  so  much  offer  the  audience  an \nimage  of  himself,  as  offer  himself  as  an  image  of  the  audience. \nAnd therein  lies  one  of the  most  powerful  influences  of the  tele-\nvision  commercial  on  political  discourse. \nTo understand  how  image  politics  works  on  television,  we \nmay use  as  an  entry  point  the  well-known  commercial  from \nwhich  this  chapter  takes  the  first  half  of  its  title.  I  refer  to  the \nBell Telephone  romances,  created  by  Mr.  Steve  Horn,  in  which \nwe are  urged  to  \"Reach  Out  and  Touch  Someone.\"  The  \"some-\none\"  is  usually  a  relative  who  lives  in Denver  or  Los  Angeles  or \nAtlanta—in  any  case,  very  far  from  where  we  are,  and  who,  in \na good  year,  we  will  be  lucky  to  see  on  Thanksgiving  Day.  The \n\"someone\"  used  to  play  a daily  and  vital  role  in our  lives;  that  is \nto say,  used  to  be  a  member  of  the  family.  Though  American \nculture  stands  vigorously  opposed  to  the  idea  of  family,  there \nnonetheless  still  exists  a residual  nag  that  something  essential  to \nour  lives  is  lost  when  we  give  it up.  Enter  Mr.  Horn's  commer-\ncials. These  are  thirty-second  homilies  concerned  to  provide  a \nnew  definition  of  intimacy  in  which  the  telephone  wire  will \ntake  the  place  of old-fashioned  co-presence.  Even  further,  these \ncommercials  intimate  a new  conception  of family  cohesion  for  a \nnation  of  kinsmen  who  have  been  split  asunder  by automobiles, \njet aircraft  and  other  instruments  of  family  suicide.  In  analyzing \nthese  commercials,  Jay  Rosen  makes  the  following  observation: \n\"Horn  isn't  interested  in  saying  anything,  he  has  no  message  to \nget across.  His  goal  is  not  to  provide  information  about  Bell,  but \nto somehow  bring  out  from  the  broken  ties  of millions  of Amer-\n\f\nReach Out and Elect  Someone 135 \nican lives  a  feeling  which  might  focus  on  the  telephone.  .  .  . \nHorn does  not  express  himself.  You  do  not  express  yourself. \nHorn  expresses  you.\"3 \nThis is  the  lesson  of  all  great  television  commercials:  They \nprovide  a  slogan,  a  symbol  or  a  focus  that  creates  for  viewers  a \ncomprehensive  and  compelling  image  of  themselves.  In  the \nshift  from  party  politics  to  television  politics,  the  same  goal  is \nsought.  We  are  not  permitted  to  know  who  is  best  at being  Pres-\nident  or  Governor  or  Senator,  but  whose  image  is best in  touch-\ning and  soothing  the  deep  reaches  of our  discontent.  We  look  at \nthe television  screen  and  ask,  in  the  same  voracious  way  as  the \nQueen  in  Snow  White  and  the  Seven  Dwarfs, \"Mirror,  mirror  on \nthe wall,  who  is  the  fairest  one  of  all?\"  We  are  inclined  to  vote \nfor those  whose  personality,  family  life,  and  style,  as  imaged  on \nthe screen,  give  back  a  better  answer  than  the  Queen  received. \nAs Xenophanes  remarked  twenty-five  centuries  ago,  men  al-\nways  make  their  gods  in  their  own  image.  But  to  this,  television \npolitics  has  added  a  new  wrinkle:  Those  who  would  be  gods \nrefashion  themselves  into  images  the  viewers  would  have \nthem  be. \nAnd so,  while  image  politics  preserves  the  idea  of self-interest \nvoting,  it  alters  the  meaning  of  \"self-interest.\"  Big Tim Sullivan \nand my  father  voted  for  the  party  that  represented  their  inter-\nests, but  \"interests\"  meant  to  them  something  tangible—pa-\ntronage,  preferential  treatment,  protection  from  bureaucracy, \nsupport  for  one's  union  or  community,  Thanksgiving  turkeys \nfor indigent  families.  Judged  by  this  standard,  blacks  may  be  the \nonly sane  voters  left  in America.  Most  of  the  rest  of  us  vote  our \ninterests,  but  they  are  largely  symbolic  ones,  which  is  to say,  of \na psychological  nature.  Like  television  commercials,  image  pol-\nitics is a form  of therapy,  which  is  why  so  much  of  it  is charm, \ngood looks,  celebrity  and  personal  disclosure.  It  is  a  sobering \nthought  to  recall  that  there  are  no  photographs  of  Abraham \nLincoln smiling,  that  his  wife  was  in  all  likelihood  a  psycho-\npath,  and  that  he  was  subject  to  lengthy  fits  of  depression.

We  do \nnot want  our  mirrors  to  be  so  dark  and  so  far  from  amusing. \nWhat  I  am saying  is  that  just  as  the  television  commercial  emp-\nties itself  of  authentic  product  information  so  that  it  can  do  its \npsychological  work,  image  politics  empties  itself  of  authentic \npolitical  substance  for  the  same  reason. \nIt follows  from  this  that  history  can  play  no  significant  role  in \nimage  politics.  For  history  is  of  value  only  to  someone  who \ntakes  seriously  the  notion  that  there  are  patterns  in  the  past \nwhich  may  provide  the  present  with  nourishing  traditions. \n\"The  past  is  a world,\"  Thomas  Carlyle  said,  \"and  not  a  void  of \ngrey haze.\"  But  he  wrote  this  at  a  time  when  the  book  was  the \nprincipal  medium  of  serious  public  discourse.  A  book  is  all his-\ntory.  Everything  about  it  takes  one  back  in  time—from  the  way \nit is produced  to  its linear  mode  of  exposition  to  the  fact  that  the \npast tense  is  its  most  comfortable  form  of  address.  As  no  other \nmedium  before  or  since,  the  book  promotes  a  sense  of  a  co-\nherent  and  usable  past.  In  a  conversation  of  books,  history,  as \nCarlyle  understood  it,  is not  only  a world  but  a  living  world.  It is \nthe  present  that  is  shadowy. \nBut television  is  a speed-of-light  medium,  a  present-centered \nmedium.  Its  grammar,  so  to  say,  permits  no  access  to  the  past. \nEverything  presented  in  moving  pictures  is  experienced  as  hap-\npening  \"now,\"  which  is  why  we  must  be  told  in  language that  a \nvideotape  we  are  seeing  was  made  months  before.  Moreover, \nlike its  forefather,  the  telegraph,  television  needs  to  move  frag-\nments  of  information,  not  to  collect  and  organize  them.  Carlyle \nwas more  prophetic  than  he  could  imagine:  The  literal  gray \nhaze  that  is  the  background  void  on  all  television  screens  is  an \napt metaphor  of  the  notion  of  history  the  medium  puts  forward. \nIn the  Age  of  Show  Business  and  image  politics,  political  dis-\ncourse  is  emptied  not  only  of  ideological  content  but  of  histor-\nical content,  as  well. \nCzeslaw  Milosz,  winner  of  the  1980  Nobel  Prize for  Liter-\nature,  remarked  in  his  acceptance  speech  in  Stockholm  that  our\n\f\nReach Out and Elect  Someone 137 \nage is  characterized  by  a  \"refusal  to  remember\";  he  cited, \namong  other  things,  the  shattering  fact  that  there  are  now  more \nthan  one  hundred  books  in  print  that  deny  that  the  Holocaust \never took  place.  The  historian  Carl  Schorske  has,  in my  opinion, \ncircled closer  to  the  truth  by  noting  that  the  modern  mind  has \ngrown  indifferent  to history  because  history  has  become  useless \nto it; in  other  words,  it  is not  obstinacy  or  ignorance  but  a  sense \nof irrelevance  that  leads  to  the  diminution  of  history.  Televi-\nsion's  Bill Moyers  inches  still closer  when  he  says,  \"I  worry  that \nmy own  business  .  .  .  helps  to  make  this  an  anxious  age  of \nagitated  amnesiacs.  .  .  .  We  Americans  seem  to  know  every-\nthing  about  the  last  twenty-four  hours  but  very  little  of the  last \nsixty centuries  or  the  last  sixty  years.\"4  Terence  Moran,  I  be-\nlieve, lands  on  the  target  in  saying  that  with  media  whose  struc-\nture  is  biased  toward  furnishing  images  and  fragments,  we  are \ndeprived  of  access  to  an  historical  perspective.  In  the  absence  of \ncontinuity  and  context,  he  says,  \"bits  of  information  cannot  be \nintegrated  into  an  intelligent  and  consistent  whole.\"5  We  do \nnot refuse  to remember;  neither  do  we  find  it  exactly  useless  to \nremember.  Rather,  we  are  being  rendered  unfit  to  remember. \nFor if  remembering  is  to  be  something  more  than  nostalgia,  it \nrequires  a  contextual  basis—a  theory,  a  vision,  a  metaphor— \nsomething within  which  facts  can be  organized  and  patterns  dis-\ncerned.  The  politics  of  image  and  instantaneous  news  provides \nno such  context,  is,  in  fact,  hampered  by  attempts  to  provide \nany.  A  mirror  records  only  what  you  are  wearing  today.  It  is \nsilent about  yesterday.  With  television,  we  vault  ourselves  into \na continuous,  incoherent  present.  \"History,\"  Henry  Ford  said, \n\"is bunk.\"  Henry  Ford  was  a  typographic  optimist.  \"History,\" \nthe Electric  Plug replies,  \"doesn't  exist.\" \nIf these  conjectures  make  sense,  then  in  this  Orwell  was \nwrong  once  again,  at  least  for  the  Western  democracies.  He  en-\nvisioned  the  demolition  of  history,  but  believed  that  it  would  be \naccomplished  by  the  state;  that  some  equivalent  of  the  Ministry \nof Truth  would  systematically  banish  inconvenient  facts  and de-\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to  Death 138 \nstroy  the  records  of  the  past.  Certainly,  this  is  the  way  of  the \nSoviet  Union,  our  modern-day  Oceania.  But  as  Huxley  more \naccurately  foretold  it,  nothing  so  crude  as  all  that  is  required. \nSeemingly  benign  technologies  devoted  to  providing  the  popu-\nlace  with  a  politics  of  image,  instancy  and  therapy  may  disap-\npear  history  just  as  effectively,  perhaps  more  permanently,  and \nwithout  objection. \nWe ought  also  to  look  to  Huxley,  not  Orwell,  to  understand \nthe  threat  that  television  and  other  forms  of imagery  pose  to  the \nfoundation  of  liberal  democracy—namely,  to  freedom  of  in-\nformation.  Orwell  quite  reasonably  supposed  that  the  state, \nthrough  naked  suppression,  would  control  the  flow  of informa-\ntion,  particularly  by  the  banning  of  books.  In  this  prophecy, \nOrwell  had  history  strongly  on  his  side.  For  books  have  always \nbeen  subjected  to  censorship  in  varying  degrees  wherever  they \nhave  been  an  important  part  of  the  communication  landscape. \nIn ancient  China,  the  Analects  of  Confucius  were  ordered  de-\nstroyed  by  Emperor  Chi  Huang  Ti.  Ovid's  banishment  from \nRome  by  Augustus  was  in  part  a  result  of  his  having  written  Ars \nAmatoria. Even  in  Athens,  which  set  enduring  standards  of \nintellectual  excellence,  books  were  viewed  with  alarm.  In \nAreopagitica, Milton  provides  an  excellent  review  of  the  many \nexamples  of  book  censorship  in  Classical  Greece,  including  the \ncase  of Protagoras, whose  books  were  burned  because  he  began \none  of  his  discourses  with  the  confession  that  he  did  not  know \nwhether  or  not  there  were  gods.  But  Miîton  is  careful  to observe \nthat  in  all  the  cases  before  his  own  time,  there  were  only  two \ntypes  of  books  that,  as  he  puts  it,  \"the  magistrate  cared  to  take \nnotice  of:  books  that  were  blasphemous  and  books  that  were \nlibelous.  Milton  stresses  this  point  because,  writing  almost  two \nhundred  years  after  Gutenberg,  he  knew  that  the  magistrates  of \nhis own  era,  if  unopposed,  would  disallow  books  of  every  con-\nceivable  subject  matter.  Milton  knew,  in  other  words,  that  it \nwas  in  the  printing  press  that  censorship  had  found  its  true \nmétier;  that,  in  fact,  information  and  ideas  did  not  become  a\n\f\nReach Out and Elect  Someone 139 \nprofound  cultural  problem  until  the  maturing  of  the  Age  of \nPrint. Whatever  dangers  there  may  be  in  a  word  that  is  written, \nsuch  a  word  is  a hundred  times  more  dangerous  when  stamped \nby a  press.  And  the  problem  posed  by  typography  was  recog-\nnized  early;  for  example,  by  Henry  VIII,  whose  Star  Chamber \nwas authorized  to  deal  with  wayward  books.  It  continued  to  be \nrecognized  by  Elizabeth  I,  the  Stuarts,  and  many  other  post-\nGutenberg  monarchs,  including  Pope Paul IV, in  whose  reign \nthe first  Index  Librorum  Prohibitorum  was  drawn.  To  paraphrase \nDavid Riesman  only  slightly,  in  a world  of  printing,  information \nis the  gunpowder  of  the  mind;  hence  come  the  censors  in  their \naustere  robes  to  dampen  the  explosion. \nThus,  Orwell  envisioned  that  (1)  government  control  over  (2) \nprinted  matter  posed  a  serious  threat  for  Western  democracies. \nHe was  wrong  on  both  counts.  (He  was,  of course,  right  on  both \ncounts  insofar  as  Russia,  China  and  other  pre-electronic  cul-\ntures  are  concerned.)  Orwell  was,  in  effect,  addressing  himself \nto a  problem  of  the  Age  of  Print—in fact,  to  the  same  problem \naddressed  by  the  men  who  wrote  the  United  States  Constitu-\ntion.  The  Constitution  was  composed  at  a  time  when  most  free \nmen  had  access  to  their  communities  through  a  leaflet,  a news-\npaper  or  the  spoken  word.  They  were  quite  well  positioned  to \nshare  their  political  ideas  with  each  other  in  forms  and  contexts \nover  which  they  had  competent  control.  Therefore,  their  great-\nest worry  was  the  possibility  of  government  tyranny.  The  Bill  of \nRights  is  largely  a  prescription  for  preventing  government  from \nrestricting  the  flow  of information  and  ideas.  But  the  Founding \nFathers  did  not  foresee  that  tyranny  by  government  might  be \nsuperseded  by  another  sort  of  problem  altogether,  namely,  the \ncorporate  state,  which  through  television  now  controls  the  flow \nof public  discourse  in  America.  I  raise  no  strong  objection  to  this \nfact (at  least  not  here)  and  have  no  intention  of  launching  into  a \nstandard-brand  complaint  against  the  corporate  state.  I  merely \nnote  the  fact  with  apprehension,  as  did George  Gerbner,  Dean  of \nthe Annenberg  School  of  Communication,  when  he  wrote:\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to  Death 140 \nTelevision is  the new  state religion run by a  private Ministry of \nCulture (the  three networks), offering a universal curriculum for \nall people, financed by a form of hidden taxation without repre-\nsentation. You  pay when  you  wash,  not  when  you  watch, and \nwhether or not you care to watch. . . .6 \nEarlier  in  the  same  essay,  Gerbner  said: \nLiberation cannot  be  accomplished by  turning [television]  off. \nTelevision is  for most people the most attractive thing going any \ntime of  the  day or  night. We  live in  a  world in  which  the  vast \nmajority will  not  turn off. If we don't get the message from the \ntube, we get it through other people. \nI do not  think  Professor Gerbner  meant  to  imply  in  these  sen-\ntences  that  there  is  a conspiracy  to  take  charge  of  our  symbolic \nworld  by  the  men  who  run  the  \"Ministry  of  Culture.\"  I  even \nsuspect  he  would  agree  with  me  that  if  the  faculty  of  the  An-\nnenberg  School  of  Communication  were  to  take  over  the  three \nnetworks,  viewers  would  hardly  notice  the  difference.  I believe \nhe means  to  say—and  in  any  case,  I  do—that  in  the  Age  of \nTelevision,  our  information  environment  is  completely  different \nfrom  what  it  was  in  1783;  that  we  have  less  to fear  from  govern-\nment  restraints  than  from  television  glut;  that,  in  fact,  we  have \nno way  of  protecting  ourselves  from  information  disseminated \nby corporate  America;  and  that,  therefore,  the  battles  for  liberty \nmust  be  fought  on  different  terrains  from  where  they  once \nwere. \nFor example,  I  would  venture  the  opinion  that  the  traditional \ncivil libertarian  opposition  to  the  banning  of  books  from  school \nlibraries  and  from  school  curricula  is  now  largely  irrelevant. \nSuch  acts  of  censorship  are  annoying,  of  course,  and  must  be \nopposed.  But  they  are  trivial.  Even  worse,  they  are  distracting, \nin that  they  divert  civil  libertarians  from  confronting  those \nquestions  that  have  to  do  with  the  claims  of  new  technologies.\n\f\nReach Out and Elect  Someone 141 \nTo put  it  plainly,  a  student's  freedom  to  read  is  not  seriously \ninjured  by someone's  banning  a  book  on  Long  Island  or  in Ana-\nheim  or  anyplace  else.  But  as  Gerbner  suggests,  television \nclearly  does  impair  the  student's  freedom  to read,  and  it  does  so \nwith  innocent  hands,  so  to  speak.  Television  does  not  ban \nbooks,  it  simply  displaces  them. \nThe fight  against  censorship  is  a  nineteenth-century  issue \nwhich  was  largely  won  in  the  twentieth.  What  we  are  con-\nfronted  with  now  is  the  problem  posed  by  the  economic  and \nsymbolic  structure  of  television.  Those  who  run  television  do \nnot limit  our  access  to  information  but  in  fact  widen  it.  Our \nMinistry  of  Culture  is  Huxleyan,  not  Orwellian.  It  does  every-\nthing  possible  to  encourage  us  to  watch  continuously.  But  what \nwe watch  is  a  medium  which  presents  information  in  a  form \nthat  renders  it  simplistic,  nonsubstantive,  nonhistorical  and \nnoncontextual;  that  is  to  say,  information  packaged  as  enter-\ntainment.  In  America,  we  are  never  denied  the  opportunity  to \namuse  ourselves. \nTyrants  of all varieties  have  always  known  about  the  value  of \nproviding  the  masses  with  amusements  as  a means  of  pacifying \ndiscontent.  But  most  of  them  could  not  have  even  hoped  for  a \nsituation  in  which  the  masses  would  ignore  that  which  does  not \namuse.  That  is  why  tyrants  have  always  relied,  and  still  do,  on \ncensorship.  Censorship,  after  all, is the  tribute  tyrants  pay  to  the \nassumption  that  a  public  knows  the  difference  between  serious \ndiscourse  and  entertainment—and  cares.  How  delighted  would \nbe all the  kings,  czars  and  führers  of the  past  (and  commissars  of \nthe present)  to  know  that  censorship  is  not  a  necessity  when  all \npolitical  discourse  takes  the  form  of a jest.\n\f\nThere  could  not  have  been  a  safer  bet  when  it  began  in  1969 \nthan  that  \"Sesame  Street\"  would  be  embraced  by  children,  par-\nents  and  educators.  Children  loved  it  because  they  were  raised \non television  commercials,  which  they  intuitively  knew  were \nthe  most  carefully  crafted  entertainments  on  television.  To \nthose  who  had  not  yet  been  to  school,  even  to  those  who  had \njust  started,  the  idea  of  being  taught  by  a  series  of  commercials \ndid not  seem  peculiar.  And  that  television  should  entertain \nthem  was  taken  as  a  matter  of  course. \nParents embraced  \"Sesame  Street\"  for  several  reasons, \namong  them  that  it  assuaged  their  guilt  over  the  fact  that  they \ncould  not  or  would  not  restrict  their  children's  access  to  televi-\nsion.  \"Sesame  Street\"  appeared  to  justify  allowing  a  four-  or \nfive-year-old to  sit  transfixed  in  front  of  a  television  screen  for \nunnatural  periods  of  time.  Parents were  eager  to  hope  that  tele-\nvision  could  teach  their  children  something  other  than  which \nbreakfast  cereal  has  the  most  crackle.  At  the  same  time,  \"Ses-\name  Street\"  relieved  them  of  the  responsibility  of  teaching  their \npre-school  children  how  to  read—no  small  matter  in  a  culture \nwhere  children  are  apt  to  be  considered  a  nuisance.  They  could \nalso  plainly  see  that  in  spite  of  its  faults,  \"Sesame  Street\"  was \nentirely  consonant  with  the  prevailing  spirit  of  America.  Its  use \nof cute  puppets,  celebrities,  catchy  tunes,  and  rapid-fire  editing \nwas  certain  to  give  pleasure  to  the  children  and  would  therefore \nserve  as  adequate  preparation  for  their  entry  into  a  fun-loving \nculture. \n142 \nTeaching as  an Amusing Activity \n1O.\n\f\nTeaching as an Amusing  Activity 143 \nAs for  educators,  they  generally  approved  of  \"Sesame \nStreet,\"  too.  Contrary  to  common  opinion,  they  are  apt  to  find \nnew  methods  congenial,  especially  if  they  are  told  that  educa-\ntion can  be  accomplished  more  efficiently  by means  of  the  new \ntechniques.  (That  is  why  such  ideas  as  \"teacher-proof\"  text-\nbooks,  standardized  tests,  and,  now,  micro-computers  have \nbeen  welcomed  into  the  classroom.)  \"Sesame  Street\"  appeared \nto be  an  imaginative  aid  in  solving  the  growing  problem  of \nteaching  Americans  how  to  read,  while,  at  the  same  time,  en-\ncouraging  children  to  love  school. \nWe now  know  that  \"Sesame  Street\"  encourages  children  to \nlove school  only  if  school  is  like  \"Sesame  Street.\"  Which  is  to \nsay, we  now  know  that  \"Sesame  Street\"  undermines  what  the \ntraditional  idea  of  schooling  represents.  Whereas  a  classroom  is \na place  of social  interaction,  the  space  in  front  of a television  set \nis a  private  preserve.  Whereas  in  a  classroom,  one  may  ask  a \nteacher  questions,  one  can  ask  nothing  of  a  television  screen. \nWhereas  school  is  centered  on  the  development  of  language, \ntelevision  demands  attention  to  images.  Whereas  attending \nschool  is  a  legal  requirement,  watching  television  is  an  act  of \nchoice.  Whereas  in  school,  one  fails  to  attend  to  the  teacher  at \nthe risk  of punishment,  no  penalties  exist  for  failing  to attend  to \nthe television  screen.  Whereas  to  behave  oneself  in  school \nmeans  to  observe  rules  of  public  decorum,  television  watching \nrequires  no  such  observances,  has  no  concept  of  public  de-\ncorum.  Whereas  in  a classroom,  fun  is never  more  than  a  means \nto an  end,  on  television  it  is the  end  in  itself. \nYet \"Sesame  Street\"  and  its  progeny,  \"The  Electric  Com-\npany,\"  are  not  to  be  blamed  for  laughing  the  traditional  class-\nroom  out  of  existence.  If  the  classroom  now  begins  to  seem  a \nstale and  flat  environment  for  learning,  the  inventors  of  televi-\nsion itself  are  to  blame,  not  the  Children's  Television  Work-\nshop.  We  can  hardly  expect  those  who  want  to  make  good \ntelevision  shows  to  concern  themselves  with  what  the  class-\nroom  is  for.  They  are  concerned  with  what  television  is  for.  This\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to Death 144 \ndoes  not  mean  that  \"Sesame  Street\"  is  not  educational.  It  is,  in \nfact,  nothing  but  educational—in  the  sense  that  every  television \nshow  is  educational.  Just  as  reading  a  book—any  kind  of  book \n—promotes  a  particular  orientation  toward  learning,  watching \na television  show  does  the  same.  \"The  Little  House  on  the \nPrairie,\" \"Cheers\"  and  \"The  Tonight  Show\"  are  as  effective  as \n\"Sesame  Street\"  in  promoting  what  might  be  called  the  televi-\nsion  style  of learning.  And  this  style  of learning  is,  by its  nature, \nhostile  to  what  has  been  called  book-learning  or  its  hand-\nmaiden,  school-learning.  If  we are  to  blame  \"Sesame  Street\"  for \nanything,  it  is  for  the  pretense  that  it  is  any  ally  of  the  class-\nroom.  That,  after  all, has  been  its  chief  claim  on  foundation  and \npublic  money.  As  a  television  show,  and  a  good  one,  \"Sesame \nStreet\"  does  not  encourage  children  to  love  school  or  anything \nabout  school.  It  encourages  them  to  love  television. \nMoreover,  it  is important  to  add  that  whether  or  not  \"Sesame \nStreet\"  teaches  children  their  letters  and  numbers  is  entirely  ir-\nrelevant.  We  may  take  as  our  guide  here  John  Dewey's  observa-\ntion  that  the  content  of  a  lesson  is  the  least  important  thing \nabout  learning.  As  he  wrote  in  Experience  and  Education:  \"Per-\nhaps  the  greatest  of  all  pedagogical  fallacies  is the  notion  that  a \nperson  learns  only  what  he  is  studying  at  the  time.  Collateral \nlearning  in  the  way  of  formation  of  enduring  attitudes  .  . . may \nbe and  often  is  more  important  than  the  spelling  lesson  or \nlesson  in  geography  or  history.  .  . .  For  these  attitudes  are  fun-\ndamentally  what  count  in  the  future.\"1  In  other  words,  the \nmost  important  thing  one  learns  is  always  something  about  how \none  learns.  As  Dewey  wrote  in  another  place,  we  learn  what \nwe do.  Television  educates  by  teaching  children  to  do  what \ntelevision-viewing  requires  of  them.  And  that  is  as precisely  re-\nmote  from  what  a  classroom  requires  of  them  as  reading  a book \nis from  watching  a  stage  show. \nAlthough  one  would  not  know  it  from  consulting  various  re-\ncent  proposals  on  how  to  mend  the  educational  system,  this \npoint—that  reading  books  and  watching  television  differ  en-\n\f\nTeaching as an Amusing  Activity 145 \ntirely in what  they  imply  about  learning—is  the  primary  educa-\ntional  issue  in  America  today.  America  is,  in  fact,  the  leading \ncase in  point  of  what  may  be  thought  of  as  the  third  great  crisis \nin Western  education.  The  first  occurred  in  the  fifth  century \nB.C., when  Athens  underwent  a  change  from  an  oral  culture  to \nan alphabet-writing  culture.  To  understand  what  this  meant, \nwe must  read  Plato. The second  occurred  in  the  sixteenth  cen-\ntury,  when  Europe  underwent  a  radical  transformation  as  a  re-\nsult of  the  printing  press.  To  understand  what  this  meant,  we \nmust  read  John  Locke.  The  third  is  happening  now,  in  America, \nas a  result  of  the  electronic  revolution,  particularly  the  in-\nvention  of  television.  To  understand  what  this  means,  we  must \nread Marshall  McLuhan. \nWe face  the  rapid  dissolution  of  the  assumptions  of  an educa-\ntion organized  around  the  slow-moving  printed  word,  and  the \nequally  rapid  emergence  of  a  new  education  based  on  the \nspeed-of-light  electronic  image.  The  classroom  is,  at  the  mo-\nment,  still  tied  to  the  printed  word,  although  that  connection  is \nrapidly  weakening.  Meanwhile,  television  forges  ahead,  mak-\ning no  concessions  to  its  great  technological  predecessor,  creat-\ning new  conceptions  of  knowledge  and  how  it  is acquired.  One \nis entirely  justified  in  saying  that  the  major  educational  enter-\nprise now  being  undertaken  in  the  United  States  is not  happen-\ning in  its  classrooms  but  in  the  home,  in  front  of the  television \nset, and  under  the  jurisdiction  not  of  school  administrators  and \nteachers  but  of  network  executives  and  entertainers.  I  don't \nmean  to  imply  that  the  situation  is  a  result  of  a  conspiracy  or \neven  that  those  who  control  television  want  this  responsibility.  I \nmean  only  to  say  that,  like  the  alphabet  or  the  printing  press, \ntelevision  has  by  its  power  to  control  the  time,  attention  and \ncognitive  habits  of  our  youth  gained  the  power  to  control  their \neducation. \nThis is why  I  think  it  accurate  to  call  television  a  curriculum. \nAs I  understand  the  word,  a  curriculum  is  a  specially  con-\nstructed  information  system  whose  purpose  is  to  influence,\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to Death 146 \nteach,  train  òr  cultivate  the  mind  and  character  of youth.  Televi-\nsion,  of  course,  does  exactly  that,  and  does  it  relentlessly.  In  so \ndoing,  it  competes  successfully  with  the  school  curriculum.  By \nwhich  I  mean,  it  damn  near  obliterates  it. \nHaving  devoted  an  earlier  book,  Teaching  as a Conserving Ac-\ntivity, to  a detailed  examination  of  the  antagonistic  nature  of the \ntwo  curriculums—television  and  school—I  will  not  burden  the \nreader  or  myself  with  a  repetition  of  that  analysis.  But  I  would \nlike to  recall  two  points  that  I  feel  I  did  not  express  forcefully \nenough  in  that  book  and  that  happen  to  be  central  to  this  one.  I \nrefer,  first,  to  the  fact  that  television's  principal  contribution  to \neducational  philosophy  is  the  idea  that  teaching  and  entertain-\nment  are  inseparable.  This  entirely  original  conception  is  to  be \nfound  nowhere  in  educational  discourses,  from  Confucius  to \nPlato to  Cicero  to  Locke  to  John  Dewey.  In  searching  the  liter-\nature  of  education,  you  will  find  it  said  by  some  that  children \nwill learn  best  when  they  are  interested  in  what  they  are  learn-\ning. You  will  find  it  said—Plato  and  Dewey  emphasized  this \n—that  reason  is  best cultivated  when  it  is rooted  in  robust  emo-\ntional  ground.  You  will  even  find  some  who  say  that  learning  is \nbest facilitated  by  a  loving  and  benign  teacher.  But  no  one  has \never said  or  implied  that  significant  learning  is  effectively,  dura-\nbly and  truthfully  achieved  when  education  is  entertainment. \nEducation  philosophers  have  assumed  that  becoming  accultur-\nated  is  difficult  because  it  necessarily  involves  the  imposition  of \nrestraints.  They  have  argued  that  there  must  be  a  sequence  to \nlearning,  that  perseverance  and  a  certain  measure  of  perspi-\nration  are  indispensable,  that  individual  pleasures  must  fre-\nquently  be  submerged  in  the  interests  of  group  cohesion,  and \nthat  learning  to  be  critical  and  to  think  conceptually  and  rigor-\nously  do  not  come  easily  to  the  young  but  are  hard-fought  vic-\ntories.  Indeed,  Cicero  remarked  that  the  purpose  of education  is \nto free  the  student  from  the  tyranny  of  the  present,  which  can-\nnot be  pleasurable  for  those,  like  the  young,  who  are  struggling\n\f\nTeaching as an Amusing  Activity 147 \nhard  to  do  the  opposite—that  is,  accommodate  themselves  to \nthe present. \nTelevision  offers  a delicious  and,  as  I  have  said,  original  al-\nternative  to  all  of  this.  We  might  say  there  are  three  com-\nmandments  that  form  the  philosophy  of  the  education  which \ntelevision  offers.  The  influence  of  these  commandments  is  ob-\nservable  in  every  type  of  television  programming—from  \"Ses-\name  Street\"  to  the  documentaries  of  \"Nova\"  and  \"The  National \nGeographic\"  to  \"Fantasy  Island\"  to  MTV.  The  commandments \nare as  follows: \nThou shalt  have  no  prerequisites \nEvery television  program  must  be  a  complete  package  in  itself. \nNo previous  knowledge  is  to  be  required.  There  must  not  be \neven  a hint  that  learning  is  hierarchical,  that  it  is an edifice  con-\nstructed  on  a  foundation.  The  learner  must  be  allowed  to  enter \nat any  point  without  prejudice.  This  is why  you  shall  never  hear \nor see  a  television  program  begin  with  the  caution  that  if  the \nviewer  has  not  seen  the  previous  programs,  this  one  will  be \nmeaningless.  Television  is  a  nongraded  curriculum  and  ex-\ncludes  no  viewer  for  any  reason,  at  any  time.  In  other  words,  in \ndoing  away  with  the  idea  of  sequence  and  continuity  in  educa-\ntion,  television  undermines  the  idea  that  sequence  and  con-\ntinuity  have  anything  to  do  with  thought  itself. \nThou shalt  induce  no  perplexity \nIn television  teaching,  perplexity  is  a superhighway  to  low  rat-\nings. A  perplexed  learner  is  a learner  who  will  turn  to  another \nstation.  This  means  that  there  must  be  nothing  that  has  to  be \nremembered,  studied,  applied  or,  worst  of  all,  endured.  It  is \nassumed  that  any  information,  story  or  idea  can  be  made  imme-\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to  Death 148 \ndiately  accessible,  since  the  contentment,  not  the  growth,  of  the \nlearner  is  paramount. \nThou shalt  avoid  exposition  like  the  ten  plagues \nvisited upon  Egypt \nOf all  the  enemies  of  television-teaching,  including  continuity \nand  perplexity,  none  is  more  formidable  than  exposition.  Argu-\nments,  hypotheses,  discussions,  reasons,  refutations  or  any  of \nthe  traditional  instruments  of  reasoned  discourse  turn  television \ninto  radio  or,  worse,  third-rate  printed  matter.  Thus,  television-\nteaching  always  takes  the  form  of  story-telling,  conducted \nthrough  dynamic  images  and  supported  by  music.  This  is  as \ncharacteristic  of  \"Star  Trek\"  as  it  is  of  \"Cosmos,\"  of  \"Diff'rent \nStrokes\"  as  of  \"Sesame  Street,\"  of  commercials  as  of  \"Nova.\" \nNothing  will  be  taught  on  television  that  cannot  be  both  visu-\nalized  and  placed  in  a  theatrical  context. \nThe name  we  may  properly  give  to  an  education  without \nprerequisites,  perplexity  and  exposition  is  entertainment.  And \nwhen  one  considers  that  save  for  sleeping  there  is  no  activ-\nity that  occupies  more  of  an  American  youth's  time  than \ntelevision-viewing,  we  cannot  avoid  the  conclusion  that  a  mas-\nsive reorientation  toward  learning  is  now  taking  place.  Which \nleads  to  the  second  point  I  wish  to  emphasize:  The  conse-\nquences  of  this  reorientation  are  to  be  observed  not  only  in  the \ndecline  of  the  potency  of  the  classroom  but,  paradoxically,  in \nthe  refashioning  of the  classroom  into  a place  where  both  teach-\ning and  learning  are  intended  to  be  vastly  amusing  activities. \nI have  already  referred  to  the  experiment  in  Philadelphia in \nwhich  the  classroom  is  reconstituted  as  a rock  concert.  But  this \nis only  the  silliest  example  of  an  attempt  to  define  education \nas a  mode  of  entertainment.  Teachers,  from  primary  grades \nthrough  college,  are  increasing  the  visual  stimulation  of  their \nlessons;  are  reducing  the  amount  of  exposition  their  students \nmust  cope  with;  are  relying  less  on  reading  and  writing  assign-\n\f\nTeaching as an Amusing  Activity 149 \nments;  and  are  reluctantly  concluding  that  the  principal  means \nby which  student  interest  may  be  engaged  is  entertainment. \nWith  no  difficulty  I could  fill the  remaining  pages  of this  chapter \nwith  examples  of  teachers'  efforts—in  some  instances,  uncon-\nscious—to  make  their  classrooms  into  second-rate  television \nshows.  But  I  will rest  my  case  with  \"The  Voyage  of  the  Mimi,\" \nwhich  may  be  taken  as  a synthesis,  if  not  an  apotheosis,  of  the \nNew Education.  \"The  Voyage  of  the  Mimi\"  is  the  name  of  an \nexpensive  science  and  mathematics  project  that  has  brought  to-\ngether  some  of  the  most  prestigious  institutions  in  the  field  of \neducation—the  United  States  Department  of  Education,  the \nBank Street  College  of  Education,  the  Public Broadcasting  Sys-\ntem, and  the  publishing  firm  Holt,  Rinehart  and  Winston.  The \nproject  was  made  possible  by  a  $3.65  million  grant  from  the \nDepartment  of  Education,  which  is  always  on  the  alert  to  put  its \nmoney  where  the  future  is.  And  the  future  is  \"The  Voyage  of \nthe Mimi.\"  To  describe  the  project  succinctly,  I  quote  from  four \nparagraphs  in  The  New York  Times of August  7,  1984: \nOrganized around  a  twenty-six-unit  television  series that  depicts \nthe adventures  of a floating whale-research  laboratory,  [the  pro-\nject] combines  television viewing  with  lavishly illustrated  books \nand computer  games  that  simulate  the  way  scientists and  navi-\ngators work. .  . . \n\"The Voyage of the Mimi\" is built around  fifteen-minute televi-\nsion programs  that  depict  the  adventures  of  four  young  people \nwho accompany two  scientists and a crusty sea captain on a voy-\nage to monitor the behavior of humpback  whales  off the coast of \nMaine. The crew of the converted tuna  trawler  navigates the ship, \ntracks down the  whales and struggles to survive on an  uninhab-\nited island after  a storm damages the ship's hull. . . . \nEach dramatic episode is then followed by a fifteen-minute doc-\numentary on  related  themes.  One  such  documentary  involved  a \nvisit by one of the teen-age  actors to Ted Taylor, a nuclear  phys-\nicist in  Greenport,  L.I., who  has  devised a  way  of  purifying  sea \nwater by freezing it.\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to  Death 150 \nThe television programs, which  teachers are free to record off \nthe air and use at their convenience, are supplemented by a series \nof books  and  computer  exercises  that  pick  up  four  academic \nthemes that emerge naturally from the story line: map and naviga-\ntional skills,  whales  and  their  environment, ecological  systems \nand computer literacy. \nThe television  programs  have  been  broadcast  over  PBS; the \nbooks  and  computer  software  have  been  provided  by  Holt, \nRinehart  and  Winston;  the  educational  expertise  by  the  faculty \nof the  Bank  Street  College.  Thus,  \"The  Voyage  of  the  Mimi\"  is \nnot  to  be  taken  lightly.  As  Frank  Withrow  of  the  Department  of \nEducation  remarked,  \"We  consider  it  the  flagship  of  what  we \nare doing.  It  is a model  that  others  will  begin  to  follow.\"  Every-\none  involved  in  the  project  is  enthusiastic,  and  extraordinary \nclaims  of  its  benefits  come  trippingly  from  their  tongues.  Janice \nTrebbi  Richards  of  Holt,  Rinehart  and  Winston  asserts,  \"Re-\nsearch  shows  that  learning  increases  when  information  is  pre-\nsented  in  a  dramatic  setting,  and  television  can  do  this  better \nthan  any  other  medium.\"  Officials  of  the  Department  of  Ed-\nucation  claim  that  the  appeal  of  integrating  three  media— \ntelevision,  print,  and  computers—lies  in  their  potential  for \ncultivating  higher-order  thinking  skills.  And  Mr.  Withrow  is \nquoted  as  saying  that  projects  like  \"The  Voyage  of  the  Mimi\" \ncould  mean  great  financial  savings,  that  in  the  long  run  \"it  is \ncheaper  than  anything  else  we  do.\"  Mr.  Withrow  also  sug-\ngested  that  there  are  many  ways  of  financing  such  projects. \n\"With  'Sesame  Street,'\"  he  said,  \"it  took  five  or  six  years,  but \neventually  you  can  start  bringing  in  the  money  with  T-shirts \nand  cookie  jars.\" \nWe may  start  thinking  about  what  \"The  Voyage  of the  Mimi\" \nsignifies  by  recalling  that  the  idea  is  far  from  original.  What  is \nhere  referred  to  as  \"integrating  three  media\"  or  a \"multi-media \npresentation\"  was  once  called  \"audio-visual  aids,\"  used  by \nteachers  for  years,  usually  for  the  modest  purpose  of  enhancing\n\f\nTeaching as an Amusing  Activity 151 \nstudent  interest  in  the  curriculum.  Moreover,  several  years  ago, \nthe Office  of  Education  (as  the  Department  was  then  called) \nsupplied  funds  to  WNET  for  a similarly  designed  project  called \n\"Watch  Your  Mouth,\"  a  series  of  television  dramatizations  in \nwhich  young  people  inclined  to  misuse  the  English  language \nfumbled  their  way  through  a  variety  of  social  problems.  Lin-\nguists  and  educators  prepared  lessons  for  teachers  to  use  in \nconjunction  with  each  program.  The  dramatizations  were  com-\npelling—although  not  nearly  as  good  as  \"Welcome  Back,  Kot-\nter,\"  which  had  the  unassailable  advantage  of  John  Travolta's \ncharisma—but  there  exists  no  evidence  that  students  who  were \nrequired  to  view  \"Watch  Your  Mouth\"  increased  their  compe-\ntence  in  the  use  of  the  English  language.  Indeed,  since  there  is \nno shortage  of mangled  English  on  everyday  commercial  televi-\nsion,  one  wondered  at  the  time  why  the  United  States  govern-\nment  would  have  paid  anyone  to  go  to  the  trouble  of producing \nadditional  ineptitudes  as  a  source  of  classroom  study.  A  vid-\neotape  of  any  of  David  Susskind's  programs  would  provide  an \nEnglish  teacher  with  enough  linguistic  aberrations  to  fill  a  se-\nmester's  worth  of  analysis. \nNonetheless,  the  Department  of  Education  has  forged  ahead, \napparently  in  the  belief  that  ample  evidence—to  quote  Ms. \nRichards  again—\"shows  that  learning  increases  when  informa-\ntion is  presented  in  a  dramatic  setting,  and  that  television  can \ndo this  better  than  any  other  medium.\"  The  most  charitable \nresponse  to  this  claim  is  that  it  is misleading.  George  Comstock \nand his  associates  have  reviewed  2,800  studies  on  the  general \ntopic  of  television's  influence  on  behavior,  including  cognitive \nprocessing,  and  are  unable  to  point  to  persuasive  evidence  that \n\"learning  increases  when  information  is  presented  in  a  dra-\nmatic  setting.\"2  Indeed,  in  studies  conducted  by  Cohen  and  Sa-\nlomon;  Meringoff;  Jacoby,  Hoyer  and  Sheluga;  Stauffer,  Frost \nand Rybolt;  Stern;  Wilson;  Neuman;  Katz,  Adoni  and  Parness; \nand Gunter,  quite  the  opposite  conclusion  is  justified.3  Jacoby \net al.  found,  for  example,  that  only  3.5  percent  of  viewers  were\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to Death 152 \nable  to  answer  successfully  twelve  true/false  questions  concern-\ning two  thirty-second  segments  of  commercial  television  pro-\ngrams  and  advertisements.  Stauffer  et  al.  found  in  studying \nstudents'  responses  to  a  news  program  transmitted  via  televi-\nsion,  radio  and  print,  that  print  significantly  increased  correct \nresponses  to  questions  regarding  the  names  of people  and  num-\nbers contained  in  the  material.  Stern  reported  that  51  percent  of \nviewers  could  not  recall  a  single  item  of  news  a  few  minutes \nafter  viewing  a  news  program  on  television.  Wilson  found  that \nthe average  television  viewer  could  retain  only  20  percent  of the \ninformation  contained  in  a  fictional  televised  news  story.  Katz \net al. found  that  21  percent  of  television  viewers  could  not  recall \nany news  items  within  one  hour  of  broadcast.  On  the  basis  of \nhis and  other  studies,  Salomon  has  concluded  that  \"the  mean-\nings secured  from  television  are  more  likely  to  be  segmented, \nconcrete  and  less  inferential,  and  those  secured  from  reading \nhave  a  higher  likelihood  of  being  better  tied  to  one's  stored \nknowledge  and  thus  are  more  likely  to  be inferential.\"4  In  other \nwords,  so  far  as  many  reputable  studies  are  concerned,  televi-\nsion viewing  does  not  significantly  increase  learning,  is  inferior \nto and  less  likely  than  print  to  cultivate  higher-order,  inferential \nthinking. \nBut one  must  not  make  too  much  of  the  rhetoric  of  grants-\nmanship.  We  are  all  inclined  to  transform  our  hopes  into  ten-\nuous  claims  when  an  important  project  is  at  stake.  Besides,  I \nhave  no  doubt  that  Ms.  Richards  can  direct  us  to  several  studies \nthat  lend  support  to  her  enthusiasm.  The  point  is  that  if  you \nwant  money  for  the  redundant  purpose  of  getting  children  to \nwatch  even  more  television  than  they  already  do—and  drama-\ntizations  at  that—you  have  to  escalate  the  rhetoric  to  Herculean \nproportions. \nWhat  is  of  greatest  significance  about  \"The  Voyage  of  the \nMimi\"  is  that  the  content  selected  was  obviously  chosen  be-\ncause  it  is eminently  televisible.  Why are  these  students  studying \nthe behavior  of  humpback  whales?  How  critical  is  it  that  the\n\f\nTeaching as an Amusing  Activity 153 \n\"academic  themes\"  of  navigational  and  map-reading  skills  be \nlearned?  Navigational  skills  have  never  been  considered  an  \"ac-\nademic  theme\"  and  in  fact  seem  singularly  inappropriate  for \nmost  students  in  big  cities.  Why  has  it  been  decided  that \n\"whales  and  their  environment\"  is  a subject  of such  compelling \ninterest  that  an  entire  year's  work  should  be  given  to  it? \nI would  suggest  that  \"The  Voyage  of  the  Mimi\"  was  con-\nceived by  someone's  asking  the  question,  What  is  television \ngood for?,  not,  What  is  education  good  for?  Television  is  good \nfor dramatizations,  shipwrecks,  seafaring  adventures,  crusty  old \nsea captains,  and  physicists  being  interviewed  by  actor-\ncelebrities.  And  that,  of  course,  is  what  we  have  got  in  \"The \nVoyage of  the  Mimi.\"  The  fact  that  this  adventure  sit-com  is \naccompanied  by  lavishly  illustrated  books  and  computer  games \nonly underscores  that  the  television  presentation  controls  the \ncurriculum.  The  books  whose  pictures  the  students  will  scan \nand the  computer  games  the  students  will  play  are  dictated  by \nthe content  of  the  television  shows,  not  the  other  way  around. \nBooks,  it  would  appear,  have  now  become  an  audio-visual  aid; \nthe principal  carrier  of  the  content  of  education  is  the  television \nshow,  and  its  principal  claim  for  a preeminent  place  in  the  cur-\nriculum is  that  it  is entertaining.  Of  course,  a  television  produc-\ntion can  be  used  to  stimulate  interest  in  lessons,  or  even  as  the \nfocal point  of  a  lesson.  But  what  is  happening  here  is  that \nthe content  of  the  school  curriculum  is  being  determined  by  the \ncharacter  of  television,  and  even  worse,  that  character  is  appar-\nently  not  included  as  part  of  what  is  studied.  One  would  have \nthought  that  the  school  room  is  the  proper  place  for  students  to \ninquire  into  the  ways  in  which  media  of  all  kinds—including \ntelevision—shape  people's  attitudes  and  perceptions.  Since  our \nstudents  will  have  watched  approximately  sixteen  thousand \nhours  of  television  by  high  school's  end,  questions  should  have \narisen,  even  in  the  minds  of  officials  at  the  Department  of  Edu-\ncation,  about  who  will  teach  our  students  how  to  look  at  televi-\nsion,  and  when  not  to,  and  with  what  critical  equipment  when\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to Death 154 \nthey  do.  \"The  Voyage  of the  Mimi\"  project  bypasses  these  ques-\ntions;  indeed,  hopes  that  the  students  will  immerse  themselves \nin the  dramatizations  in  the  same  frame  of  mind  used  when \nwatching  \"St.  Elsewhere\"  or  \"Hill  Street  Blues.\"  (One  may  also \nassume  that  what  is  called  \"computer  literacy\"  does  not  involve \nraising  questions  about  the  cognitive  biases  and  social  effects  of \nthe computer,  which,  I  would  venture,  are  the  most  important \nquestions  to  address  about  new  technologies.) \n\"The  Voyage  of  the  Mimi,\"  in  other  words,  spent  $3.65  mil-\nlion for  the  purpose  of  using  media  in  exactly  the  manner  that \nmedia  merchants  want  them  to  be used—mindlessly  and  invisi-\nbly, as  if media  themselves  have  no  epistemological  or  political \nagenda.  And,  in  the  end,  what  will  the  students  have  learned? \nThey will,  to  be  sure,  have  learned  something  about  whales, \nperhaps  about  navigation  and  map  reading,  most  of which  they \ncould  have  learned  just  as  well  by  other  means.  Mainly,  they \nwill have  learned  that  learning  is  a  form  of  entertainment  or, \nmore  precisely,  that  anything  worth  learning  can  take  the  form \nof an  entertainment,  and  ought  to.  And  they  will  not  rebel  if \ntheir  English  teacher  asks  them  to  learn  the  eight  parts  of speech \nthrough  the  medium  of  rock  music.  Or  if  their  social  studies \nteacher  sings  to them  the  facts  about  the  War  of 1812.  Or if their \nphysics  comes  to  them  on  cookies  and  T-shirts.  Indeed,  they \nwill expect  it  and  thus  will  be  well  prepared  to  receive  their \npolitics,  their  religion,  their  news  and  their  commerce  in  the \nsame  delightful  way."

    "raw_text": "There  are  two  ways  by  which  the  spirit  of  a  culture  may  be \nshriveled.  In  the  first—the  Orwellian—culture  becomes  a \nprison.  In  the  second—the  Huxleyan—culture  becomes  a  bur-\nlesque. \nNo one  needs  to  be  reminded  that  our  world  is  now  marred \nby many  prison-cultures  whose  structure  Orwell  described  ac-\ncurately  in  his  parables.  If  one  were  to  read  both  1984  and  Ani-\nmal Farm,  and  then  for  good  measure,  Arthur  Koestler's \nDarkness at Noon,  one  would  have  a  fairly  precise  blueprint  of \nthe machinery  of  thought-control  as  it  currently  operates  in \nscores of countries  and  on  millions  of people.  Of  course,  Orwell \nwas not  the  first  to  teach  us  about  the  spiritual  devastations \nof tyranny.  What  is  irreplaceable  about  his  work  is  his  in-\nsistence  that  it  makes  little  difference  if  our  wardens  are  in-\nspired by  right-  or  left-wing  ideologies.  The  gates  of  the  prison \nare equally  impenetrable,  surveillance  equally  rigorous,  icon-\nworship  equally  pervasive. \nWhat  Huxley  teaches  is  that  in  the  age  of  advanced  technol-\nogy, spiritual  devastation  is  more  likely  to  come  from  an enemy \nwith  a  smiling  face  than  from  one  whose  countenance  exudes \nsuspicion  and  hate.  In  the  Huxleyan  prophecy,  Big  Brother  does \nnot watch  us,  by his  choice.  We  watch  him,  by  ours.  There  is no \nneed  for  wardens  or  gates  or  Ministries  of Truth.  When  a  popu-\nlation  becomes  distracted  by  trivia,  when  cultural  life  is  re-\ndefined  as  a  perpetual  round  of  entertainments,  when  serious \npublic  conversation  becomes  a  form  of  baby-talk,  when,  in \n155 \nThe Huxleyan Warning \n11.\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to Death 156 \nshort,  a  people  become  an  audience  and  their  public  business  a \nvaudeville  act,  then  a  nation  finds  itself  at  risk;  culture-death  is \na clear  possibility. \nIn America,  Orwell's  prophecies  are  of  small  relevance,  but \nHuxley's  are  well  under  way  toward  being  realized.  For  Amer-\nica is  engaged  in  the  world's  most  ambitious  experiment  to \naccommodate  itself  to  the  technological  distractions  made  pos-\nsible by  the  electric  plug.  This  is  an  experiment  that  began \nslowly  and  modestly  in  the  mid-nineteenth  century  and  has \nnow,  in  the  latter  half  of  the  twentieth,  reached  a  perverse  ma-\nturity  in  America's  consuming  love-affair  with  television.  As \nnowhere  else  in  the  world,  Americans  have  moved  far  and  fast \nin bringing  to  a close  the  age  of the  slow-moving  printed  word, \nand have  granted  to  television  sovereignty  over  all  of  their  in-\nstitutions.  By  ushering  in  the  Age  of  Television,  America  has \ngiven  the  world  the  clearest  available  glimpse  of  the  Huxleyan \nfuture. \nThose  who  speak  about  this  matter  must  often  raise  their \nvoices  to  a  near-hysterical  pitch,  inviting  the  charge  that  they \nare everything  from  wimps  to  public  nuisances  to  Jeremiahs. \nBut they  do  so  because  what  they  want  others  to  see  appears \nbenign,  when  it  is not  invisible  altogether.  An  Orwellian  world \nis much  easier  to  recognize,  and  to  oppose,  than  a  Huxleyan. \nEverything  in  our  background  has  prepared  us  to  know  and \nresist a  prison  when  the  gates  begin  to  close  around  us.  We  are \nnot likely,  for  example,  to  be  indifferent  to  the  voices  of  the \nSakharovs  and  the  Timmermans  and  the  Walesas.  We  take \narms  against  such  a  sea  of  troubles,  buttressed  by  the  spirit  of \nMilton,  Bacon,  Voltaire,  Goethe  and  Jefferson.  But  what  if there \nare no  cries  of  anguish  to  be  heard?  Who  is  prepared  to  take \narms  against  a  sea  of  amusements?  To  whom  do  we  complain, \nand  when,  and  in  what  tone  of  voice,  when  serious  discourse \ndissolves  into  giggles?  What  is  the  antidote  to  a  culture's  being \ndrained  by  laughter? \nI fear  that  our  philosophers  have  given  us  no  guidance  in  this\n\f\nThe Huxleyan Warning 157 \nmatter.  Their  warnings  have  customarily  been  directed  against \nthose  consciously  formulated  ideologies  that  appeal  to  the \nworst  tendencies  in  human  nature.  But  what  is  happening  in \nAmerica  is  not  the  design  of  an  articulated  ideology.  No  Mein \nKampf or  Communist  Manifesto  announced  its  coming.  It  comes \nas the  unintended  consequence  of  a  dramatic  change  in  our \nmodes  of public  conversation.  But  it is an ideology  nonetheless, \nfor it imposes  a  way  of  life,  a set  of relations  among  people  and \nideas,  about  which  there  has  been  no  consensus,  no  discussion \nand no  opposition.  Only  compliance.  Public consciousness  has \nnot yet  assimilated  the  point  that  technology  is  ideology.  This, \nin spite  of  the  fact  that  before  our  very  eyes  technology  has \naltered  every  aspect  of  life  in  America  during  the  past  eighty \nyears.  For  example,  it  would  have  been  excusable  in 1905  for  us \nto be unprepared  for  the  cultural  changes  the  automobile  would \nbring.  Who  could  have  suspected  then  that  the  automobile \nwould  tell  us  how  we  were  to  conduct  our  social  and  sexual \nlives? Would  reorient  our  ideas  about  what  to  do  with  our  for-\nests and  cities?  Would  create  new  ways  of  expressing  our  per-\nsonal  identity  and  social  standing? \nBut it  is  much  later  in  the  game  now,  and  ignorance  of  the \nscore is  inexcusable.  To  be  unaware  that  a  technology  comes \nequipped  with  a  program  for  social  change,  to  maintain  that \ntechnology  is  neutral,  to  make  the  assumption  that  technology \nis always  a  friend  to  culture  is,  at  this  late  hour,  stupidity  plain \nand simple.  Moreover,  we  have  seen  enough  by  now  to  know \nthat  technological  changes  in  our  modes  of  communication  are \neven  more  ideology-laden  than  changes  in  our  modes  of  trans-\nportation.  Introduce  the  alphabet  to  a  culture  and  you  change \nits cognitive  habits,  its  social  relations,  its  notions  of  commu-\nnity,  history  and  religion.  Introduce  the  printing  press  with \nmovable  type,  and  you  do  the  same.  Introduce  speed-of-light \ntransmission  of  images  and  you  make  a  cultural  revolution. \nWithout  a vote.  Without  polemics.  Without  guerrilla  resistance. \nHere is  ideology,  pure  if  not  serene.  Here  is  ideology  without\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to Death 158 \nwords,  and  all  the  more  powerful  for  their  absence.  AH that  is \nrequired  to  make  it  stick  is  a population  that  devoutly  believes \nin the  inevitability  of  progress.  And  in  this  sense,  all  Americans \nare Marxists,  for  we believe  nothing  if not  that  history  is moving \nus toward  some  preordained  paradise  and  that  technology  is  the \nforce  behind  that  movement. \nThus,  there  are  near  insurmountable  difficulties  for  anyone \nwho  has  written  such  a  book  as  this,  and  who  wishes  to  end  it \nwith  some  remedies  for  the  affliction.  In  the  first  place,  not \neveryone  believes  a  cure  is  needed,  and  in  the  second,  there \nprobably  isn't  any.  But  as  a  true-blue  American  who  has  im-\nbibed  the  unshakable  belief  that  where  there  is a problem,  there \nmust  be  a  solution,  I  shall  conclude  with  the  following  sugges-\ntions. \nWe must,  as  a  start,  not  delude  ourselves  with  preposterous \nnotions  such  as  the  straight  Luddite  position  as  outlined,  for \nexample,  in  Jerry  Mander's  Four  Arguments for  the  Elimination of \nTelevision. Americans  will  not  shut  down  any  part  of  their  tech-\nnological  apparatus,  and  to  suggest  that  they  do  so  is  to  make \nno suggestion  at  all.  It  is  almost  equally  unrealistic  to  expect \nthat  nontrivial  modifications  in  the  availability  of  media  will \never  be  made.  Many  civilized  nations  limit  by  law  the  amount \nof hours  television  may  operate  and  thereby  mitigate  the  role \ntelevision  plays  in  public  life.  But  I  believe  that  this  is  not  a \npossibility  in  America.  Once  having  opened  the  Happy  Medium \nto full  public  view,  we  are  not  likely  to  countenance  even  its \npartial  closing.  Still,  some  Americans  have  been  thinking  along \nthese  lines.  As  I  write,  a  story  appears  in  The  New  York  Times \n(September  27,  1984)  about  the  plans  of the  Farmington,  Con-\nnecticut,  Library  Council  to  sponsor  a  \"TV  Turnoff.\"  It appears \nthat  such  an  effort  was  made  the  previous  year,  the  idea  being \nto get  people  to  stop  watching  television  for  one  month.  The \nTimes reports  that  the  turnoff  the  previous  January  was  widely \nnoted  by  the  media.  Ms.  Ellen  Babcock,  whose  family  partici-\npated,  is  quoted  as  saying,  \"It  will  be  interesting  to  see  if  the"

    "raw_text": "The Huxleyan Warning 159 \nimpact  is  the  same  this  year  as  last  year,  when  we  had  terrific \nmedia  coverage.\"  In  other  words,  Ms.  Babcock  hopes  that  by \nwatching  television,  people  will  learn  that  they  ought  to  stop \nwatching  television.  It  is hard  to  imagine  that  Ms.  Babcock  does \nnot see  the  irony  in  this  position.  It  is an  irony  that  I  have  con-\nfronted  many  times  in  being  told  that  I  must  appear  on  televi-\nsion to  promote  a  book  that  warns  people  against  television. \nSuch are  the  contradictions  of  a television-based  culture. \nIn any  case,  of how  much  help  is a one-month  turnoff?  It is a \nmere  pittance;  that  is to say,  a penance.  How  comforting  it must \nbe when  the  folks  in  Farmington  are  done  with  their  punish-\nment  and  can  return  to  their  true  occupation.  Nonetheless,  one \napplauds  their  effort,  as one  must  applaud  the  efforts  of those \nwho  see  some  relief  in  limiting  certain  kinds  of content  on  tele-\nvision—for  example,  excessive  violence,  commercials  on  chil-\ndren's  shows,  etc.  I  am  particularly  fond  of  John  Lindsay's \nsuggestion  that  political  commercials  be  banned  from  television \nas we now  ban  cigarette  and  liquor  commercials.  I  would  gladly \ntestify  before  the  Federal  Communications  Commission  as  to \nthe manifold  merits  of  this  excellent  idea.  To  those  who  would \noppose  my  testimony  by  claiming  that  such  a  ban  is  a  clear \nviolation  of  the  First  Amendment,  I  would  offer  a compromise: \nRequire  all  political  commercials  to  be  preceded  by  a  short \nstatement  to  the  effect  that  common  sense  has  determined  that \nwatching  political  commercials  is  hazardous  to  the  intellectual \nhealth  of  the  community. \nI am  not  very  optimistic  about  anyone's  taking  this  sugges-\ntion seriously.  Neither  do  I  put  much  stock  in  proposals  to  im-\nprove  the  quality  of  television  programs.  Television,  as  I  have \nimplied  earlier,  serves  us  most  usefully  when  presenting  junk-\nentertainment;  it  serves  us  most  ill  when  it  co-opts  serious \nmodes  of  discourse—news,  politics,  science,  education,  com-\nmerce,  religion—and  turns  them  into  entertainment  packages. \nWe would  all  be  better  off  if  television  got  worse,  not  better.\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to Death 160 \n\"The  A-Team\"  and  \"Cheers\"  are  no  threat  to  our  public  health. \n\"60  Minutes,\"  \"Eye-Witness  News\"  and  \"Sesame  Street\"  are. \nThe problem,  in  any  case,  does  not  reside  in  what  people \nwatch.  The  problem  is  in  that  we  watch.  The  solution  must  be \nfound  in  how  we  watch.  For  I  believe  it  may  fairly  be  said  that \nwe have  yet  to  learn  what  television  is.  And  the  reason  is  that \nthere  has  been  no  worthwhile  discussion,  let  alone  widespread \npublic  understanding,  of  what  information  is  and  how  it  gives \ndirection  to  a  culture.  There  is  a certain  poignancy  in  this,  since \nthere  are  no  people  who  more  frequently  and  enthusiastically \nuse such  phrases  as  \"the  information  age,\"  \"the  information \nexplosion,\"  and  \"the  information  society.\"  We  have  apparently \nadvanced  to  the  point  where  we  have  grasped  the  idea  that  a \nchange  in  the  forms,  volume,  speed  and  context  of  information \nmeans something,  but  we  have  not  got  any  further. \nWhat  is  information?  Or  more  precisely,  what  are  informa-\ntion?  What  are  its  various  forms?  What  conceptions  of  intelli-\ngence,  wisdom  and  learning  does  each  form  insist  upon?  What \nconceptions  does  each  form  neglect  or  mock?  What  are  the \nmain  psychic  effects  of each  form?  What  is  the  relation  between \ninformation  and  reason?  What  is  the  kind  of  information  that \nbest facilitates  thinking?  Is  there  a  moral  bias  to  each  informa-\ntion  form?  What  does  it  mean  to  say  that  there  is  too  much \ninformation?  How  would  one  know?  What  redefinitions  of im-\nportant  cultural  meanings  do  new  sources,  speeds,  contexts  and \nforms  of information  require?  Does  television,  for  example,  give \na new  meaning  to  \"piety,\"  to  \"patriotism,\"  to  \"privacy\"?  Does \ntelevision  give  a  new  meaning  to  \"judgment\"  or  to  \"under-\nstanding\"?  How  do  different  forms  of information  persuade?  Is \na newspaper's  \"public\"  different  from  television's  \"public\"? \nHow  do  different  information  forms  dictate  the  type  of  content \nthat  is  expressed? \nThese  questions,  and  dozens  more  like  them,  are  the  means \nthrough  which  it  might  be  possible  for  Americans  to  begin  talk-\ning back  to  their  television  sets,  to  use  Nicholas  Johnson's"

    "raw_text": "The Huxleyan Warning 161 \nphrase.  For  no  medium  is  excessively  dangerous  if  its  users  un-\nderstand  what  its  dangers  are.  It is not  important  that  those  who \nask the  questions  arrive  at  my  answers  or  Marshall  McLuhan's \n(quite  different  answers,  by  the  way).  This  is  an  instance  in \nwhich  the  asking  of the  questions  is  sufficient.  To ask  is  to break \nthe  spell.  To  which  I  might  add  that  questions  about  the  psy-\nchic, political  and  social  effects  of information  are  as  applicable \nto the  computer  as  to  television.  Although  I  believe  the  com-\nputer  to  be  a  vastly  overrated  technology,  I  mention  it  here  be-\ncause,  clearly,  Americans  have  accorded  it  their  customary \nmindless  inattention;  which  means  they  will  use  it  as  they  are \ntold,  without  a  whimper.  Thus,  a  central  thesis  of  computer \ntechnology—that  the  principal  difficulty  we  have  in  solving \nproblems  stems  from  insufficient  data—will  go  unexamined. \nUntil,  years  from  now,  when  it  will  be  noticed  that  the  massive \ncollection  and  speed-of-light  retrieval  of data  have  been  of  great \nvalue  to  large-scale  organizations  but  have  solved  very  little  of \nimportance  to  most  people  and  have  created  at  least  as  many \nproblems  for  them  as  they  may  have  solved. \nIn any  case,  the  point  I  am  trying  to  make  is  that  only \nthrough  a  deep  and  unfailing  awareness  of  the  structure  and \neffects  of  information,  through  a  demystification  of  media,  is \nthere  any  hope  of  our  gaining  some  measure  of  control  over \ntelevision,  or  the  computer,  or  any  other  medium.  How  is  such \nmedia  consciousness  to  be  achieved?  There  are  only  two  an-\nswers  that  come  to  mind,  one  of  which  is  nonsense  and  can  be \ndismissed  almost  at  once;  the  other  is  desperate  but  it  is  all  we \nhave. \nThe nonsensical  answer  is  to  create  television  programs \nwhose  intent  would  be,  not  to  get  people  to  stop  watching  tele-\nvision  but  to  demonstrate  how  television  ought  to  be  viewed,  to \nshow  how  television  recreates  and  degrades  our  conception  of \nnews,  political  debate,  religious  thought,  etc.  I  imagine  such \ndemonstrations  would  of  necessity  take  the  form  of  parodies, \nalong  the  lines  of \"Saturday  Night  Live\"  and  \"Monty  Python,\"\n\f\nAmusing Ourselves  to Death 162 \nthe  idea  being  to  induce  a  nationwide  horse  laugh  over  televi-\nsion's  control  of  public  discourse.  But,  naturally,  television \nwould  have  the  last  laugh.  In  order  to  command  an  audience \nlarge  enough  to  make  a difference,  one  would  have  to  make  the \nprograms  vastly  amusing,  in  the  television  style.  Thus,  the  act  of \ncriticism  itself  would,  in  the  end,  be  co-opted  by  television.  The \nparodists  would  become  celebrities,  would  star  in  movies,  and \nwould  end  up  making  television  commercials. \nThe desperate  answer  is  to  rely  on  the  only  mass  medium  of \ncommunication  that,  in  theory,  is  capable  of  addressing  the \nproblem:  our  schools.  This  is  the  conventional  American  solu-\ntion  to  all dangerous  social  problems,  and  is,  of course,  based  on \na naive  and  mystical  faith  in the  efficacy  of education.  The  pro-\ncess rarely  works.  In  the  matter  at  hand,  there  is  even  less  rea-\nson than  usual  to  expect  it to. Our  schools  have  not  yet  even  got \naround  to  examining  the  role  of  the  printed  word  in  shaping \nour  culture.  Indeed,  you  will  not  find  two  high  school  seniors  in \na hundred  who  could  tell  you—within  a  five-hundred-year \nmargin  of  error—when  the  alphabet  was  invented.  I  suspect \nmost  do  not  even  know  that  the  alphabet  was  invented.  I  have \nfound  that  when  the  question  is  put  to  them,  they  appear \npuzzled,  as  if  one  had  asked,  When  were  trees  invented,  or \nclouds?  It  is  the  very  principle  of  myth,  as  Roland  Barthes \npointed  out,  that  it  transforms  history  into  nature,  and  to  ask  of \nour  schools  that  they  engage  in  the  task  of  de-mythologizing \nmedia  is  to  ask  something  the  schools  have  never  done. \nAnd yet  there  is  reason  to  suppose  that  the  situation  is  not \nhopeless.  Educators  are  not  unaware  of  the  effects  of television \non their  students.  Stimulated  by  the  arrival  of  the  computer, \nthey  discuss  it  a great  deal—which  is  to say,  they  have  become \nsomewhat  \"media  conscious.\"  It  is  true  enough  that  much  of \ntheir  consciousness  centers  on  the  question,  How  can  we  use \ntelevision  (or  the  computer,  or  word  processor)  to  control  edu-\ncation?  They  have  not  yet  got  to  the  question,  How  can  we  use \neducation  to  control  television  (or  the  computer,  or  word  pro-"

Besides,  it  is  an  acknowl-\nedged  task  of  the  schools  to  assist  the  young  in  learning  how  to \ninterpret  the  symbols  of their  culture.  That  this  task  should  now \nrequire  that  they  learn  how  to  distance  themselves  from  their \nforms  of information  is not  so  bizarre  an  enterprise  that  we  can-\nnot hope  for  its  inclusion  in  the  curriculum;  even  hope  that  it \nwill be  placed  at  the  center  of  education. \nWhat  I  suggest  here  as  a solution  is  what  Aldous  Huxley  sug-\ngested,  as well.

On July 20,  1984,  The  New York  Times  reported that the Chinese \nNational Television network had contracted with CBS to broadcast \nsixty-four hours of  CBS programming in  China. Contracts with \nNBC and ABC are sure to follow. One hopes that the Chinese un-\nderstand that such transactions are of great political consequence. \nThe Gang of Four is as nothing compared with the Gang of Three. \n2. This story  was  carried  by  several  newspapers,  including  the \nWisconsin State Journal February 24, 1983,  Section 4, p. 2. \n3.

For an amusing and vitriolic \none, see  Roland  Barthes' \"Billy  Graham at  the  Winter Cyclo-\ndome,\" in The Eiffel Tower and Other Mythologies. Barthes says, \"If \nGod really does speak through the mouth of Dr. Graham, then God \nis a real blockhead.\" \n2.
