    "raw_text": "Introduction\nLife is short.\nHours are passing. Days are passing. Months are passing. Years are passing.\nLet’s say you will live for 100 years. If you’re lucky, the average life\nexpectancy in the world is only 72 years (around 3,700 weeks). It may look\nlike a long time, but it’s not.  And if you are a 30-year-old, you have already\nspent 1,500 weeks. I am telling you this not to make you sad or to give you\nan existential crisis but to make you aware that we don’t have as much time\nas we think we have.\nWe should make the best use of the time we are given. We already know\nthat and have been told that thousands of times, but do we make the best\nuse of our time? Do you love the things that you do? Are you around with\nthe people you love? Life is short for doing the things you hate or not doing\nthe things you want to do. The regret will be huge when you’re old. Imagine\nyou’re almost 80, looking back at things and wishing you did something\ndifferently. You lived a life how you wanted, not how others wanted. You\nwill regret all the moments you wasted being lazy, sitting on a couch\nwatching T.V. for no reason, spending hours daily scrolling social media\nwith no purpose. No person who doesn’t do the things that he wants to can\nbe happy from the inside.\nThink for a few minutes: what would you regret when you’re 80 years\nold?\nHere are a few regrets that you might have:\n1. Not doing what you love.\n2. Being lazy and wasting your time.\n3. Not spending more time with your family.\n4. Not taking care of your health and wellbeing.\n\f\n5. Working hard for nothing in return.\n6. Not traveling when you’re young.\n7. Not enjoying your life to the fullest.\nStop making excuses why you can’t do the things you want to. Stop these\nthings right now. Stop giving answers to your mind; start asking questions.\nIt will force your mind to find a way.\nWasting your time so that time can be perfect is the worst excuse, and\nyou will regret it later. There is no perfect time. The best time is now.\nIf you want to travel the world, now is the best time.\nIf you want to start a business, now is the best time.\nIf you want to go to the gym, now is the best time.\nYou will thank yourself later.\nThe goal should be to live the best we can. And there are so many things\nthat we are doing every day that we will regret in the future.\nThis book will be short. My goal is to make you more aware of your\ndaily actions and how they will impact you in the future. After reading this\nbook, I hope you will stop being so lazy and finally start doing what you\nwant.\nThe book is divided into two parts; the first focuses on your mindset and\nhow you can live a better and more peaceful life, and the second focuses on\ntips and techniques that will help you overcome laziness and boost your\nproductivity.\nTime is running out. Start living now.\nOceanofPDF.com"

    "raw_text": "Part 1\nMindset\n“If you spend your time chasing butterflies, they'll fly away. But if you\nspend time making a beautiful garden, the butterflies will come.\nDon't chase, attract.”\nOceanofPDF.com\n\f\n100% Responsibility\n“The price of greatness is responsibility.”\n–Winston Churchill\nIt’s useless to blame something else for all your problems. You can blame\nyour friends, family, spouse, or anyone else. The good thing that blaming\nothers does is that it makes us feel good from the inside by convincing our\nminds that we can’t do anything in this situation, but that’s wrong. There’s\nalways something that you can do. Even if you can’t change the situation,\nyou can always do the best possible thing.\nBlaming others does nothing. It doesn’t solve your problem. Let’s say\nyou blame your friends, family, job, or anything else for not having enough\ntime to exercise. You can condemn the whole world. All the blame in the\nworld will not help you find time to exercise. If you want to find a solution,\nyou will find it; it’s not that a solution doesn’t exist. It exists, and you know\nit deep inside of your heart. Only action can help you achieve your goals,\nnothing else. No one can help you achieve your goals.\nNobody cares if you’re lazy or not.\nNobody cares if you procrastinate or not.\nNobody cares if you exercise or not.\nWhy would they care? Nobody cares. It would be best for you if you do\nthings for yourself. You must act. You must find time.\nIt is easier to sit on the couch and watch TV than go for a run.\nIt’s easier to scroll on social media than to read a book.\nIt’ easier to procrastinate than to work hard.\n\f\nOur mind always goes towards the easy option. You need to change it to\nchoose the best choice for yourself, not the easy one.\nWe blame all the time to avoid confronting our problems because it’s super\neasy to blame. You blame someone else, and boom, you no longer think that\nmaybe you can do something about it. Every action that you take or not take\nimpacts your life. So, the next time you blame someone else for your\nproblem, consider the consequences. Your future is in the hands of your\npresent actions.\nDon’t even think about the past. It’s already gone. There are only two\nthings that the past can give you: lessons and regrets.\nLearn from the past, but don’t let him have too much control over your\nlife. Learn from your mistakes. There’s nothing wrong with making a\nmistake, but if you keep repeating the same error, there is something wrong.\nDon’t be stupid. Neither love nor hate mistakes. If you hate mistakes, then\nyou become fearful of them. You start to overthink. It destroys your peace\nof mind. It doesn’t allow you to take action. If you love mistakes, you start\nmaking more because you attract what you love.\nIf a mistake happens, learn from it and move on. Don’t waste your time.\nIf you’re not moving forward, you’re making a second mistake.\nHarsh truths of life:\nIf you’re lazy, it’s your fault.\nIf you’re unhappy, it’s your fault.\nIf you’re a procrastinator, it’s your fault.\nWhat are you going to gain by escaping from the responsibility? Nothing. If\nyou want to change something about your life, you must fully know you’re\nresponsible for your actions. The things that you want to achieve can only\nbe achieved by yourself. Nobody else can do it for you. Complaining\nachieves nothing. It fills your mind with worry and negative thoughts.\nOverthinking and complaining all the time is terrible for your mental health.\n\f\nYou need to act. You can start today, or you can wait till tomorrow. The\nchoice is yours.\n\"The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second-best time is\nnow.\" -Chinese proverb\nMistakes aren’t as bad as you think\nIt’s okay that you made a mistake. When you’re doing something, mistakes\nare bound to happen. It’s normal. But you must take responsibility for your\nmistakes. You are responsible for all the actions that you do. Learn from\nyour mistakes and move on. Speed is necessary if you want to move\nforward with your life. You can’t sit there and keep thinking about your\nmistakes.\nIf you’re not a lazy person who sits all day and does nothing, then\nmistakes will happen. You can’t sit there, afraid of making mistakes; you\nmust jump into the unknown. \n“Success does not consist in never making mistakes but in never making the\nsame one a second time.”\n- George Bernard Shaw\nStick to your business\nThis simple tip will make you more productive: Don't worry if it’s not your\nbusiness. If something doesn’t affect you, don’t worry about it. People are\nconstantly worrying about things that don’t impact them. Keep yourself\nfocused on what is truly your concern. You’re the most important person in\nyour life, so make it your goal to do your best for yourself. Stop worrying\nabout other people's opinions. 99% of the opinions you hear are wrong and\nwill not help you. Trust in yourself.\n“Keep your attention focused entirely on what is truly your concern and be\nclear that what belongs to others is their business and none of yours.”-\nEpictetus\nNobody is coming to save you"

    "raw_text": "No one can change your life. Nobody has any interest in changing your life.\nTheir own life is a mess, so how can they change yours? You must do it\nyourself. It’s in your own hands. You can be lazy and wait for others to\nhelp, but you will wait forever. Get this out of your head that somebody else\ncan help you achieve your goals. Stop being dependent on other people.\nYou have the power to choose whether you want to remain lazy or want to\ndo something meaningful in life.\nHere’s a great fictional story of a farmer:\nOnce there was a farmer. He had a wheat farm. But there was a sparrow\nnest in his wheat farm, and there were four little children of that sparrow in\nthat nest. The Sparrow used to go daily in the forest to feed her little\nchildren. \nOne day, when she returned from the forest, she found their children\nwere terrified. She asked them what had happened and why they were so\nscared. They said the farmer had come here today and discussed wheat\nharvesting. He said he would send his sons to cut the crops tomorrow. They\nsaid where they will go after crops have been cut. After listening to their\nchildren, the sparrow said that nobody would come tomorrow to cut the\nwheat crops, so don't be scared.\nThe next day, the same happened, as Sparrow said. No one came there to\ncut the crops. Many days passed, but no one came there to cut the crops.\nEverything was going well. Sparrow's children were very happy.\nOne day, when Sparrow returned from the forest, she was again shocked\nby seeing her children's faces. They were so scared again. Sparrow asked\nthem the reason behind their fear. They again said the farmer had come here\ntoday and discussed crop harvesting. Today, he said he would send the\nlaborers to cut the crops tomorrow. After listening to them, Sparrow again\ntold them not to worry; no one would come tomorrow.\nThe next day, again, the same happened as Sparrow said. No one came there\nto cut the crops. Furthermore, many days passed. But no one came there to\ncut the crops.\n\f\nAgain, one day, the sparrow returned from the forest, and she saw her\nchildren's scared faces again. She asked again about their fear. They said the\nfarmer came here again today and talked about wheat harvesting. But today,\nhe said he has wasted a lot of time depending on others, and he said that\ntomorrow, he will come to cut the crops by himself. After listening to this,\nthe sparrow said, tomorrow, we will leave this place and make our nest in\nsome other place. Sparrow told their children that tomorrow he would cut\nthe wheat crops. That's why we must leave this place.\nThe next day, the same happened as the sparrow said. The farmer came\nthere and cut the crops. After seeing this, the sparrow's little children asked\nhis mother if whatever you said went right every time. What was the reason\nbehind this?\nSparrow said the farmer was dependent upon his sons the first time and\nthe second time he was dependent upon laborers. That's why the work was\nnot completed.\nBut the third time, he was not dependent upon anyone. That's why he\nsucceeded this time.\n3 Types of People:\nThere are three types of people I see all around me:\n1. The first one is the majority of people; they never start. They never do\nanything. They sit there and be lazy. They never work on their dreams.\nThey never do what they are supposed to do. They are just waiting for\nsomething good to happen.\n2. The second type of people are those who start, but as soon as things get\nhard, they give up, and then they regret why they gave up.\n3. The third type of people are those who work hard, don’t give up despite\nhardships, and keep going. They are the one percent who do become\nsuccessful.\n\f\nOne must be persistent. Things aren’t always smooth. Things can go\nwrong and will go wrong. Your path will have obstacles, but you must\nprogress toward your goals.\nLife is not a sprint but a marathon. It’s long and hard. There is no reward\nfor the quitters who quit halfway. You must reach the finish line to achieve\nsomething.\nControl What You Can Control\nYou must be aware of what you can and can’t control. Don’t become sad\nwhen things which you can’t control don’t work according to your plan.\nDon’t confuse what you can and can’t control. Not everything is out of your\ncontrol. There are a lot of things that you can control that will improve your\nlife. You have control over your mind. You have control over the amount of\nhard work you do. But you have no control over what other people will\nthink about you. Worrying about things you can’t control will make your\nlife miserable.\nOceanofPDF.com"

    "raw_text": "Comfort Zone Is Your Enemy\n“A comfort zone is a beautiful place, but nothing ever grows there.” -\nUnknown\nOne of the biggest reasons people are lazy and always want to do\neverything tomorrow is because they are too comfortable with their lives.\nThey don’t want to change the way things are going. Doing the things that\nyou’re always doing is easy, but it doesn’t lead to the growth that you want.\nGrowth demands that you step out of your comfort zone and do the hard\nthings. It’s easy to watch movies, read news, and scroll social media all day,\nbut it’s not meaningful, and you know it. Your body knows that you’re\nwasting your time. That’s why you feel bad after you waste your time that\ncould be used for something valuable and meaningful.\nDo you want to spend your entire life wasting your time? Time is running\nout. Soon, you will genuinely not have the energy to do what you want. Do\nthem now. Stop waiting for something to happen automatically. Nothing is\ngoing to happen; you must make it happen.\nAfter leaving their comfort zone, nobody says that they wish they stayed\nthere. You will feel blissful after you stop procrastinating and start doing\nwhat you want. Nothing gives you more happiness than waking up every\nday with the energy to start working on the things you want to do.\nKeep it Simple!\nWhenever you’re trying to do something new, always try to keep it as\nsimple as possible. Don’t try to do too much at one time. Don’t overthink\nabout all the things that can go wrong. Most of the time, they don’t go\nwrong at all. What you should do is to start as soon as possible. You need to\nhave urgency. The urge to do things fast. Not urgency in getting the desired\nresults but the urgency in doing the work. Let’s say you want to learn how\nto create a website. You can start right now, or you can keep waiting.\nYour first plan never works; you need to make adjustments. You may\neven need to change your plan altogether. Do it and do it as fast as possible.\n\f\nSpeed is crucial. You don’t have as much time as you think you have. Keep\nthings simple and do things with lightning speed.\n“Most decisions should probably be made with somewhere around 70\npercent of the information you wish you had…if you wait for 90 percent, in\nmost cases, you’re probably being slow.\"\n-Jeff Bezos\nStart to think a little bit differently!\n“If everyone is thinking alike, then somebody isn't thinking.” - George S.\nPatton\nYou do not need to think just like everyone else. You can judge for yourself.\nYou can think like no one else, and it is entirely okay.\nYou must think and do different things than anyone else to get different\nresults. You can’t do what everybody else is doing and expect different\nresults. You can’t do what you have been doing in the past and predict a\ndifferent outcome this time. Most of the time, the outcome is the same. If\nyou’re lazy, you know the result, just like the last time.\nSet Clear Goals\nWe should set clear goals that are both possible and can be achieved\nquickly. Setting huge, ambitious goals is not bad, but the problem is if\nyou're a super lazy person, you will not work toward that goal because it\nwould seem too hard and impossible to achieve. \nThat’s why in the start you should set small easy goals that can be achieved.\nGoals should also be clear. For example, a clear goal is that you want to\nlose 2 kilograms in 1 month. An unclear goal is that you want to be healthy.\nA goal that can’t be measured and has no time duration is not a goal.\nYou’re just expecting a miracle to happen.\nWrite down your goals\nIf you don’t write down your goals on paper, you should start doing it now;\nyou will not regret it. If you have clearly written goals and read them\nregularly, they will motivate you. You will feel some guilt if you don’t do\n\f\nwhat you have written. Even if you achieve half of your goals, that’s still\nbetter than doing nothing.\nDon’t Overcomplicate\nI’m not a big fan of all the various apps that people use to measure their\nproductivity. I think it’s a complete waste of time. You don’t need any app\nto focus on your goals. I prefer writing things. You only need two things:\npen and paper. That’s it. Don’t overcomplicate simple stuff.\nAnything more than that is just a waste of energy.\nYou Will Regret It Later\nWhen we don’t do what we actually want to do and instead procrastinate,\nthat thing keeps bothering us. It doesn’t allow us to live in peace because\nwe subconsciously know that we are lazy and should do that task, but we\ndon’t.\nThink Long Term\nYou can do two things. You can think long-term and do things that will be\nvaluable for you in the long term, or you can satisfy your short-term\npleasures and ignore the future.\nOne should have in mind how the actions that they take in the present are\ngoing to affect the future. One thing that I can tell you for sure is that you\nwill always regret being lazy. Laziness feels good in the present as it gives\nan immediate dopamine hit. Doing something new is hard and doesn’t give\nan instant dopamine hit, but in the future, you will always regret being lazy\nand never doing things that you want to do.\nYou need to delay instant gratification, do hard things, take some stress,\nand make sacrifices so that you can achieve your future goals.\nI’m not telling you not to avoid all fun in the present entirely, but\nsometimes short sacrifices are necessary for a better future.\nTake Risk\nDon’t be afraid of risks. If you want to achieve anything in your life, you\nmust jump from a comfortable position to an uncomfortable position. The\nregret of not taking a risk is enormous. You are going to regret your entire\n\f\nlife if you don’t take risks. Taking risks is scary and should be, but not\ntaking risks is even scarier,\n“The biggest risk is not taking any risk... In a world that is changing really\nquickly, the only strategy that is guaranteed to fail is not taking risks.”\n- Mark Zuckerberg\nNo Good, No Bad\nStop thinking everything is either good or bad. There are a lot of bad things\nthat happened to me, and I’m happy now that they happened to me as they\nchanged the trajectory of my life. Here’s a great story:\nThere was a farmer with a horse who helped him in farming. The villagers\nconstantly told the farmer how lucky he was to have such a great horse.\n“Maybe,” he would reply.\nOne day, the horse ran away. The villagers came to the farmer to express\ntheir sympathies.\n“That’s too bad.” the villagers said.\n“Maybe,” the farmer replied.\nA few days later, the horse returned home with ten strong wild horses.\n“That’s great, isn’t it?” the villagers said.\n“Maybe,” the farmer again replied.\nThe next day, the farmer’s son was riding one of the horses when it kicked\nhim off and broke his leg.\nThe villagers arrived to express their dismay.\n“That’s too bad,” they said.\n“Maybe,” the farmer replied.\nA military officer marched into the village the next day, recruiting able-\nbodied young men for the war. The farmer’s son, with his broken leg, was\n\f\nleft behind.\nThe villagers were joyful, “Your son has been spared. What beautiful luck!”\nThe farmer smiled.\n“Maybe.”\nOceanofPDF.com"

    "raw_text": "Self-Discipline\n“We must all suffer from one of two pains: the pain of discipline or the pain\nof regret.” – Jim Rohn\nSelf-discipline means doing the things that are good for your future but are\nhard to do in the present.\nGoing to the gym is hard, but sitting on the couch is easy.\nIt’s hard to start a business, but it's easy to procrastinate.\nIt’s hard to read books but easy to watch movies.    \nIt’s hard to wake up early but easy to lay in a warm bed.\nAll things that are going to improve your life are hard. Always ask\nyourself this question:\nWill I regret not doing this in the future?\nIf the answer is yes, it must be done no matter how hard it is.\nDo what needs to be done\n“There’s no shortage of remarkable ideas; what’s missing is the will to\nexecute them.” – Seth Godin\nDiscipline means doing anything that needs to be done. If this means\nworking hard, then you will work harder. If it means working smarter, then\nyou will be working smarter. Never avoid doing the things you want to do\njust because they’re hard.\nProcrastination is the enemy of discipline\n\f\nProcrastination means avoiding doing a task that needs to be done by giving\nexcuses to do it later. Without giving excuses, you will feel bad, and we\ndon’t want to feel bad, so we give different types of excuses. The most\npopular one is “I’m waiting for the right time.” The time will never be right;\nit can’t be perfect. There are always going to be obstacles in your way.\nMany things will try their best to make you lazy and procrastinate, but you\nmust overcome all of them.\nDelay Gratification\nIt’s hard to delay gratification because we want to enjoy things now.\nNothing is wrong with it, but the problem arises when you do things that\nharm your future. Actions that you will regret in the future, and you will be\nasking yourself why did I do that?\nYou must look in both directions: present and future. You must enjoy the\npresent but not at the cost of your future. By being lazy, you don’t enjoy\nboth your present and future.\nDo It Now!\n“Only put off until tomorrow what you are willing to die having left\nundone” - Pablo Picasso\nThe time is never going to be perfect. If it becomes perfect, then there is a\nchance that it’s already too late. You can wait all you want; nothing will\nhappen, or you can start today and move towards achieving your goals. You\ncan’t wait for the perfect time, better resources, or more experience. Even if\nyou don’t have a perfect plan with all the details, you can start today and\nfigure things out along the way.\nThere are no hacks\nStop looking for an easy way out. You can know all the tiny tips and hacks,\nbut you must do the work. A lot of people are just way too focused on\nlearning than doing. Learning is great but alone it will not be enough. You\n\f\nmust put in the work to get things done. Stop looking for hacks before you\neven begin. First, start and then learn about various methods to do things\nfaster. \nDon’t Let Failure Stop You\nThere are always ups and downs in life. Sometimes, you’re doing great;\nsometimes, you’re not. Here is a great story:\nOnce, a king called upon all of his wise men and asked them, is there a\nmantra or suggestion that works in every situation, circumstance, place, and\ntime? In every joy, every sorrow, every defeat, and every victory? One\nanswer for all questions\nAll the wise men were puzzled by the King's question. An old man\nsuggested something that appealed to all of them. They went to the king and\ngave him something written on paper, with the condition that the king\nwould not see it out of curiosity.\nOnly in extreme danger, when the King finds himself alone, and there\nseems to be no way, can he see it. The King put the papers under his\nDiamond ring.\nSometime later, the neighbors attacked the Kingdom. King and his army\nfought bravely but lost the battle. The King had to flee on his horse. The\nenemies were following him and getting closer and closer. Suddenly, the\nKing found himself standing at the end of the road - that road was not going\nanywhere. Underneath, there was a rocky valley a thousand feet deep. If he\njumped into it, he would be finished, and he could not return because it was\na small road, and the sound of enemy horses was approaching fast. The\nKing became restless. There seemed to be no way.\nThen suddenly he saw the Diamond in his ring shining in the sun and\nremembered the message hidden in the ring. He opened the diamond and\nread the message. The message was: THIS TOO SHALL PASS. \nThe King read it. Again, read it. Suddenly, something struck him- Yes! This\ntoo will pass. Only a few days ago, I was enjoying my kingdom. I was the\nmightiest of all the Kings. Yet today, the Kingdom and all my pleasures\nhave gone. I am here trying to escape from enemies. As those days of\n\f\nluxuries have gone, this day of danger too will pass. A calm came on his\nface. He kept standing there. The place where he was standing was full of\nnatural beauty. He had never known that such a beautiful place was also a\npart of his Kingdom.\nThe revelation of the message had a significant effect on him. He relaxed\nand forgot about those following him. After a few minutes, he realized that\nthe noise of the horses and the enemy coming was receding. They moved\ninto another part of the mountains and were nowhere near him.\nHe reorganized his army and fought again. He defeated the enemy and\nregained his empire. When he returned to his empire after victory, he was\nreceived with much fanfare. The whole capital was rejoicing in the victory.\nEveryone was in a festive mood. Flowers were being showered on King\nfrom every house, from every corner. People were dancing and singing. For\na moment, the King said, \" I am one of the bravest and greatest Kings.

It doesn’t mean you don’t give your 100%. It doesn’t mean that\nyou become lazy and don’t work hard.\nWhenever we start doing something new, the motivation is high, and we\nbegin with excitement as soon as the initial motivation wears off.

He was supported mainly financially by his\nyounger brother, Theo Van Gogh.

ACTION is the\ncure.”- Richie Norton\nI’m not saying perfection is terrible, but it’s not worth it in every part of\nyour life. Beautiful things exist because someone spends much time on tiny\ndetails. Without perfection, the world wouldn’t be that great. There would\nbe only low-quality things all around us. The world is beautiful both due to\nits perfection and imperfection.\nLeonardo da Vinci was obsessed with tiny details. He would spend years\ntrying to paint a single painting. When designing the Cathedral of Milan, he\ncreated hundreds of designs. It took him more than ten years to paint the\nfamous Mona Lisa.\nSteve Jobs also had a crazy obsession with details. When designing the\nfirst Macintosh computer, he insisted that the circuit board wires should\nlook straight and beautiful even though no one would see the inside as only\nthe technician could open the computer with special tools.\nIf you’re painting or creating something, then yes, it should be as perfect\nas possible, but if you’re doing something like cutting grass, which is going\nto regrow in a few weeks, don’t spend your entire day trying to be a\nperfectionist and trying to cut each blade of grass with perfection. \nYou should be able to turn on and off the switch of perfectionism.\nSometimes it’s needed, and sometimes it’s not. Don’t make a default setting\nof always being a perfectionist. Change it according to circumstances.\nDon’t hide your laziness with perfection. \nHere is an excellent quote by Shane Parish:\n\"If a decision is reversible, make it as soon as possible. If it is\nirreversible, make it as late as possible”.\n\f\nDone is better than perfect\nNot all things can be done perfectly. You can’t sit there and spend days on a\ntask that can be done in a few minutes.

It’s chosen over time through small\nchoices day by day.”\n–Todd Henry\nWe always have the choice of becoming great or becoming mediocre. To\nbecome great, it’s not an easy task. You have to give your very best each\nday. There will be failures. You will struggle a lot. To become mediocre,\nyou don’t have to do anything; your goal in life is never to be an average\nperson. You must give your best. Mediocre people never give their best they\nsettle down once things are a little bit okay, or they know that if they keep\ngoing things will become hard.\n99% of the people settle for less than they want. They settle for the jobs\nthey hate, and then they wonder why they aren’t productive, are not happy,\nlack motivation, and don’t wake up with the energy to do their job.\nHow can you wake up happy doing something you hate?\n“Your work will fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly\nsatisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do\ngreat work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking.\nDon’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it.”\n-Steve Jobs\nNobody wants to be mediocre. If you don’t believe it, ask someone, “Do\nyou want to become mediocre?”. You will get the answer. The answer is\nalways going to be no.\nThe one big reason people are mediocre is everyone around them is also\nmediocre. And if you try to become a little bit ambitious, people will tell\nyou all sorts of things to destroy your ambition. They don’t want to shine.\n\f\nMaybe they want you to, but if you aren’t mediocre, it will make them feel\nbad inside their heart, knowing they’re wasting their human potential.\nWhen we are children, we have all sorts of dreams and aspirations, and then\nsomething happens, and everybody falls in love with mediocrity.\nPeople have no sense of energy inside them to do something that time is\npassing by and they’re just dragging through life instead of living it.\nThink big.\nEven if you fail, that will still be better than the regret of never trying to\npush your boundaries. Imagine being an 80-year-old wishing you could\ntravel the world, pursue your dreams, and live how you want to, not how\nother people want to.\nYou still have time. At least for now, you have it, but one day, there will\nbe no time to do anything. Death will be standing at your door.\nLive your life always doing what you want to. You will need no\nproductivity tips; you will stop being lazy because a sense of purpose will\nbe inside you.\nIf you don’t like your work, change your work.\nIf you don’t like your friends, change your friends.\nIf you don’t like your thinking, change your thinking.\nIf you don’t like your life, change your life.\nRemember that a life of greatness is harder than life of mediocracy.

    "raw_text": "The Myth of Multitasking\n“The man who chases two rabbits catches neither.”\n- Confucius\nOn December 11, 1998, NASA launched the Mars Climate Orbiter to study\nthe climate of Mars. The Mars Climate Orbiter cost $125 million to build.\nOn September 23, 1999, the spacecraft entered orbit with Mars, and then\nsuddenly, NASA lost contact with it. It was due to a simple error: engineers\nfailed to convert from English units to metric. The spacecraft got too close\nto Mars, and it was destroyed.\nMultitasking means doing more than one thing at a time. It sounds good,\nbut it doesn’t work. We can’t focus on multiple important things at the same\ntime. If you have two important tasks, then multitasking will reduce your\nefficiency. You’re also more likely to tire quickly if you switch tasks\ncontinuously.\nAs the saying goes “The devil is in the details “You need to have complete\nfocus on whatever you’re doing at the moment. Switching tasks will reduce\nyour focus, and you’re more likely to make tiny mistakes that can have a\nhuge impact.  \nThe more you switch from one task to another, the faster you will get tired;\nwhen you’re tired, you’re less likely to pay attention to tiny details. The\nlevel of stress also rises as we change tasks.\n3 Tips That Will Make You More Productive:\n1)Avoid switching tasks. Work on one task with complete focus and then\nmove to another task.\n2)Remove all distractions you can from the work you’re doing. Be\ncompletely focused on the task at hand.\n\f\n3)Turn off all the non-important notifications on your phone.\nFocus\nThe best thing you can do to improve your productivity is to focus on one\ntask at a time. Important things aren’t meant to be done with low focus.\nThey demand our complete focus. Let’s say you need to do three things.\nThe best way is to do one with complete focus and then move to the second\nand third. The worst way is trying to do all the things at one time and\nswitching your task every five minutes to do another task. You might feel\nthat you’re productive, but you are not. Don’t allow anything to interrupt\nyour focus.\nTake a Nap\nWhen you work for an extended period with focus, your mind energy will\nget reduced. The best thing you can do is to take a nap. It may not be\npossible for everybody, but if you can do it, then it’s worth it; you will be\nmore energized to work with more focus. Don’t go for a long nap instead\nopt for shorter ones less than an hour. Avoid taking a nap after 3 pm. You\nmay find it difficult to sleep. Also, if you sleep too much during the day,\nyou may have trouble sleeping at night.\nNo Interruptions\nWe work best when we aren’t constantly disturbed by others. It takes some\ntime for our mind to get into a flow state to achieve maximum output, and if\nyou’re constantly distracted by things, you will not be able to focus\nproperly, and your productivity will suffer.\nMost Important Thing\nIf you must do multiple things first, you must know which one is important.\nYou must remove all the non-important tasks that will not help you achieve\n\f\nyour goals.\nIn everyone's life, there are a couple of things that you can stop doing, and\nit wouldn’t make any difference. The biggest distraction people face is that\ninstead of doing the important thing, they start doing the nonimportant\nthing.\nOceanofPDF.com"

    "raw_text": "Daily Routine\n“You'll never change your life until you change something you do daily. The\nsecret of your success is found in your daily routine.” - John C. Maxwell\nDeveloping a daily routine is super important. You must have some routine\nthat you would follow. Without a proper routine, you won’t be consistent\nwith your work. Some days, you would be motivated and work well; the\nrest of the days, you would lack motivation, and you’re going to\nprocrastinate. \nA daily routine would help you stay consistent. It will make you more\nfocused and will help you finish important tasks. Without routine, we prefer\ndoing the easy task, not the important one.\nWhat you do daily is going to shape your future. You are the sum of\neverything you’ve done for the past few years. To change who you are, you\nmust change what you do daily.\nA routine helps your mind to stop thinking all the time about what to do\nnext. You can adjust your routine to make it as perfect as possible. I suggest\nyou do it right now: look back at yesterday and see what can be improved.\nHere is the daily routine of Leo Tolstoy:\nLeo Tolstoy was born on 9 September 1828. When he was 18, he started\n“Journal of Daily Activities”. In this journal, he would write how much\ntime he would spend on any task like writing or studying, and then he\nwould later comment on how well he performed.\nHe would wake up each day at five o’clock. He would take a walk for an\nhour. He has a strict habit of writing each day. He also slept around 2 hours\nduring the day. He used to work in complete isolation. And would go to bed\nno later than 10 o’clock."

You must listen to yourself and don’t lie to\nyourself because you can make all sorts of excuses to justify your decision.\nThink for a moment and ask yourself what is the best time for me to\nwake up, which will make me more productive and help me achieve my\ngoals. Don’t say you must wake up late because you want to be\ncomfortable. You need to choose on behalf of your future self.\nMake the right choice, not the easy one.\nSit Alone\n“All of humanity's problems stem from our inability to sit quietly in a room\nalone” - Blaise Pascal\nYou must sit alone and think about what you are doing with your life,\nwhat things you’re doing are not improving your life, and instead, making\nyour life worse. Do this simple daily exercise for 5-10 minutes, and you\nwill have fantastic clarity about your life.\nEliminate All Distractions\nThe Trojan was between the Greeks and the City of Troy. It was a great\nbattle. It continued for ten years. But in the end, the Greeks won the war\nwith the famous Trojan Horse. They built a giant wooden horse that was\nhollow from the inside and left it outside the gates of Troy, and the whole\narmy of Greeks left. Trojans thought that they left the war and accepted\ndefeat. They pulled the horse inside the Walls of Troy. When the night fell,\nthe best warriors of the Greeks, who were hidden inside the Trojan Horse,\ngot out and opened the gates for their army, which now sailed back. Troy\nhas fallen.\n\f\nDistractions are like the Trojan Horse. They destroy your focus and\nproductivity. Be completely aware of hidden distractions. Distractions are\ncostly. Even if something distracted you for 2 minutes, 10 minutes are\nwasted because refocusing takes time.\nDelete Apps\nOn everyone's phones, a few apps distract them, are addicting, and you\nconstantly waste time on them. Delete them. Delete them all. If any app\ndistracts you, it should be deleted. For most, it would be video games. Once\nthey open the game, they waste 15 minutes before realizing it. Relaxation is\nnot bad. Everyone should relax as much as they like, but video games aren’t\nbuilt for relaxation. They consume much mental energy, so you’re even\nmore tired after playing. There are better ways to relax.\nDo this right now: open your phone and review all the apps and games\nyou waste your time on. Delete them. If you need them later, you can\nalways download them again. This simple thing will at least save you from\nwasting 30 minutes every day.\nOceanofPDF.com\n\f\nLearn To Say No\n“Half of the troubles of this life can be traced to saying yes too quickly and\nnot saying no soon enough.”\n-Josh Billings\nIf you want to take better control of your life and time, then you must learn\nhow to say no when you want to say no. We often say yes, even if we don’t\nwant to, just because we don’t want to make the other person sad. You\naccept everything other people want you to do, but you only have finite\nenergy and time. If you say yes to every opportunity, invite, and work\nyou’re asked to do, you will soon start to feel burdened by it. To appease\nothers, you will lose yourself in the process.\nSay no when you want to.\nSay yes when you want to.\nThis is the only way to take back charge of your time.\nYou don’t have to be rude to say no. You can say it very politely when you\nwant to. I also don’t say that you have to say no to everything. That’s also\nbad. You need to know when to say yes and when to say no.\n   Your time is valuable and if you keep doing what others want you to do\nthen you will be distracted from your main goal and, instead, start doing\nside things which will lower your productivity. If we keep listening to\nothers, then we will have no time to listen to ourselves.\n   We need to learn how to say no to opportunities that we have no interest\nin, and if we try to do everything, we will get nothing done. As the saying\ngoes, to be everywhere is to be nowhere.\n   If you’re saying yes to everything, then there is a chance that you’re not\nfocused on your goals, or you have no goals, which is even worse. If you\n\f\nhave no goals, you will get pushed by others according to their will here\nand there.\nHere is an excellent quote by Seneca:\n“If you don't know what port you sail to, no wind is favorable.”\nOceanofPDF.com\n\f\nDon't Work 24/7\n“20 years from now, the only people who will remember you worked late\nare your kids.”\n- Sahil Bloom\nThe goal of becoming more productive is not to work more, but it’s the\nopposite. The goal is to get your work done in less time so that you can\nspend time with your friends and family.  If you work too long, then both\nyour creativity and productivity suffer. It’s not worth it to spend 12 hours\nevery day in the office and neglect all other aspects of your life. Sometimes,\nit’s okay, but not all the time.\nWe should measure productivity by how much work we get done, not by\nhow much time we spend. Some people spend more time in the office to\nsatisfy their ego.\nIf you’re working a lot and still aren’t achieving your goals, there is a\nhigh chance that you’re avoiding the important things that need to be done\ninstead of doing things that aren’t that important. The less important things\nare distracting you from doing the actual important things. Doing less\nessential things instead of the most important thing is also procrastination.\nDon’t procrastinate on the essential things. They will bring most of the\nresults you want to achieve.\nI have seen that people do this deliberately; the essential things are hard\nto do, so instead of doing the hard work, they start doing easy things that\nmake them appear busy.\nLife is Short\nLife is very short. Don’t waste all your life working and then when you’re\nold wishing you did things differently."

You should work on things that move you toward your goals.\nDon’t start climbing a ladder and then halfway you look around and realise\nthat you’re climbing the wrong ladder. Work on your own dreams, not the\ndreams of others.\nBe productive, not busy. There is no reward for being busy all the time.\nDon’t be busy just for the sake of being busy. Be productive instead. Work\n\f\non things that move you towards your goals, not away.\nOceanofPDF.com\n\f\nDon’t Wait\n“Wisdom is knowing what to do next; Skill is knowing how to do it, and\nVirtue is doing it.” - David Starr Jordan\nThe one main reason that a lot of people are lazy is they’re always waiting\nfor the right time so that they can do something, and guess what? The right\ntime never happens. No time is good or bad. You can start today and make\nsome progress, or you can wait and console yourself that your time will\ncome.\nThrow away all the garbage that eventually your time will come without\nputting in the work. It won’t happen; you must do the work to achieve your\ngoals. I have seen zero successful people who just waited for the perfect\ntime.\nYes, some tasks can’t be done faster no matter how hard you try but that\ndoesn’t mean that you shouldn’t try at all and keep waiting.\nDon’t confuse your laziness with patience. Patience and laziness are very\ndifferent. Don’t mix them. You must put in the work every day, and then\nyou should be patient with the results.\nA Story of Great Patience\nA farmer once planted a bamboo tree. The farmer watered the crop daily for\na year but saw no sign of life. No growth, no sprouts, no hope. The second\nyear was the same as the third and fourth years. His patience and faith in\nthis “miracle” bamboo plant faded. During the fifth year, just as he was\nabout to give up on his dream of growing the plant, he noticed it sprout. The\nbamboo sprung up 60 feet over the next six weeks!\nThis is an excellent story of both patience and hard work. Life is just like\nthis. There is no overnight success. It takes a long time for success to\n\f\nhappen, but this also doesn’t mean sitting there and doing nothing. The crop\ndidn’t grow independently; the farmer had to plant it, take care of it, and be\npatient.\nImpatient With Action and Patient with Results\nA student of Zen went to his teacher and asked earnestly, “I am devoted to\nstudying Zen. How long will it take me to master it?”\n“Ten years,” the teacher said.\nImpatiently, the student answered, “But I want to master it faster than that. I\nwill work very hard. I will practice every day for ten or more hours if\nnecessary. How long will it take then?”\nThe teacher thought for a moment, “20 years.”\nYou have no control over the results you get or not get. You can only\ncontrol your actions and the work you do. Everyone wants to get results fast\nwhen they’re working hard, thinking they should be rewarded right now for\ntheir work, but generally, that doesn't happen. You may work hard for years\nbefore you get the results you want. You must be patient with the results,\nbut don’t be patient with action. Don’t be one of those people who think\neverything will be given to them automatically. You must do the work first\nbefore you get the results you want.\n\"A man who is a master of patience is master of everything else.\" - George\nSavile\nNo Perfect Time\nThere is nothing as perfect timing to start anything new. You can start today\nand make some progress, or you can keep waiting for the ideal time. The\nperfect time is now. There is no better time than today to start moving\ntoward your goals. Stop being lazy and start doing the work that is required."

You must learn to\nsay no.\nThis thing also goes the other way if you have friends who are not lazy,\ndon’t procrastinate, and have adopted good habits. You’ll become like them.\nThe choice is yours. The people you surround yourself will have a\nmassive impact on your life. They will shape your thoughts, actions, and\nyour life. The right people will improve your life, and the wrong ones will\nworsen your life.\nIf you’re always with a negative person, they will make you a negative\nperson but instead of you surround yourself with positive people you will\n\f\nbecome a positive person. You must think about whom you’re surrounding\nyourself with.\nChange Your Circle to Change Your Thinking\nIf you want to change your thoughts, you must change everything you do.\nYou must change the people you hang around with. If the people you spend\nthe most time with are lazy, negative, and in no way make your life even\nslightly better, then it would be worth it to change your circle or reduce\nlistening to their advice.\nSomeone said,\n\"Close the window that hurt you, no matter how beautiful the view is,\" and I\nfelt that!\nDon’t Take Advice from Everyone\nDon’t take advice on matters from someone you dislike exchanging places\nwith. Let’s say you want advice on how to be happier; the last person you\nwant to take this advice from is an unhappy person. Think about it: if his\nadvice has some value, then why would he be unhappy? Nobody loves to\nremain unhappy.\nWho you take advice from will decide the life you’re going to live.\nTake advice from unhappy people, and you will become\nunhappy.\nTake advice from unhealthy people, and you will become an\nunhealthy person.\nTake advice from angry people, and you will become angry.\n“If they don’t have what you want, don’t listen to what they say.” – Alex\nHormozi\n\f\nStop taking advice from people you don’t want to become. Stop listening to\nother people's opinions about how you should live your life and what you\nshould do. Their advice is completely useless.\nIt's your life; live the way you want to.\nOceanofPDF.com\n\f\nDon’t Worry\n“I am an old man and have known many troubles, most of which never\nhappened.”\n-Mark Twain\nWorrying loves a lazy person because a lazy person has nothing else to do\nexcept worry. Since they aren’t doing any work, all they can do is worry\nabout the future. If you believe in yourself, then there is no need to worry.\nWhen you don’t believe in yourself? The worry starts to appear. All types of\nnegative thoughts start to enter your mind. You start worrying about things\nwith a very low chance of happening.\nWorrying can only be destroyed by one thing, and that is through action.\nThat’s the only way I know to make your worries go away. I have no\nother knowledge. Let’s say you’re worried about your health, and then the\nonly thing you can do is to start taking care of your health. There is nothing\nelse you can do. Thinking about your health all day will not make you\nhealthier; it might do the opposite.\nWorrying is natural. We all worry about jobs, business, health, money,\nfamily, etc. You must classify your worries into two parts:\n1) The things that you can control, and you can do something about it.\n2) The things you can’t control, and you can’t do anything about them.\nWorrying about the first part is okay. You have to worry about your health\nso that you can take some action and improve it. This is what I call good\nworrying. It helps you do things that can make your life better.\nWorrying about the second part is stupid. Why worry about something\nyou can’t control? Let’s say tomorrow, an asteroid is coming to Earth and\n\f\ngoing to kill all of us. What’s the worry? You can’t do anything. Worrying\nabout things you can’t control is going to rob your happiness.\nMake a new rule to never worry about anything that you can’t control,\nand if you can control it, then act immediately and do something about it. In\nboth cases, there should be no worry.\nOceanofPDF.com"

    "raw_text": "Do the Hard Thing First\n“The cold water doesn't get warmer if you jump late.”\n-Unknown\nHere’s a simple tip to become more productive and feel better: the hardest\nwork you have for the entire day should be done first. No matter how hard\nit is, it needs to be done first. Whenever you start working, write all the\nthings that need to be done, pick the hardest and most complicated task, and\nimmediately start doing the task.\nAs humans, we don’t like to be uncomfortable; we don’t like to do hard\nthings if possible. So, we avoid it, but you can’t avoid doing a task. If you\ncan avoid doing a task, it wasn’t important in the first place. But if a task is\nimportant and needs to be done, the best thing you can do is to start\nworking on the task as soon as possible.\nThe hard task is also important and will help you achieve your goals. But\nsince it’s hard, you wouldn’t like to do it first, and then procrastination will\ntake over you, and you would delay it by saying, “I’m too tired” or “I don’t\nhave time now.” These are just excuses to avoid doing the work that needs\nto be done.\nHard Choices = Easy Life\nEveryone wants to live an easy life with no worries. A life where you don’t\nhave to do anything that you don’t want to do. A life in which there is\ncomplete freedom to do anything you want to. A life in which you don’t\nhave to worry about anything. Who doesn’t want to live like this?\nAn easy life for most people can only be possible by making hard\nchoices. There is no other way.  You have the option to choose one of the\nfollowing:\n\f\nEasy Choices = Hard Life\nHard Choices = Easy Life\nThis is the harsh truth of life. You have to make hard choices in the short\nterm to live an easy life in the long term. Being lazy is easy in the short run,\nbut it will make your life harder in the long run. Doing is hard; not doing is\neven harder. Going to the gym is hard, but not being healthy is even harder.\nThe choice is yours; you can make hard choices to live an easy life or\neasy choices to live a hard life.\nDo What You Need To\nThere is a very fine line between doing what you love and doing what you\nfind easy to do. We, as humans, love to do what is easy. We run away from\ndoing hard things. But once you start doing hard things, then it will get\neasier. The start is always the hardest. There is no reward in life for doing\nthe easy thing. In life, you will be rewarded for how hard things you can do.\nEverybody can do the easy thing. It’s the hard things that count. To get\nbetter results, start doing hard things.\nStop Living a Balance Life\nI’m not telling you to become crazy, but there is so much laziness in our life\nthat as soon as things get a little bit hard, we stop doing them by saying we\nwant to live a balanced life. You can balance a lot more than you think.\nBalance is required in life. You need to sleep a good amount of time\naccording to your body's needs. You need to spend as much time as you like\nwith your family and friends.\nTo live a balanced life, we have to remove all the hard things from life.\nWe don’t even like to do anything hard. We don’t want to make hard\n\f\nchoices. We don’t want to try new things. We just want to let things happen\nas they’re happening.\nA little bit of unbalance is required to achieve great things. I’m not in\nfavor of sacrificing anything for anything. I don’t suggest you sacrifice your\nhealth for money or anything else. All I’m saying is that you try to push a\nlittle bit of those imaginary walls that you have created in your mind.\nPushing them will not cost you anything. If you don’t feel good, you can\nalways move back but don’t sit there and never even try to push the wall a\nlittle bit.\nPicture Your Future Self\nWhenever you’re feeling lazy and don’t want to do the work, start thinking\nabout your future self.\nHow will you feel about not doing it in the future? How will you handle the\nregret?\nNow imagine how your life will look in the future if you do the hard work\ninstead of procrastinating.\nThere is no better way to motivate yourself than to think about your\nfuture self. Your future is always created by you in the present. The actions\nyou take will reflect how your future will look.\n“People do not decide their futures; they decide their habits, and their\nhabits decide their futures.”\n― F. M. Alexander\nOceanofPDF.com\n\f\nDelegate\nIf you want to do a few small things right, do them yourself. Learn\nto delegate if you want to do great things and make a big impact. -\nJohn C. Maxwell\nThere is no way to do everything by yourself. No matter what technique,\nhack, or tips you try, there will never be enough time to do everything by\nyourself, and that’s a good thing because we don’t need to do everything by\nourselves. Other people can help us do the things we don’t have time to do.\nIf you have any task that needs to be done and you have no time to do it,\nit’s a low-value task, which means that even if you don’t do it by yourself\nand instead hire someone              else, it will not make a difference.\nMany things take a lot of your time that aren’t that important, but you\ncan delegate right now so that you can use the time to do the things you\nwant to do.\nMake a list of all the non-important tasks you need to do every day, how\nmuch time it takes to do them, and how much money it will take for\nsomeone else to do them. You will see that you’re doing things that can be\neasily outsourced and very cheaply that take a lot of time daily. Try this for\na few things, and then see how it goes. Even if somebody else does around\n90% of a good job, it’s worth it. Also, there is a high chance that somebody\nelse will do a better job than us. We think that we can do a better job, but\nthat’s not true. It may appear to our mind that we can do better, but most of\nthe time, that’s not the case.\nOceanofPDF.com\n\f\nHow To Learn Anything Faster\n\"I constantly see people rise in life who are not the smartest, sometimes not\neven the most diligent, but they are learning machines.\" - Charlie Munger\nLearn What Is Useful\nDon’t learn anything just for the sake of learning it. Learn things that can\nimprove your life. Don’t become so weird with learning things that you\nstart learning local languages spoken in some villages in the nowhere.\nThink about what you’re learning, whether that is useful or not. If not, don’t\nspend time learning it. There are thousands of things that you can learn\ntoday that are helpful and will improve your life.\nNo Laziness While Learning\nYou can’t be lazy if you’re trying to learn something. You can’t just sit there\nand keep waiting to learn. You need to learn now. You need to start right\nnow. Let’s say you want to learn how to code. You can start learning right\nnow. There is no need to wait. Speed is crucial. I’m not saying to watch\nvideos at 3x, but you must have a sense of urgency. Learn at whatever pace\nyou’re comfortable with, but start it now. You will thank yourself later.\nSpeed Reading\n“If you can speed read it, it isn't worth reading.” – Naval Ravikant\nI’m not a huge fan of speed-reading books, as great books worth reading\ndemand your complete attention. The fastest way to read more books is to\nspend more time on books. That’s it. There are some books I spent weeks\nand some that I even read in a day. Don’t think too much about reading"

Kaizen\nIt means focusing on small improvements every day and not waiting for big\nimprovements but trying to become 1% better every day. Instead of setting\na big goal, we should divide it into multiple small goals and tackle each of\nthem one by one. \n3. Shoshin\nIt's a concept from Zen Buddhism that means approaching things with a\nbeginner's mindset.\n\f\n\"If your mind is empty ... It is open to everything. In the beginner's mind,\nthere are many possibilities, but in the expert's mind, there are few.\" -\nShunryu Suzuki (author of Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind)\n4. Hara Hachi Bu\nThis means to stop eating after you're 80% full. If you eat too much, you’re\nmore likely to feel lazy. This happens to people all the time. Once they eat\ntheir lunch, they start to feel tired because the body tries to digest all the\nfood they eat. So you start to feel sleepy, and you will not love to work instead you would like to\nprocrastinate.\n5. Shinrin-yoku\nShinin in Japanese means \"forest,\" and yoku means \"bath.”\nIt means that one should spend more time with nature. Spending time\nwith nature is the best way to deal with stress. Whenever you’re feeling\nstressed or overwhelmed, go for a walk. \n6. Wabi-sabi\nThis means that instead of perfection, one should find beauty in\nimperfection. Things can’t be perfect all the time. Some things can’t be\nperfect, and that’s okay. There is beauty even in perfection. Love the things\nthe way they are. Don’t be stubborn and try to change them. You will ruin\ntheir beauty.\n7.

Move your body every day, no matter\nwhether it’s physical work or some sort of exercise. Go for a run early in\nthe morning or when you feel overwhelmed during work go for a walk.\n2. You Are What You Eat\nWhat you eat will impact the way you feel during the day. If you feel\nlethargic, then maybe you need to change what you eat. It depends on\nperson to person, so look at your diet and see whether you can improve it.\n3. Have A Purpose\nIf you have no purpose, then you will never have the energy to do anything.\nIf you don’t love your work, then you will not be excited or filled with\nenergy. You need to have a sense of purpose to have constant motivation to\nwork hard. Find a purpose in your life.\n4. Drink More Water\nMake sure that you’re drinking plenty of water throughout the day.\n5. Surround Yourself with People You Love\n\f\nBe around with people you love and care about. People around whom you\nfeel happy and blissful. Stop being around negative people. Move away\nfrom all the toxic people in your life.\n6. Take Risks\nIf you’re not taking risks, then you will not have the motivation to do\nthings. Our mind needs constant challenges to keep it alert, and if you’re\ndoing the same task over and over, then your motivation will decrease.\n7. Don’t Overload Yourself\nStop having unrealistic expectations of yourself. You need to push yourself\nbut if you do it too much then it will have negative effects. Stop trying to do\ntoo many things in a day. You can’t do 20 things in a day.\n8. Not Multitasking\nMultitasking is a lie. It exhausts you fast and doesn’t allow you to focus on\na task. It acts as a distraction. Switching tasks reduce your productivity\ninstead of boosting it. Don’t multitask.\n9. Eliminating All Distractions\nThe best thing you can do is to eliminate all the distractions from your\nenvironment. Anything that diverts your brain's energy should be\neliminated.\n10. Having a Sense of Urgency\nYou can’t achieve anything in your life if you don’t have a sense of urgency.\nYou need to be patient with results and inpatient with action.

Don’t worry about other people's opinions. They didn’t live happily\n\f\nand want you to do the same. They’re filled with regrets and want you to\nhave the same kind of regrets.\nOnce, a father and a son were coming back from a village far away,\nwhere they had purchased a donkey. They overheard a man saying, see the\nfools, they have a donkey but still walking on feet. Both thought it was a\ngood idea, and they sat on the donkey.\nOn their way, another villager saw and spoke. Look, look at the poor\ndonkey. He can hardly walk. The man felt sorry for the donkey and got off.\nWhile crossing the fields, a woman remarked. The son is young and\nhealthy; he should walk and let his father sit on the donkey. Son told his\nfather, “I am sorry, Dad, please come sit on the donkey,” so they changed\nplaces.\nAs they were about to reach their village, a passerby said, \"Hey, see the\nselfish man; the poor son is walking and enjoying the ride. Without giving\nanother thought, both tied the donkey upside down to a long bamboo and\ncarried him through the village.\nBy the time they reached home, all were laughing at them. A villager\nelder asked, why are you carrying this donkey like this? Can’t walk?\nFather explained what happened on the way. The old man said everyone\nwas laughing at you because instead of using your senses, you kept on\ndoing what others said.\nOne day just like this book your life will end. Do the things you want to\ndo. Travel the places you want to. Read the books you want to. Surround\nyourself with the people you want to.\nTime is running out.
