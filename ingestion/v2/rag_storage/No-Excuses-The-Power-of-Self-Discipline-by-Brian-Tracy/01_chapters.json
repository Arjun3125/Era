    "raw_text": "Introduction: The Miracle of Self-Discipline\n \n“There are a thousand excuses for failure but never a good reason.”\n—MARK TWAIN\n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhy are some people more successful than others? Why do some people\nmake more money, live happier lives, and accomplish much more in the\nsame number of years than the great majority? What is the real “secret of\nsuccess?”\n \nOften I begin a seminar with a little exercise. I ask the audience, “How\nmany people here would like to double their income?”\n \nAlmost everyone smiles and raises their hands. I then ask, “How many\npeople here would like to lose weight? Get out of debt? Achieve financial\nindependence?”\n \nAgain, everyone smiles, some people cheer, and they all raise their hands.\nThen I say, “Wonderful! These are great goals that everyone has. We all\nwant to make more money, spend more time with our families, be fit and\ntrim, and achieve financial independence.\n \n“Not only do we all want the same things, but we all know what we have\nto do to achieve them. And we all intend to do those things, sometime. But"

    "raw_text": "before we get started, we decide that we need to take a little vacation to a\nwonderful fantasy place called ‘Someday Isle.’\n \n“We say that ‘Someday I’ll read that book. Someday I’ll start that\nexercise program. Someday I’ll upgrade my skills and earn more money.\nSomeday I’ll get my finances under control and get out of debt. Someday\nI’ll do all those things that I know I need to do to achieve all my goals.\nSomeday.’”\n \nProbably 80 percent of the population lives on Someday Isle most of the\ntime. They think and dream and fantasize about all the things they are going\nto do “someday.”\n \nAnd who are they surrounded by on Someday Isle? Other people on\nSomeday Isle! And what is the chief topic of conversation on Someday\nIsle? Excuses! They all sit around and swap excuses for being on the island.\n \n“Why are you here?” they ask each other.\n \nNot surprising, their excuses are largely the same: “I didn’t have a happy\nchildhood,” “I didn’t get a good education,” “I don’t have any money,” “My\nboss is really critical,” “My marriage is no good,” “No one appreciates me,”\nor “The economy is terrible.”\n \nThey have come down with the disease of “excusitis,” which is\ninvariable fatal to success. They all have good intentions, but as everyone\nknows, “The road to hell is paved with good intentions.”\n \nThe first rule of success is simple: Vote yourself off the island!\n\f\nNo more excuses! Do it or don’t do it—but don’t make excuses. Stop\nusing your incredible brain to think up elaborate rationalizations and\njustifications for not taking action. Do something. Do anything. Get on with\nit! Repeat to yourself: “If it’s to be, it’s up to me!”\n \nLosers make excuses; winners make progress. Now, how can you tell if\nyour favorite excuse is valid or not? It’s simple. Look around and ask, “Is\nthere anyone else who has my same excuse who is successful anyway?”\n \nWhen you ask this question, if you are honest, you will have to admit that\nthere are thousands and even millions of people who have had it far worse\nthan you have who have gone on to do wonderful things with their lives.\nAnd what thousands and millions of others have done, you can do as well—\nif you try.\n \nIt has been said that if people put as much energy into achieving their\ngoals as they spend making up excuses for failure, they would actually\nsurprise themselves. But first, you have to vote yourself off the island."

    "raw_text": "Humble Beginnings\n \nVery few people start off with many advantages. Personally, I did not\ngraduate from high school. I worked at laboring jobs for several years. I had\nlimited education, limited skills, and a limited future. And then I began\nasking that question: “Why are some people more successful than others?”\nThis question changed my life.\n \nOver the years, I have read thousands of books and articles on the\nsubjects of success and achievement. It seems that the reasons for these\naccomplishments have been discussed and written about for more than\n2,000 years, in every conceivable way.\n \nOne quality that most philosophers, teachers, and experts agree on is the\nimportance of self-discipline. Discipline is what you must have to resist the\nlure of excuses.\n \nIt is self-discipline that enables you to “vote yourself off the island.” It is\nthe key to a great life and, without it, no lasting success is possible.\n \nThe development of self-discipline changed my life, and it will change\nyours as well. By continually demanding more from myself, I became\nsuccessful in sales and then in management. I caught up on my schooling\nand took an MBA degree in my thirties, which required thousands of hours\nof determined study. I imported Suzuki vehicles into Canada before anyone\nelse, set up sixty-five dealerships, and sold $25 million worth of the\nvehicles, and this is all after I had started with no knowledge of the\nindustry. What I had, however, was the discipline and determination to learn\nwhat I needed to know and then apply what I needed to do.\n\f\nI got into real estate development with no knowledge or experience,\napplied the power of discipline, which was then backed by hundreds of\nhours of work and study. I then went on to build shopping centers, industrial\nparks, office buildings, and residential subdivisions.\n \nWith self-discipline, I have built successful businesses in training,\nconsulting, speaking, writing, recording, and distribution. My audio and\nvideo programs, books, seminars, and training programs have sold more\nthan $500 million in thirty-six languages and fifty-four countries. Over the\nyears I have consulted for more than 1,000 companies and trained more\nthan 5 million people in live seminars and talks. In every case, the practice\nof self-discipline has been essential to my success.\n \nI discovered that you can achieve almost any goal you set for yourself if\nyou have the discipline to pay the price, to do what you need to do, and to\nnever give up."

    "raw_text": "Who Should Read This Book?\n \nThis book is written for ambitious, determined men and women who want\nto achieve everything that is possible for them in life. It is written for people\nwho are “hungry” to do more, to have more, and to be more than they ever\nhave been before.\n \nPerhaps the most important insight of all with regard to success is that to\nachieve greatly, you must become a different person. It is not the material\nthings you accomplish or acquire that matter so much as it is the quality of\nthe person you must become to accomplish well above the average. The\ndevelopment of self-discipline is the high road that makes everything\npossible for you.\n \nThis book will serve as your step-by-step guide to becoming a\nremarkable person who is capable of remarkable achievements.\n\f\nA Chance Encounter Reveals the Reason for Success\n \nSome years ago, I was attending a conference in Washington, D.C. During\nthe lunch break I was eating at a nearby Food Fair. The area was crowded,\nso I sat down at the last open table by myself, even though it was a table for\nfour.\n \nA few minutes later, an older gentlemen and a younger woman who\nappeared to be his assistant came along, carrying trays of food and\nobviously looking for a place to sit.\n \nHaving lots of room at my table, I immediately arose and invited the\nolder gentlemen to join me. He was hesitant, but I insisted. Finally, he sat\ndown, quite thankfully, and we began to chat over lunch.\n \nIt turned out that his name was Kop Kopmeyer. As it happened, I\nimmediately knew who he was. He was a legend in the field of success and\nachievement. Kop Kopmeyer had written four bestselling books, each of\nwhich contained 250 success principles that he had derived from more than\nfifty years of research and study. I had read all four books from cover to\ncover, each more than once.\n \nAfter we had chatted for a while, I asked him the question that many\npeople in this situation would ask: “Of all the 1,000 success principles that\nyou have discovered, which do you think is the most important?”\n \nHe smiled at me with a twinkle in his eye, as if he had been asked this\nquestion many times, and he replied without hesitating, “The most\n\f\nimportant success principle of all was stated by Elbert Hubbard, one of the\nmost prolific writers in American history, at the beginning of the twentieth\ncentury. He said, ‘Self-discipline is the ability to do what you should do,\nwhen you should do it, whether you feel like it or not.’”\n \nHe went on to say, “There are 999 other success principles that I have\nfound in my reading and experience, but without self-discipline, none of\nthem work. With self-discipline, they all work.”\n \nThus, self-discipline is the key to personal greatness. It is the magic\nquality that opens all doors for you and makes everything else possible.\nWith self-discipline, the average person can rise as far and as fast as his\ntalents and intelligence can take him. But without self-discipline, a person\nwith every blessing of background, education, and opportunity will seldom\nrise above mediocrity."

    "raw_text": "Your Two Worst Enemies\n \nJust as self-discipline is the key to success, the lack of self-discipline is the\nmajor cause of failure, frustration, underachievement, and unhappiness in\nlife. It causes us to make excuses and sell ourselves short.\n \nPerhaps the two biggest enemies of success, happiness and personal\nfulfillment, are first the Path of Least Resistance and, second, the\nExpediency Factor.\n \nThe Path of Least Resistance is what causes people to take the easy way\nin almost every situation. They seek shortcuts to everything. They arrive at\nwork at the last minute and leave at the first opportunity. They look for get-\nrich-quick schemes and easy money. Over time, they develop the habit of\nalways seeking an easier, faster way to get the things they want rather than\ndoing what is hard but necessary to achieve real success.\n \nThe Expediency Factor, which is an extension of the law of least\nresistance, is even worse when leading people to failure and\nunderachievement. This principle says, “People invariably seek the fastest\nand easiest way to get the things they want, right now, with little or no\nconcern for the long-term consequences of their behaviors.” In other words,\nmost people do what is expedient, what is fun and easy rather than what is\nnecessary for success.\n \nEvery day, and every minute of every day, there is a battle going on\ninside of you between doing what is right, hard, and necessary (like the\nangel on one shoulder) or doing what is fun, easy, and of little or no value\n(like the devil on your other shoulder). Every minute of every day, you must\n\f\nfight and win this battle with the Expediency Factor and resist the pull of\nthe Path of Least Resistance if you truly desire to become everything you\nare capable of becoming.\n\f\nTake Control of Yourself\n \nAnother definition of self-discipline is self-mastery. Success is possible\nonly when you can master your own emotions, appetites, and inclinations.\nPeople who lack the ability to master their appetites become weak and\ndissolute, as well as unreliable in other things as well.\n \nSelf-discipline can also be defined as self-control. Your ability to control\nyourself and your actions, control what you say and do, and ensure that\nyour behaviors are consistent with your long-term goals and objectives is\nthe mark of the superior person.\n \nDiscipline has been defined as self-denial. This requires that you deny\nyourself the easy pleasures, the temptations that lead so many people astray,\nand instead discipline yourself to do only those things that you know are\nright for the long term and appropriate for the moment.\n \nSelf-discipline requires delayed gratification, the ability to put off\nsatisfaction in the short term in order to enjoy greater rewards in the long\nterm.\n\f\nThink Long Term\n \nSociologist Dr. Edward Banfield of Harvard University conducted a fifty-\nyear study into the reasons for upward socioeconomic mobility in America.\nHe concluded that the most important single attribute of people who\nachieved great success in life was “long time perspective.” Banfield defined\n“time perspective” as “the amount of time an individual takes into\nconsideration when determining his present actions.”\n \nIn other words, the most successful people are long-term thinkers. They\nlook into the future as far as they can to determine the kind of people they\nwant to become and the goals they want to achieve. They then come back to\nthe present and determine the things that they will have to do—or not do—\nto achieve their desired futures.\n \nThis practice of long-term thinking applies to work, career, marriage,\nrelationships, money, and personal conduct—each of which is covered in\nthe pages ahead. Successful people make sure that everything they do in the\nshort term is consistent with where they want to end up in the long term.\nThey practice self-discipline at all times.\n \nPerhaps the most important word in long-term thinking is sacrifice.\nSuperior people have the ability to throughout their lives make sacrifices in\nthe short term, both large and small, so as to assure greater results and\nrewards in the long term.\n \nYou see this willingness to sacrifice in people who spend many hours and\neven years preparing, studying, and upgrading their skills to make\nthemselves more valuable so that they can have a better life in the future,\n\f\nrather than spending most of their time socializing and having fun in the\npresent.\n \nLongfellow once wrote:\n“Those heights by great men, won and kept, \nWere not achieved by sudden flight. \nBut they, while their companions slept, \nWere toiling upward in the night.”\n   \nYour ability to think, plan, and work hard in the short term and to\ndiscipline yourself to do what is right and necessary before you do what is\nfun and easy is the key to creating a wonderful future for yourself.\n \nYour ability to think long term is a developed skill. As you get better at it,\nyou become more able to predict with increasing accuracy what is likely to\nhappen to you in the future as the result of your actions in the present. This\nis a quality of the superior thinker.\n\f\nShort-Term Gain Can Cause Long-Term Pain\n \nThere are two laws that you fall victim to when you fail to practice self-\ndiscipline. The first is called the “Law of Unintended Consequences.” This\nlaw states that “the unintended consequences of an action can be far worse\nthan the intended consequences of that behavior because of a lack of long-\nterm thinking.”\n \nThe second is the “Law of Perverse Consequences,” which says that “a\nshort-term action aimed at immediate gratification can lead to perverse, or\nthe opposite, consequences from those at which it was aimed.”\n \nFor example, you might make an investment of time, money, or emotion\nwith the desire and intent to be better off and happier as a result. But\nbecause you acted without carefully thinking or doing your homework, the\nconsequences of your behavior turned out to be far worse than if you had\ndone nothing at all. Every person has had this experience, and usually more\nthan once."

    "raw_text": "The Common Denominator of Success\n \nHerbert Grey, a businessman, conducted a long-term study searching for\nwhat he called “the common denominator of success.” After eleven years,\nhe finally concluded that the common denominator of success was that\n“successful people make a habit of doing the things that unsuccessful\npeople don’t like to do.”\n \nAnd what were these things? It turned out that the things that successful\npeople don’t like to do are the same things that failures don’t like to do\neither. But successful people do them anyway because they know that this is\nthe price they have to pay if they want to enjoy greater success and rewards\nin the future.\n \nWhat Grey found was that successful people are more concerned with\n“pleasing results,” whereas failures were more concerned about “pleasing\nmethods.” Successful, happy people were more concerned with the positive,\nlong-term consequences of their behaviors, whereas unsuccessful people\nwere more concerned with personal enjoyment and immediate\ngratification.\n \nMotivational speaker Denis Waitley has said that the top people were\nthose who were more concerned with activities that were “goal achieving,”\nwhereas average people were more concerned with activities that were\n“tension relieving.”\n\f\nDinner Before Dessert\n \nThe simplest rule in the practice of self-discipline is to eat “dinner before\ndessert.” In a meal, there is a logical order of dishes, and dessert comes last.\nFirst, you eat the main courses and clean your plate; only then do you have\ndessert.\n \nThere is a cute but misleading bumper sticker that says, “Life is short; eat\ndessert first.”\n \nJust think what would happen if you came home after work and, instead\nof eating a healthy dinner, you ate a large piece of apple pie with ice cream.\nWhat kind of appetite for healthy, nutritious food would you have\nafterward? With all that sugar in your stomach, how would you feel? Would\nyou feel re-energized and eager to do something productive? Or would you\nfeel tired and sluggish and ready to write off the day as largely finished?\n \nYou get the same result when you go for a drink or two after work and\nthen come home and turn on the television. These are simply different\nforms of “dessert” that largely eliminate your ability to do anything useful\nfor the rest of the evening.\n \nPerhaps the worst part of all is that, whatever you do repeatedly soon\nbecomes a habit. And a habit, once formed, is hard to break. The habit of\ntaking the easy way, doing what is fun and enjoyable, or eating dessert\nbefore dinner becomes stronger and stronger, and it leads inevitably to\npersonal weakness, underachievement, and failure.\n\f\nThe Habit of Self-Discipline\n \nFortunately, you can develop the habit of self-discipline. The regular\npractice of disciplining yourself to do what you should do, when you should\ndo it, whether you feel like it or not becomes stronger and stronger as you\npractice it. You refuse to make excuses.\n \nBad habits are easy to form, but hard to live with. Good habits are hard to\nform, but easy to live with. And as Goethe said, “Everything is hard before\nit’s easy.”\n \nIt is hard to form the habits of self-discipline, self-mastery, and self-\ncontrol, but once you have developed them, they become automatic and\neasy to practice. When the habits of self-discipline are firmly entrenched in\nyour behavior, you start to feel uncomfortable when you are not behaving in\na self-disciplined manner.\n \nThe best news is that all habits are learnable. You can learn any habit\nyou need to learn in order to become the kind of person that you want to\nbecome. You can become an excellent person by practicing self-discipline\nwhenever it is called for.\n \nEvery practice of self-discipline strengthens every other discipline.\nUnfortunately, every weakness in discipline weakens your other disciplines\nas well.\n \nTo develop the habit of self-discipline, you first make a firm decision\nabout how you will behave in a particular area of activity. You then refuse\n\f\nto allow exceptions until the habit of self-discipline in that area is firmly\nestablished. Each time you slip, as you will, you resolve once again to keep\npracticing self-discipline until it becomes easier for you to behave in a\ndisciplined way than to behave in an undisciplined way.\n\f\nThe Big Payoff\n \nThe payoff for developing high levels of self-discipline is extraordinary!\nThere is a direct relationship between self-discipline and self-esteem:\n• The more you practice self-mastery and self-control, the more\nyou like and value yourself;\n• The more you discipline yourself, the greater is your sense of\nself-respect and personal pride;\n• The more you practice self-discipline, the better is your self-\nimage. You see yourself and think about yourself in a more positive\nway. You feel happier and more powerful as a person.\n \nThe development and maintenance of the habit of self-discipline are a\nlifelong task, an ongoing battle. It never ends. The temptation to follow the\npath of least resistance and the expediency factor lurk continually in the\nback of your mind. They are always waiting for an opportunity to pounce,\nto lead you astray into doing what is fun, easy, and unimportant rather than\nwhat is hard, necessary, and life-enhancing.\n \nNapoleon Hill concluded his bestselling book of the same name by\nsaying that “Self-discipline is the master key to riches.” Self-discipline is\nthe key to self-esteem, self-respect, and personal pride. The development of\nself-discipline is your guarantee that you will eventually overcome all your\nobstacles and create a wonderful life for yourself.\n \nThe ability to practice self-discipline is the real reason why some people\nare more successful and happy than others."

    "raw_text": "Chapter 1\n \nSelf-Discipline and Success\n \n“The first and best victory is to conquer self.”\n—PLATO\n \n \n \n \nWhy do some people accomplish so much more in their personal and\nprofessional lives than others? This question has occupied some of the very\nbest minds throughout human history. More than 2,300 years ago, Aristotle\nwrote that the ultimate aim of human life is to be happy. He said that the\ngreat question that each of us must answer is, “How shall we live in order\nto be happy?”\n \nYour ability to ask and answer that question correctly for yourself—and\nthen to follow where your answer leads you—will largely determine\nwhether you achieve your own happiness, and how soon.\n \nBegin with your own personal definition. How do you define success? If\nyou could wave a magic wand and make your life perfect in every way,\nwhat would it look like?\n\f\nDescribe Your Ideal Life\n \nIf your business, work, and career were ideal in every way, what would\nthey look like? What would you be doing? What sort of company would\nyou work for? What position would you have? How much money would\nyou earn? What kind of people would you work with? And, especially, what\nwould you need to do more or less of to create your perfect career?\n \nIf your family life were perfect in every way, what would it look like?\nWhere would you live, and how would you be living? What kind of a\nlifestyle would you have? What sort of things would you want to have and\ndo with the members of your family? If you had no limitations and you\ncould wave a magic wand, in what ways would you change your family life\ntoday?\n \nIf your health were perfect, how would you describe it? How would you\nfeel? How much would you weigh? How would your levels of health and\nfitness be different from what they are today? Most of all, what steps could\nyou take immediately to begin moving toward your ideal levels of health\nand energy?\n \nIf your financial situation were ideal, how much would you have in the\nbank? How much would you be earning each month and each year from\nyour investments? If you had enough money that you never had to worry\nabout finances again, how much would that be? What steps could you take,\nstarting today, to create your ideal financial life?\n\f\nDo Your Own Thing\n \nA popular definition of success is “being able to live your life in your own\nway, doing only those things that you want to do, with the people who you\nchoose, in the situations you desire.”\n \nIn each case, when you begin to define what “success” means to you, you\ncan immediately see things that you should be doing more of or less of in\norder to begin creating your ideal life. And the biggest thing that holds you\nback from moving in the direction of your dreams is usually your favorite\nexcuses and a lack of self-discipline.\n \nIt’s not that you don’t know what to do, but rather that you don’t have the\ndiscipline to make yourself do what you should do, whether you feel like it\nor not."

    "raw_text": "Join the Top 20 Percent\n \nIn our society, the top 20 percent of people earn 80 percent of the money\nand enjoy 80 percent of the riches and rewards. This “Pareto Principle” has\nbeen proven over and over again since it was first formulated in 1895 by\nVilfredo Pareto. Your first goal in your career should be to get into the top\n20 percent in your chosen field.\n \nIn the twenty-first century, there is a premium on knowledge and skill.\nThe more knowledge you acquire and the greater skill that you apply, the\nmore competent and valuable you become. As you get better at what you\ndo, your income-earning ability increases—like compound interest.\n \nUnfortunately, the majority of people—the bottom 80 percent—make\nlittle or no effort to upgrade their skills. Most people, according to Geoffrey\nColvin’s 2009 book Talent Is Overrated, learn their jobs in the first year of\ntheir employment, and then they never get any better. It is only the top\npeople in every field who are committed to continuous improvement.\n \nBecause of this increasing disparity of productive ability, based on\nknowledge, skill, and hard work, the top 1 percent of people in American\ntoday control as much as 33 percent of the financial assets.\n\f\nStarting with Nothing\n \nInterestingly, almost everyone starts out the same in life—with little or\nnothing. Almost all fortunes in America (and worldwide) are first\ngeneration. This means that most individuals started with little or nothing\nand earned everything they own in their current lifetime.\n \nThe wealthiest people in America are almost all first-generation\nmultibillionaires. This is the case with wealthy Americans such as Bill\nGates, Warren Buffett, Larry Ellison, Michael Dell, and Paul Allen. Fully\n80 percent of millionaires and multimillionaires started with little money,\noften penniless, and sometimes deeply in debt and with few advantages,\nsuch as Sam Walton, who died worth more than $100 billion. Why have\nthese people been able to achieve so much when so many have achieved so\nlittle?\n \nIn their book, The Millionaire Next Door, Thomas Stanley and William\nDanko interviewed more than 500 millionaires and surveyed 11,000 more\nover a twenty-five-year period. They asked them why they felt they had\nbeen able to achieve financial independence when most of the people\naround them, who started at the same place, were still struggling. Fully 85\npercent of this new generation of millionaires replied by saying something\nlike “I didn’t have a better education or more intelligence, but I was willing\nto work harder than anyone else.”\n\f\nHard Work Is the Key\n \nThe indispensable requirement for hard work is self-discipline. Success is\npossible only when you can overcome the natural tendency to cut corners\nand take the easy way. Lasting success is possible only when you can\ndiscipline yourself to work hard for a long, long time.\n \nAs I mentioned in the Introduction, I started my own life with no money\nor advantages. For years, I worked at laboring jobs, at which I earned just\nenough to get from paycheck to paycheck. I stumbled into sales when I\ncould no longer find a laboring job, where I spun my wheels for many\nmonths before I began asking that question: “Why is it that some people are\nmore successful in selling than others?”\n \nOne day, a top salesman then told me that the top 20 percent of\nsalespeople earn 80 percent of the money. I had never heard that before.\nThis meant that the bottom 80 percent of salespeople had to be satisfied\nwith the remaining 20 percent, with what was left over after the top people\nhad taken the lion’s share. I decided then and there that I was going to be in\nthe top 20 percent. This decision changed my life."

    "raw_text": "The Great Law\n \nThen I learned the “Iron Law of the Universe,” which made getting into the\ntop 20 percent possible. It was the Law of Cause and Effect, or sowing and\nreaping. This law says that “for every effect, there is a specific cause or\nseries of causes.”\n \nThis law says that if you want to achieve success in any area, you must\ndetermine how success is achieved in that area and then practice those skills\nand activities repeatedly until you achieve the same results.\n \nHere’s the rule: “If you do what other successful people do, over and\nover again, nothing can stop you from eventually enjoying the same\nrewards that they do. But if you don’t do what successful people do,\nnothing can help you.”\n \nThe law of sowing and reaping, from the Old Testament, is a variation of\nThe Law of Cause and Effect. It says that “whatsoever a man soweth, that\nalso shall he reap.” This law says that whatever you put in, you get out. It\nalso says that whatever you are reaping today is a result of what you have\nsown in the past. So if you are not happy with your current “crop,” it is up\nto you, starting today, to plant a new crop, to begin doing more of those\nthings that lead to success—and to stop engaging in those activities that\nlead nowhere.\n\f\nSuccess Is Predictable\n \nSuccess is not an accident. Sadly, failure is not an accident either. You\nsucceed when you do what other successful people do, over and over, until\nthese behaviors become a habit. Likewise, you fail if you don’t do what\nsuccessful people do. In either case, nature is neutral. Nature does not take\nsides. Nature doesn’t care. What happens to you is simply a matter of law—\nthe law of cause and effect.\n \nYou can look at yourself as a machine with a default mechanism. Your\ndefault mechanism is the almost irresistible attraction of the expediency\nfactor and the path of least resistance that I described in the Introduction. In\nthe absence of self-discipline, your default mechanism goes off\nautomatically. This is the main cause of underachievement and the failure to\nrealize your true potential.\n \nWhen you are not working deliberately, consciously, and continuously to\ndo, be, and have those things that constitute success for you, your default\nmechanism is at work. You end up doing those fun, easy, and low-value\nthings in the short term that lead to frustration, financial worries, and failure\nin the long term.\n\f\nThe Secrets of Success\n \nThe great oil man, H. L. Hunt, who was at one time the richest self-made\nbillionaire in the world, was once asked by a television journalist for his\n“secrets of success.” He replied: “There are only three requirements for\nsuccess. First, decide exactly what it is you want in life. Second, determine\nthe price that you are going to have to pay to get the things you want. And\nthird, and this is most important, resolve to pay that price.”\n \nOne of the most important requirements for success, once you have\ndecided what it is that you want, is the quality of willingness. Successful\npeople are willing to pay the price, whatever it is and for as long as it takes,\nuntil they achieve the results they desire.\n \nEveryone wants to be successful. Everyone wants to be healthy, happy,\nthin, and rich. But most people are not willing to pay the price.\nOccasionally, they may be willing to pay part of the price, but they are not\nwilling to pay the whole price. They always hold back. They always have\nsome excuse or rationalization for not disciplining themselves to do\neverything that they need to do to achieve their goals."

    "raw_text": "Pay the Price\n \nHow can you tell when you have paid the full price of success? It’s simple:\nLook around you. There it is! You can always tell how much of the price of\nsuccess you have paid by looking at your current lifestyle and your bank\naccount. By the Law of Correspondence, your outer world will, like a\nmirror, always reflect the person you are and the price you have paid on the\ninside.\n \nThere is an interesting point about the price of success: It must always be\npaid in full—and in advance. Success, however you define it, is not like a\nrestaurant where you pay after you have enjoyed your meal. Instead it is\nlike a cafeteria, where you can choose whatever you want, but you must pay\nfor it before you eat it.\n \nMotivational speaker Zig Ziglar says, “The elevator to success is out of\norder, but the stairs are always open.”\n\f\nLearn from the Experts\n \nKop Kopmeyer, who I mentioned in the Introduction, also told me that the\nsecond most important success principle, after self-discipline, is that you\nmust “learn from the experts. You will never live long enough to learn it all\nfor yourself.”\n \nIf you want to be successful, your first job is to learn what you need to\nlearn in order to achieve the success you desire. Learn from the experts.\nRead their books. Listen to their audio programs. Attend their seminars.\nWrite to them or approach them directly and ask them for advice.\nSometimes, one idea is all you need to change the direction of your life. Let\nme give you an example of what I mean:\nSome years ago, I was referred by a friend to an excellent dentist. I\nlearned later that he had a superb reputation. He was called the\n“dentist’s dentist.” He was the dentist that the other dentists went to\nwhen they needed excellent dental work. He told me that he attended\nevery major dental conference that he could. When he was there, he\nattended every session, listening to dentists from all the over the\ncountry, and all over the world, discuss the latest breakthroughs in\ndental technology.\n \nOne week, at great sacrifice in time and money, he attended an\ninternational dental conference in Hong Kong. At that conference, he\nsat in on a session given by a Japanese dentist who had discovered a\nnew technology in cosmetic surgery that improved the appearance of\nteeth and enabled people to look handsome or beautiful indefinitely.\n\f\nHe returned to San Diego and immediately began using the new\ntechnique in his practice. Soon, he became excellent in this area and\ndeveloped a national reputation. Within a couple of years, people were\ncoming to him from all over southwestern United States for this\ntreatment. Because he had developed this expertise, he could raise his\nfees again and again. Eventually, he had made so much money that he\nwas able to retire at the age of fifty-five, financially independent and\nable to spend the rest of his life with his family, traveling and fulfilling\nhis dreams.\n   \nThe point of this story is that, by continually seeking out ideas and advice\nfrom other experts in his field, he came across a new technology that helped\nhim become the leader in his field and saved him ten years of hard work in\norder to reach the same level of financial success. This could happen to you\nas well, but only if you become a lifelong student of your craft.\n\f\nMental and Physical Fitness Need to Be Ongoing\n \nAchieving success is like achieving physical fitness. It is like bathing,\nbrushing your teeth, and eating. It is something that you need to do\ncontinuously, every day. Once you begin, you never stop until your life and\ncareer are over and you have achieved all the success you desire.\n \nNot long ago, I was giving a seminar in Seattle. Just before the break, I\nencouraged people to buy and listen to my audio programs on sales,\ntime management, and personal success. At the break, several people\ncame up to me to ask me questions about the seminar content. One\nsalesman pushed his way forward and said, “When you encourage\npeople to buy your programs, you should tell them the whole truth.”\n \nI asked, “How do you mean?”\n \nHe went on to say, “You are not telling the whole truth about your\nprograms. You should tell people that they only work for a certain\nperiod of time, and then they stop working.”\n \nAgain, I asked, “How do you mean?”\n \nHe said, “Well, I came to your seminar about five years ago, and I\nwas completely convinced by your presentation. I bought all your\nprograms and began listening to them. I read every day in sales. And\nyou were right, over the next three years, I tripled my income and\nbecame the top seller in my company. But then my income flattened\n\f\nout and has not increased at all over the last two years. The fact is that\nyour materials stop working after a certain point.”\n \nI then asked him, “What happened to you two years ago, when your\nincome flattened out and stopped increasing?”\n \nHe searched his memory, thought for a while and then said, “Well, I\nwas selling so much that I was hired away by another company. Ever\nsince I started my new job, my income has remained flat.”\n \nI asked him, “What did you do differently in your new job in\ncomparison with your previous job?”\n \nHe started to answer. He then stopped. A shocked look came over\nhis face. Finally he replied, “Oh my gosh! I stopped doing it. When I\nchanged jobs, I stopped reading in sales. I stopped listening to audio\nprograms. I stopped attending seminars. I stopped doing it!”\n \nHe walked away shaking his head, muttering to himself, “I stopped\ndoing it. I stopped doing it. I stopped doing it.”\n  \nBecoming an expert in your field, continually upgrading your skills—\nwhich I will talk about in Chapter 5—is like physical fitness. If you stop\nexercising for any period of time, you don’t maintain your fitness at the\nsame level. You begin to decline. Your body and your muscles become\nsofter and weaker. You lose your strength, flexibility, and stamina. In order\nto maintain them, you must keep working at them every day, every week,\nand every month.\n\f\nBecome All You Can Be\n \nThere is an even more important reason for you to practice the self-\ndiscipline that leads onward and upward to the great successes that are\npossible for you. The practice of self-discipline enables you to change your\ncharacter , to become a stronger and better person. The exercise of self-\ndiscipline has a powerful effect on your mind and emotions, developing you\ninto a different person from the one that you would have been without self-\ndiscipline.\n \nImagine yourself in a chemistry lab. You mix a series of chemicals in a\nPetri dish and put it over a Bunsen burner. The Bunsen burner heats the\nchemicals to the point at which they crystallize and become hardened. But\nonce you have crystallized these chemicals using intense heat, they cannot\nbe transformed back into liquid form.\n \nIn the same way, your personality begins like a liquid: soft, fluid, and\nformless. But as you apply the heat of self-discipline, as you exert yourself\nto do what is hard and necessary rather than what is fun and easy, your\npersonality crystallizes and hardens at a higher level as well.\n \nThe greatest benefit you enjoy from exerting self-discipline in the pursuit\nof your goals is that you become a different person. You become stronger\nand more resolute. You develop greater self-control and determination. You\nactually shape and strengthen your personality and transform yourself into a\nbetter person.\n\f\nThe rule is that “to become someone that you have never been before,\nyou must do something that you have never done before.” This means that\nto develop a superior character, you must exert ever-higher levels of self-\ndiscipline and self-mastery on yourself. You must do the things that average\npeople don’t like to do.\n \nAnother success principle is that “to achieve something that you have\nnever achieved before, you must learn and practice qualities and skills that\nyou have never had before.”\n \nBy practicing self-discipline, you become a new person. You become\nbetter, stronger, and more clearly defined. You develop higher levels of self-\nesteem, self-respect, and personal pride. You move yourself up the ladder of\nhuman evolution and become a person of higher character and resolve.\n\f\nSuccess Is Its Own Reward\n \nThe wonderful thing about the achievement of success is that every step in\nthat direction is rewarding in itself. Each step you take toward becoming a\nbetter person and accomplishing more than you ever have before makes you\nfeel happier, more confident, and more fulfilled.\n \nYou’ve heard it said that “nothing succeeds like success.” What this\nmeans is that the greatest reward of success is not the money you make but\nrather the excellent person you become in the process of striving toward\nsuccess and exerting self-discipline every time it is required.\n \nIn the next chapter, I will explain how you can become the truly excellent\nperson you are capable of becoming.\n  \nAction Exercises:\n \nTake out a pen right now and write down your answers to the questions\nbelow.\n 1. If your work life and career were ideal, what would they\nlook like? What one discipline could you develop that would help\nyou to achieve it?\n2. If your family life were ideal, what would it look like, and\nwhat one discipline would help you the most to make it a reality?\n3. If your health were perfect in every way, what disciplines\nwould you have that make it possible?"

Be a hard\nmaster to yourself and be lenient to everyone else.”\n—HENRY WARD BEECHER,\nNINETEENTH-CENTURY CLERGYMAN\n \n \n \n \nThe development of character is the great business of life. Your ability to\ndevelop a reputation as a person of character and honor is the highest\nachievement of both social and business life. Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote,\n“What you do speaks so loudly that I cannot hear a word that you say.”\n \nThe person you are today, your innermost character, is the sum total of all\nyour choices and decisions in life up to this date. Each time you have\nchosen rightly and acted consistently with the very best that you know, you\nhave strengthened your character and become a better person. The reverse\nis also true: Each time you have compromised, taken the easy way, or\nbehaved in a manner inconsistent with what you knew to be right, you have\nweakened your character and softened your personality."

    "raw_text": "The Great Virtues\n \nThere are a series of virtues or values that are usually possessed by a person\nof character. These are courage, compassion, generosity, temperance,\npersistence, and friendliness, among others. We will talk about some of\nthem in Part 3 of this book. Coming before all these values, however, is the\nmost important one of all when determining the depth and strength of your\ncharacter: integrity.\n \nIt is your level of integrity, living in complete truth with yourself and\nothers, that demonstrates more than anything else the quality of your\ncharacter. In a way, integrity is actually the value that guarantees all the\nother values. When your level of integrity is higher, you are more honest\nwith yourself and more likely to live consistently with all the other values\nthat you admire and respect.\n \nHowever, it takes tremendous self-discipline to become a person of\ncharacter. It takes considerable willpower to always “do the right thing” in\nevery situation. And it takes both self-discipline and willpower to resist the\ntemptation to cut corners, take the easy way, or act for short-term\nadvantage.\n \nAll of life is a test, to see what you are really made of deep, down inside.\nWisdom can be developed in private through study and reflection, but\ncharacter can be developed only in the give and take of daily life, when\nyou are forced to choose and decide among alternatives and temptations.\n\f\nThe Test of Character\n \nIt is only when you are under pressure—when you are forced to choose one\nway or another, to either live consistently with a value or to compromise it\n—that you demonstrate your true character. Emerson also said, “Guard your\nintegrity as a sacred thing; nothing at last is sacred except the integrity of\nyour own mind.”\n \nYou are a “choosing organism.” You are constantly making choices, one\nway or the other. Every choice you make is a statement about your true\nvalues and priorities. At each moment, you choose what is more important\nor of higher value to you over what is less important or of lesser value.\n \nThe only bulwark against temptation, the path of least resistance, and the\nexpediency factor is character. The only way that you can develop your full\ncharacter is by exerting your willpower in every situation when you are\ntempted to do what is easy and expedient rather than what is correct and\nnecessary."

    "raw_text": "The Big Payoff\n \nThe payoff for becoming a person of character, for exerting your willpower\nand self-discipline to live consistently with the very best that you know, is\ntremendous. When you choose the higher value over the lower, the more\ndifficult over the easy, the right over the wrong, you feel good about\nyourself. Your self-esteem increases. You like and respect yourself more.\nYou have a greater sense of personal pride.\n \nIn addition to feeling excellent about yourself when you behave with\ncharacter, you also earn the respect and esteem of all the people around you.\nThey will look up to you and admire you. Doors will be opened for you.\nPeople will help you. You will be paid more, promoted faster, and given\neven greater responsibilities. As you become a person of honor and\ncharacter, opportunities will appear all around you.\n \nOn the other hand, you can have all the intelligence, talent, and ability in\nthe world, but if people do not trust you, you will never get ahead. People\nwill not hire you, and if they do, they will dehire you as soon as possible.\nFinancial institutions will not lend you money. Because “birds of a feather\nflock together,” the only associates (never friends) you will have will be\nother people of questionable character. Furthermore, since the people you\nassociate with have a major effect on your attitude and personality, you\nmake or break your entire life with the quality of your character—or the\nlack thereof.\n\f\nThe Development of Character\n \nAristotle wrote, “All advancement in society begins with the development\nof the character of the young.” This means that advancement in your life\nbegins with the learning and practice of values.\n \nYou learn values in one or all of three ways: instruction, study, and\npractice. Let’s look at each of these more closely.\n \nTeach Your Children Values. One of the chief roles of parenting is to teach\nchildren values. This requires patient instruction and explaining values to\nthem over and over again as they are growing up. Once is never enough.\nThe value—and the importance of living by that value—must be explained.\nParents must not only give illustrations but also contrast the adherence to a\nvalue, especially that of telling the truth with its opposite, that of lying or\ntelling half-truths.\n \nChildren are very susceptible to the lessons they receive from the\nimportant people in their lives as they are growing up. They accept what\nyou say as their parent as a fact, as absolute truth. They absorb what you\nsay like a sponge. You write your description of values on their souls, which\nare like wet clay, so that what you write becomes a permanent part of the\nway they see the world and relate to life.\n \nMore than anything else, as we’ll see in Chapter 19, you demonstrate\nyour values in your behavior. Your children watch you and strive to\nemulate the values that you not only teach and preach, but also practice.\nAnd they are always watching.\n\f\nThe Rockefeller family children were famous for being taught financial\nvalues at an early age. Even though their father was one of the richest men\nin America, the children were given tasks and chores to perform before they\nreceived their allowances. They were then instructed on how to spend their\nallowances: how to save, how much to give to charity, and how much to\ninvest. As a result, they grew up to become successful businessmen and\nstatesmen, unlike children who had grown up in wealthy homes who were\nseldom disciplined in money matters.\n  \nStudy the Values You Admire. You learn values by studying them closely.\nThe Law of Concentration says that “whatever you dwell upon grows and\nincreases in your life.”\n \nWhat this means is that when you study and read stories about men and\nwomen who demonstrated the kind of values that you admire and respect,\nand then think about those stories and that behavior, those values sink ever\ndeeper into your mind. Once these values are “programmed” into your\nsubconscious, they create a propensity within you to behave consistently\nwith those values when the situation requires them.\n \nFor example, in military training, soldiers are continually told stories of\ncourage, obedience, discipline, and the importance of supporting their\nfellow soldiers. The more they hear these stories, discuss them, and think\nabout them, the more likely they are to behave consistently with these\nvalues when they are under the pressure of actual combat.\n \nThe core virtue of character is truth. Whenever you tell the truth,\nhowever inconvenient it may be at the time, you feel better about yourself\nand you earn the respect of the people around you. One of the highest\naccolades you can pay another person is to say that “he or she always tells\nthe truth.”\n\f\nEmulate the People You Most Admire. Much of your character is\ndetermined by the people you most admire, both living and dead. Who are\nthey? Looking over your life and history, make a list of the people whom\nyou most admire, and next to their names, write out the virtues or values\nthat they most represent to you.\n \nIf you could spend an afternoon with anyone, living or dead, what one\nperson would you choose? Why would you choose that person? What\nwould you talk about during your afternoon together? What questions\nwould you ask, or what would you want to learn?\n \nConsider this as well: Why would that person want to spend an afternoon\nwith you? What are the virtues and values that you have developed that\nmake you a valuable and interesting person? What makes you special?\n  \nPractice the Values You Respect. You develop values by practicing them\nwhenever they are called for. As the Roman Stoic philosopher Epictetus\nsaid, “Circumstances do not make the man; they merely reveal him to\nhimself.”\n \nWhen a problem occurs, people tend to react automatically based on the\nhighest values that they have developed up to that moment.\n \nWe develop values by repetition, by behaving consistently with a\nparticular value over and over again, until it becomes a habit, and locks in\nso that we come to practice it automatically. Men and women with highly\ndeveloped characters behave in a manner consistent with their highest\nvalues, and they do so without thought or hesitation. There is no question in\ntheir minds about whether or not they are doing the right thing."

    "raw_text": "The Structure of Personality\n \nThe psychology of character involves the three parts of your personality:\nyour self-ideal, your self-image, and your self-esteem.\n  \nYour Self-Ideal. Your self-ideal is that part of your mind composed of your\nvalues, virtues, ideals, goals, aspirations, and your idea of the very best\nperson that you can possibly be. In other words, your self-ideal is composed\nof those values that you most admire in others and most aspire to possess in\nyourself.\n \nThe most important part of your self-ideal is summarized in the word\n“clarity.” Superior people are those who are absolutely clear about who they\nare and what they believe. They have complete clarity about the values they\nbelieve in and what they stand for. They are not confused or indecisive.\nThey are firm and resolute when it comes to any decision in which a value\nis involved.\n \nOn the other hand, weak and irresolute people are fuzzy and unclear\nabout their values. They have only a vague notion of what is right or wrong\nin any situation. As a result, they take the path of least resistance and act\nexpediently. They do whatever seems to be the fastest and easiest thing to\nget what they want in the short term, giving little to no consideration or\nconcern about the consequences of their acts.\n \nThe Evolution of Character. In biology, life forms are categorized from the\nleast to the most complex, from single-celled plankton all the way up the\n\f\nincreasingly complex spectrum of life to the human being. Similarly, human\nbeings can be organized along a spectrum as well, from the least to the most\ndeveloped. The lowest forms of humans are those with no values, virtues, or\ncharacter. These people always act expediently and take the path of least\nresistance in their search for immediate gratification.\n \nAt the highest levels of development of the human race, however, are\nthose men and women of complete integrity, who would never compromise\ntheir honesty or their character for anything, including the threat of\nfinancial loss, pain, or even death.\n \nGeorge Washington is famous for his honesty, which was demonstrated\nin the story in which he admitted that he had cut down the cherry tree. In\nthe same vein, the founding fathers of the United States wrote, “We hereby\npledge our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor” to the signing of the\nDeclaration of Independence.\n \nIn his book Trust: The Social Virtues and the Creation of Prosperity,\nphilosopher Francis Fukuyama observed that societies worldwide can be\ndivided into two kinds: “high-trust” and “low-trust.” He also argues that the\nhighest-trust societies—those in which integrity is most admired,\nencouraged, and respected—are also the most law-abiding, free, and\nprosperous.\n \nAt the other end of the societal spectrum, however, are those societies\ncharacterized by tyranny, thievery, dishonesty, and corruption. Each of these\nare, without exception, both undemocratic and poor.\n  \nTrust Is the Key. Trust is the lubricant of human relationships. Where there\nis high trust among and between people, economic activity flourishes and\nthere are opportunities for all. On the other hand, where there is low trust,\n\f\neconomic resources are squandered in an attempt to protect against thievery\nand corruption—or these resources are not available at all.\n \nIn the United States, we have the Constitution and Bill of Rights. These\ndocuments lay out the rules by which Americans agree to live. They create\nthe structure of our government and guarantee our rights. But they assume\nthat our elected representatives will be men and women of honor,\ncommitted to protecting and defending those rights. They attempt to assure\nthat only men and women of character can thrive and prosper over the long\nterm in our economic, political, and social system. They aim to assure that,\nin most cases, only men and women of character can rise to high positions\nin society.\n \nAlthough our system is not perfect, and people of questionable character\noccasionally rise to positions of prominence, it is seldom for very long. The\nbasic demand of Americans for honesty and integrity eventually leads to the\nexposure and censure of dishonest people. The demand for men and women\nof character continues unabated.\n  \nYour Self-Image: Your Inner Mirror. The second part of your personality\nis your self-image. This is the way we see and think about ourselves,\nespecially prior to any event of importance. People always tend to behave\non the outside consistently with the way they see themselves on the inside.\nThis is often called our “inner mirror,” into which we peer before we\nengage in any behavior.\n \nWhen you see yourself as calm, positive, truthful, and possessed of high\ncharacter, you behave with greater strength and personal power. Other\npeople respect you more. You feel in control of yourself and the situation.\n \nWhat’s more, whenever you actually behave in a manner that is\nconsistent with your highest values, your self-image improves. You see and\n\f\nthink about yourself in a better light. You feel happier and more confident.\nYour behavior and outward performance then reflect this increasingly\nimproving inner picture you have of yourself as the very best person you\ncan possibly be.\n \nPeople tend to accept you at your own evaluation of yourself, at least\ninitially. If you see and think of yourself as an excellent person who is\npossessed of high character, you will treat other people with courtesy, grace,\nand respect. In turn, they will likewise treat you as a person of honor and\ncharacter.\n  \nYour Self-Esteem: How Much You Like Yourself. The third part of your\npersonality is your self-esteem. This is how you feel about yourself, your\nemotional core. Your self-esteem is defined as “how much you like\nyourself,” but it’s more than only this. The more you see yourself as a\nvaluable and important person, the more positive and optimistic you will be.\nWhen you truly consider yourself to be important and worthwhile, you will\ntreat other people as if they are important as well.\n \nYour self-esteem is largely determined by how consistent your self-\nimage, which shapes your personal behavior, is with your self-ideal, or your\nvision of the very best person you can possibly be.\n \nWhenever you act consistently with who you consider an excellent\nperson to be, your self-image improves and your self-esteem increases. You\nlike and respect yourself more. You feel happy about yourself and others.\nThe more you like yourself, the more you like others, and the more they\nlike you in return. By acting with character and in harmony with your\nhighest values, you put your entire life (internally and externally) into an\nupward spiral. In every area of your life, things will get better and better for\nyou.\n\f\nYour role models have a tremendous impact on shaping your character.\nThe more you admire a person and his or her qualities, the more you strive\n—both consciously and unconsciously—to become like that person. This is\nwhy clarity is so important.\n\f\nAlways Behave Consistently\n \nWhenever you act in a way that is consistent with your values, you feel\ngood about yourself. Whenever you compromise your values, for any\nreason, you feel bad about yourself. This also means that when you\ncompromise your values, your self-confidence and self-esteem go down.\nYou feel uneasy and inferior, inadequate and uncomfortable. When you\ncompromise your values, deep down inside, you feel that something is\nfundamentally wrong.\n \nAlmost all human problems can be solved by a return to your highest\nvalues and your innermost convictions. When you look back, there have\nprobably been situations in your life when you have compromised your\nvalues in order to save an investment, keep a job, preserve a relationship, or\nmaintain a friendship. In each case, you have felt worse and worse until you\nfinally broke it off and walked away.\n \nAnd how did you feel when you finally had the strength of character to\nwalk away? You felt wonderful! Whenever you use your willpower and\nstrength of character to return to the values that are most dear to you, you\nare rewarded with a wonderful feeling of happiness and exhilaration. You\nfeel energized and free. You wonder why you didn’t make that decision a\nlong time ago."

    "raw_text": "Do the Right Thing\n \nIn the development of character that is based on self-discipline and\nwillpower, long-term thinking is essential. The more you think about the\nlong-term consequences of your behavior, the more likely it is that you will\ndo the right thing in the short term. So when you have to make a choice or\ndecision, always ask the magic question, “What’s important here?”\n \nPractice the Universal Maxim of Immanuel Kant: “Resolve to behave as\nthough your every act were to become a universal law for all people.”\n \nOne of the great questions for the development of character is this:\n“What kind of a world would this world be if everyone in it was just like\nme?”\n \nWhenever you slip, whenever you do or say something that is\ninconsistent with your highest values, immediately “get back on your\nhorse.” Say to yourself, “This is not like me!” and resolve that next time\nyou will do better."

    "raw_text": "What You Dwell Upon Grows\n \nIf you are in a situation today in which you are not living up to your highest\nvalues, make a decision, this very minute, to confront the situation and\nstraighten it out. The minute you do, you will once again feel happy and\nback in control.\n \nThere is an old Indian story: “On my shoulders are two wolves. One is\na black wolf, evil, who continually tempts me to do and say the wrong\nthings. On my other shoulder is a white wolf that continually\nencourages me to live up to my very best.”\n \nA listener asked the old man, “Which of these wolves has the\ngreatest power over you?”\n \nThe old man replied, “The one I feed.”\n  \nBy the Law of Concentration, whatever you dwell on grows and\nincreases in your life.

What situations give you your greatest feelings of self-\nesteem and personal worth?\n5. If you were already an excellent person in every respect,\nhow would you behave differently from today onward?\n6. What one quality would you like people to think of when\nyour name is mentioned, and what could you do to ensure this\nhappens?\n7.

    "raw_text": "When I was twenty-one, I was living in a tiny apartment and working\nas a construction laborer. I had to get up at 5:00 A.M. so that I could\ntake three buses to work in order to be there by 8:00 A.M. I didn’t get\nhome until 7:00 P.M., tired out from carrying construction materials all\nday. I was making just enough money to get by, and I had no car,\nalmost no savings, and just enough clothes for my needs. I had no\nradio or television.\n \nIt was the middle of a cold winter, with the temperature at minus 35\ndegrees Fahrenheit, so I seldom went out in the evening. Instead, if I\nhad enough energy, I sat in my small apartment at my little table in my\nkitchen nook and read.\n \nOne evening, late at night, as I was sitting there by myself at the\ntable, it suddenly dawned on me that “this is my life.” This life was not\na rehearsal for something else. The game was on, and I was the main\ncharacter, as in a play.\n \nIt was like a flashbulb going off in my face. I looked at myself and\naround me at my small apartment, and I considered the fact that I had\nnot graduated from high school. The only work that I was qualified to\ndo was manual labor. I earned just enough money to pay my basic\nexpenses, and I had very little left over at the end of each month.\n \nI suddenly knew that unless I changed, nothing else was going to\nchange. No one else was going to do it for me. In reality, no one else\ncared. I realized at that moment that, from that day forward I was\ncompletely responsible for my life and for everything that happened to\nme. I was responsible. I could no longer blame my situation on my\ndifficult childhood or mistakes I had made in the past. I was in charge.\nI was in the driver’s seat. This was my life, and if I didn’t do\nsomething to change it, it would go on like this indefinitely, by the\nsimple force of inertia.\n\f\nThis revelation changed my life. I was never the same again. From\nthat moment on, I accepted more and more responsibility for\neverything in my life. I accepted responsibility for doing my job better\nthan before rather than doing only the minimum that was necessary to\navoid getting fired. I accepted responsibility for my finances, my\nhealth, and, especially, my future.\n \nThe very next day, I went down to a local bookstore at my lunch\nbreak and began the lifelong practice of buying books with\ninformation, ideas, and lessons that could help me. I dedicated my life\nto self-improvement, to continuous learning in every way possible.\n \nFor the rest of my business life, right up to the present moment,\nwhenever I’ve wanted or needed to learn something to help me, I have\nreturned to learning, to reading, to listening to audio programs and\nattending courses and seminars. I found that you could learn anything\nyou need to learn in order to accomplish any goal you set for yourself.\n \nOver time, I learned that fully 80 percent of the population never\naccepts complete responsibility for their lives. They continually\ncomplain, criticize, make excuses, and blame other people for things in\ntheir lives about which they are not happy. The consequences of this\nway of thinking, however, can be disastrous. They can sabotage all\nhopes for success and happiness later in life.\n\f\nFrom Childhood to Maturity\n \nWhen you are growing up, from an early age you become conditioned to\nsee yourself as not responsible for your life. This is normal and natural.\nWhen you are a child, your parents are in charge. They make all your\ndecisions. They decide what food you will eat, what clothes you will wear,\nwhat toys you will play with, what home you will live in, what school you\nwill attend, and what activities you will engage in during your spare time.\nBecause you are young, innocent, and unknowing, you do what they want\nyou to do. You have little choice or control.\n \nAs you grow up, however, you begin to make more and more of your\nown decisions in each of these areas. But because of your early\nprogramming, you are conditioned unconsciously to feel that someone else\nis still responsible for your life, that there is still someone else out there\nwho can or should take care of you.\n \nMost people grow up believing that if something goes wrong, someone\nelse is responsible. Someone else is to blame. Someone else is guilty.\nSomeone else is the villain and they are the victim. As a result, most people\nmake more and more excuses for the things in their lives, past and present,\nthat make them unhappy.\n\f\nGet Over the Mistakes Your Parents Made\n \nIf your parents criticized you or got angry with you for mistakes you made\nwhen you were growing up, you began to unconsciously assume that\nsomehow you were at fault. If your parents punished you physically or\nemotionally for doing or not doing something that pleased or displeased\nthem, you felt inferior and inadequate.\n \nWhen your parents withheld their love to punish you for not doing\nsomething they demanded, you might have grown up with deep feelings of\nguilt, unworthiness, and undeservingness. All these negative feelings could\nthen intersect to make you feel like a victim, like you were not responsible\nfor yourself or your life once you became an adult.\n \nThe most common feeling that we have as adults if we have been raised\nin a critical home environment is the feeling that “I’m not good enough.”\nBecause of this feeling, we compare ourselves unfavorably to others. We\nthink that other people who seem to be happier or more confident are better\nthan us. We develop feelings of inferiority. This can become an emotional\ntrap.\n\f\nThe Fatal Fallacy\n \nIf we think for any reason that others are better than us, we unconsciously\nassume that we must be worse than they are. If they are “worth more” than\nwe are, we assume that we must be “worth less.” This feeling of inadequacy\nor worthlessness lies at the root of most personality problems in our lives as\nwell as most political and social problems in our world, both nationally and\ninternationally.\n \nTo escape from these feelings of guilt and worthlessness that have been\ninstilled in us as the result of destructive criticism in childhood, we lash out\nat our world, other people, and situations. In any part of our life with which\nwe are unhappy or discontented, our first reaction is to look around and ask,\n“Who’s to blame?”\n \nMost religions teach the concept of sin, which states that whenever\nsomething goes wrong, someone is to blame. Someone has done something\nbad. Someone is guilty. Someone must be punished. This whole idea of\nguilt and punishment leads to ever-increasing feelings of anger, resentment,\nand irresponsibility."

    "raw_text": "An Attitude of Irresponsibility\n \nOur courts today are clogged with thousands of people demanding redress\nand payment for something that went wrong in their lives. Backed up by\nambitious plaintiff lawyers, people go to court demanding compensation,\neven if they themselves are completely at fault for what happened—\nespecially if they are at fault.\n \nPeople don’t want to accept responsibility. People spill hot coffee on\nthemselves and sue the fast food restaurant that sold them the coffee in the\nfirst place. People get drunk and drive off the road and then turn around and\nsue the manufacturer of the fifteen-year-old car they were driving. People\nclimb up on a stepladder and lean over too far, falling to the ground. They\nthen sue the ladder manufacturer for their injury. In each case, people are\nattempting to escape responsibility for their own behaviors by blaming\nsomeone else, making excuses, and then demanding compensation.\n\f\nEliminating Negative Emotions\n \nThe common denominator of all people is the desire to be happy. In its\nsimplest terms, happiness arises from the absence of negative emotions.\nWhere there are no negative emotions, all that is left is positive emotions.\nTherefore, the elimination of negative emotions is your great business in\nlife if you truly wish to be happy.\n \nThere are dozens of negative emotions. Although the most common are\nguilt, resentment, envy, jealousy, fear, and hostility, they all ultimately boil\ndown to a feeling of anger, directed either inward or outward.\n \nAnger is directed inwardly when you bottle it up rather than expressing it\nconstructively to others. Anger is directed outwardly when you criticize or\nattack other people."

    "raw_text": "Psychosomatic Illness\n \nNegative emotions are the major causes of psychosomatic illness. This\noccurs when the mind (psycho) makes the body (soma) sick. Negative\nemotions, especially as expressed in the form of anger, weaken your\nimmune system and make you susceptible to colds, flu, and other diseases.\nUncontrolled bursts of anger can actually bring about heart attacks, strokes,\nand nervous breakdowns.\n \nHere is the great discovery: All negative emotions, especially anger,\ndepend for their very existence on your ability to blame someone or\nsomething else for something in your life that you are not happy about.\n \nIt takes tremendous self-discipline to refrain from blaming others for our\nproblems. It takes enormous self-control to refuse to make excuses.\n \nIt takes tremendous self-discipline for you to accept complete\nresponsibility for everything you are, everything you become, and\neverything that happens to you. Even if you are not directly responsible for\nsomething that happens, like hurricane Katrina, you are responsible for your\nresponses, for what you do and say from that moment forward. It takes\ntremendous self-mastery for you to take complete control of your conscious\nmind and deliberately choose to think positive, constructive thoughts that\nenhance your life and improve the quality of your relationships and results.\nBut the payoff is tremendous.\n\f\nBlaming Is Easy\n \nBy following the path of least resistance, the easiest and most mindless\nbehavior of all is for a person to lash out and blame someone else anytime\nanything goes wrong, for any reason.\n \nPeople who develop the habit of automatically blaming often become\nangry at things. Blaming inanimate objects when they do not function as\nexpected is so silly that it almost becomes a mild form of insanity.\n \nPeople become angry at doors that stick. They swear at tools they are\nusing when they themselves make a mistake. They get mad when their car\ndoesn’t start. Even if it is an inanimate object, if it doesn’t work perfectly,\nthen the thing must be to blame. People will often kick a car that they are\nmad at or a box that they tripped over.\n\f\nThe Antidote to Negative Emotions\n \nThe fastest and most dependable way to eliminate negative emotions is to\nimmediately say, “I am responsible!” Whenever something happens that\ntriggers anger or a negative reaction of any kind, quickly neutralize the\nfeelings of negativity by saying, “I am responsible.”\n \nThe Law of Substitution says that you can substitute a positive thought\nfor a negative one. Since your mind can hold only one thought at a time,\nwhen you deliberately choose the positive thought, “I am responsible,” you\ncancel out any other thought or emotion at that moment.\n \nIt is not possible to accept responsibility and remain angry at the same\ntime. It is not possible to accept responsibility and experience negative\nemotions. It is not possible to accept responsibility without becoming calm,\nclear, positive, and focused once more.\n \nAs long as you are blaming someone else for something in your life that\nyou don’t like, you will remain a “mental child.” You continue to see\nyourself as small and helpless, like a victim. You continue to lash out.\nHowever, when you begin to accept responsibility for everything that\nhappens to you, you transform yourself into a “mental adult.” You will see\nyourself as being in charge of your own life, and no longer a victim.\n \nIn Alcoholics Anonymous, people who are having problems with\ndrinking attend meetings with others going through the same situation.\nWhat they have found is that until the individual accepts responsibility for\nhis or her problems, both with alcohol and in other areas of life, no progress\n\f\nis possible. But after the person accepts responsibility, everything is\npossible. This is true with almost every difficult situation in life in which\nyou project your unhappiness onto other people or factors outside yourself.\n\f\nMoney and Emotions\n \nMany of our biggest problems and concerns in life have to do with money:\nearning it, spending it, investing it, and, especially, losing it. As a result,\nmany of our negative emotions are associated with money in some way.\nHowever, the fact is that you are responsible for your financial life. You\nchoose. You decide. You are in charge. You cannot blame your financial\nproblems or situation on other people. You are in the driver’s seat.\n \nSo it is only when you accept responsibility for your income (who chose\nto accept the job you are working at?), your bills (who spent the money that\nput you into debt?), and your investments (who made those decisions?) can\nyou move from being an “economic child” to an “economic adult.”\n\f\nResponsibility and Control\n \nThere is a direct relationship between the acceptance of responsibility and\nthe amount of personal control you feel you have over your life. This means\nthat the more you accept responsibility, the greater sense of control you\nexperience.\n \nThere is also a direct relationship between the amount of control you feel\nyou have and how positive you feel. The more you feel that you have a high\n“sense of control” in the important areas of your life, the more positive and\nhappy you are in everything you do.\n \nWhen you accept responsibility, you feel strong, powerful, and\npurposeful. Accepting responsibility eliminates the negative emotions that\nrob you of happiness and contentment.\n \nIn every situation, the antidote to negative emotions is to say, “I am\nresponsible.” Then look into the situation to find the reasons why you are\nresponsible for what happened or for what is going on.\n \nYour intelligence is like a double-edged sword: It can cut in either\ndirection. You can use your intelligence to rationalize, justify, and blame\nother people for things you are not happy about, or you can use your\nintelligence to find reasons why you are responsible for what happened and\nthen take action to solve the problem or resolve the situation. You can make\nexcuses or you can make progress. You choose.\n\f\nEven if an accident has occurred, such as your car being damaged in the\nparking lot while you are at work, you may not be legally at fault for the\naccident. But you are still responsible for your responses, for how you\nbehave as a result of what happened."

    "raw_text": "Never Complain, Never Explain\n \nThe mark of the leader, the truly superior person, is that he or she accepts\ncomplete responsibility for the situation. It is not possible to imagine a true\nleader who whines and complains rather than taking action when problems\nand difficulties arise.\n \nThis sense of “response-ability” is the mark of the highly developed\npersonality: You take responsibility for your life by resolving, in advance,\nthat you will not become upset or angry over something that you cannot\naffect or change. Just as you do not become angry about the weather, you\ndo not become angry over circumstances and situations over which you\nhave no control.\n \nFurthermore, you especially do not allow yourself to be angry and\nunhappy in the present because of unhappy experiences or situations from\nthe past. You say, “What cannot be cured must be endured.”\n \nIt is amazing how many people are unhappy today because of a past\nevent, even something that happened many years ago. Each time they think\nof the negative experience, they become angry or depressed once again. The\ngood news is that at any time, you can stop thinking about, discussing, and\nrehashing the past. You can let it go and begin thinking instead about your\ngoals and your unlimited future. As Helen Keller said, “When you turn\ntoward the sunshine, the shadows fall behind you.”\n\f\nSelf-Mastery and Self-Control\n \nAny self-discipline, self-mastery, and self-control begin with taking\nresponsibility for your emotions. You take charge of your emotions by\naccepting 100 percent responsibility for yourself and for your responses to\neverything that happens to you. You refuse to make excuses, complain,\ncriticize, or blame other people for anything. Instead, you say, “I am\nresponsible,” and then take action of some kind.\n\f\nThe Only Antidote Is Action\n \nThe only real antidote for anger or worry is purposeful action in the\ndirection of your goals—which is the subject of the next chapter. Before\nyou turn to that, however, resolve today to first take complete control of\nyour thoughts, feeling, and actions, and then to get so busy working on\nthings that are important to you that you don’t have time to think about or\nexpress negative emotions to or about anyone, for any reason.\n \nWhen you exert your self-discipline and willpower in the acceptance of\npersonal responsibility for your life, you take complete control of your\nthoughts and feelings. By doing so, you become a much more effective,\nhappy, and positive person in everything you do.\n  \nAction Exercises:\n 1. Resolve today to accept 100 percent responsibility for\neverything you are and for everything you become. Never\ncomplain, never explain.\n2. Look into your past and select a person or incident that\nstill makes you unhappy today. Instead of justifying your negative\nfeelings, look for reasons why you were partially responsible for\nwhat happened.\n3. Select a relationship in your past that made you unhappy,\nand then give three reasons why you were responsible for what\noccurred.\n4. Select one person in your past with whom you are still\nangry and resolve to forgive that person completely for what\n\f\nhappened. This act will liberate you emotionally.\n5. Accept complete responsibility for your financial situation\nand refuse to blame any financial problems on anyone else. Now,\nwhat steps are you going to take to resolve that situation?\n6. Accept complete responsibility for your family situation,\nwith each person, and then take immediate action to improve your\nrelationships wherever there may be problems.\n7. Accept 100 percent responsibility for your health. Resolve\ntoday to do or stop doing whatever is necessary for you to attain\nexcellent all-around health."

You need to have goals to accomplish worthwhile\nthings in life. You have probably heard it said that “you can’t hit a target\nthat you can’t see.”\n \n“If you don’t know where you’re going, any road will get you there.”\n \nAnd as Wayne Gretsky said, “You miss every shot you don’t take.”\n \nThe very act of taking the time to decide what you really want in each\narea of your life can change your life completely."

    "raw_text": "The 3 Percent Factor\n \nIt seems that only 3 percent of adults have written goals and plans, and this\n3 percent earn more than all of the other 97 percent put together.\n \nWhy is this? The simplest answer is that if you have clear goal and a plan\nto achieve it, you therefore have a track to run on every single day. Instead\nof being sidetracked by distractions and diversions, getting lost or going\nastray, more and more of your time is focused in a straight line—from\nwhere you are to where you want to go. This is why people with goals\naccomplish so much more than people without them.\n \nThe tragedy is that most people think that they already have goals. But\nwhat they really have are hopes and wishes. However, hope is not a strategy\nfor success, and a wish has been defined as a “goal with no energy behind\nit.”\n \nGoals that are not written down and developed into plans are like bullets\nwithout powder in the cartridge. People with unwritten goals go through life\nshooting blanks. Because they think they already have goals, they never\nengage in the hard, disciplined effort of goal-setting—and this is the master\nskill of success."

    "raw_text": "The Discipline of Writing\n \nIn my experience of working with several million people over the past\ntwenty-five years, the disciplined act of writing out goals, making plans for\naccomplishing them, and then working on those goals daily increases the\nlikelihood of achieving your goals by ten times, or 1,000 percent.\n \nThis does not mean that writing out your goals guarantees success, but\nrather that it increases the probability of success by ten times. These are\nvery good odds to have working in your favor, especially when there is no\ncost or risk involved in putting pen to paper—just a little time.\n \nWriting is called a “psycho-neuro-motor activity.” The act of writing\nforces you to think and concentrate. It forces you to choose what is more\nimportant to you and your future. As a result, when you write down a goal,\nyou impress it into your subconscious mind, which then goes to work\ntwenty-four hours a day to bring your goal to reality.\n \nSometimes I tell my seminar audiences, “Only 3 percent of adults have\nwritten goals, and everyone else works for those people.” In life, you either\nwork to achieve your own goals or you work to achieve the goals of\nsomeone else. Which is it going to be?\n\f\nSuccess Versus Failure Mechanisms\n \nYour brain has both a success mechanism and a failure mechanism. The\nfailure mechanism is the temptation to follow the undisciplined path of least\nresistance, to do what is fun and easy rather than what is hard and nec -\nessary. Your failure mechanism operates automatically throughout your life,\nwhich is the major reason why most people fail to fulfill their individual\npotentials.\n \nWhile your failure mechanism functions automatically, your success\nmechanism is triggered by a goal. When you decide on a goal, you override\nyour failure mechanism, and can you change the direction of your life. You\ngo from being a ship without a rudder, drifting with the tide, to being a ship\nwith a rudder, a compass, and a clear destination, sailing in a straight\ndirection toward your goal.\n \nTHE POWER OF GOALS\n \nA client of mine recently told me an interesting story. He said he had\nattended one of my seminars in 1994, where I spoke about the\nimportance of writing down goals and making plans for accomplishing\nthem. At that time, he was thirty-five years old, selling cars for a\ndealership in Nashville, and earning about $50,000 a year.\n \nHe told me that day changed his life. He began writing out his goals\nand plans and working on them daily. Twelve years later, he was\nearning more than $1 million a year and was the president of a fast-\ngrowing company that sells services to some of the biggest companies\n\f\nin the country. He told me he could not imagine what his life would\nhave been like if he had not taken out a piece of paper and written\ndown the goals he wanted to achieve in the years ahead.\n\f\nTake Control of Your Life\n \nAristotle wrote that human beings are teleological organisms, which simply\nmeans that we are purpose driven. Therefore, you feel happy and in control\nof your life only when you have a clear goal that you are working toward\neach day. This also means that this ability to become a lifelong goal setter is\none of the most important disciplines you will ever develop.\n \nIn nature, the homing pigeon is a remarkable bird. It has an uncanny\ninstinct that enables it to fly back to its home roost, no matter how far away\nit starts or in what direction it must go. You can take a homing pigeon out of\nits roost, put it in a cage, put the cage in a box, cover the box with a blanket,\nand put the covered box in the back of a pickup truck. You could then drive\n1,000 miles in any direction, open up the truck, take out the box, take off\nthe blanket, open the cage, and throw the homing pigeon up into the air.\n \nThe homing pigeon will circle three times, get its bearings, and then fly\nstraight back to its home roost. This is the only creature on earth that has\nthis ability—except for human beings. Except for you.\n \nYou also have this remarkable homing ability within your own brain, but\nwith one special difference. The homing pigeon seems to know instinctively\nexactly where its home roost is located. It then has the ability to fly directly\nback to that roost. In contrast, when human beings program a goal into their\nminds, they can then set out without having any idea where they will go or\nhow they will achieve that goal. But by some miracle, they will begin to\nmove unerringly toward that goal, and the goal will begin to move toward\nthem.\n\f\nStill, many people are hesitant to set goals. They say, “I want to be\nfinancially independent, but I have no idea how I’m going to get there.” As\na result, they don’t even set financial success as a goal. But the good news\nis that you don’t need to know how to get there. You just need to be clear\nabout what you want to accomplish, and the goal-striving mechanism in\nyour brain will guide you unerringly to your destination.\n \nFor example, you can decide that you are going to find your ideal job, in\nwhich you work for and with people you like and respect and do work that\nis both challenging and enjoyable. You take some time to write down an\nexact description of what your ideal job and workplace would look like, and\nthen you go out into the job market and begin searching.\n \nAfter a series of interviews, you will often walk into the right place at the\nright time and find yourself in exactly the right job. Almost everyone has\nhad this experience at one time or another. You can have it by design rather\nthan by chance simply by developing absolute clarity about what you really\nwant."

    "raw_text": "The Seven-Step Method to Achieving Your Goals\n \nThere are seven simple steps that you can follow to set and achieve your\ngoals faster. There are more complex and detailed goal-achieving\nmethodologies, but this Seven-Step Method will enable you to accomplish\nten times more than you have ever accomplished before, and you will do so\nfar faster than you can currently imagine.\n  \nStep 1: Decide Exactly What You Want. Be specific. If you want to\nincrease your income, decide on a specific amount of money rather than to\njust “make more money.”\n  \nStep 2: Write It Down. A goal that is not in writing is like cigarette smoke:\nIt drifts away and disappears. It is vague and insubstantial. It has no force,\neffect, or power. But a written goal becomes something that you can see,\ntouch, read, and modify if necessary.\n  \nStep 3: Set a Deadline for Your Goal. Pick a reasonable time period and\nwrite down the date when you want to achieve it. If it is a big enough goal,\nset a final deadline and then set subdeadlines or interim steps between\nwhere you are today and where you want to be in the future.\n \nA deadline serves as a “forcing system” in your brain. Just as you often\nget more done when you are under the pressure of a specific deadline, your\n\f\nsubconscious mind works faster and more efficiently when you have\ndecided that you want to achieve a goal by a specific time.\n \nThe rule is “There are no unrealistic goals; there are only unrealistic\ndeadlines.”\n \nWhat do you do if you don’t achieve your goal by your deadline? Simple.\nYou set another deadline. A deadline is just a “guesstimate.” Sometimes\nyou will achieve your goal before the deadline, sometimes at the deadline,\nand sometimes after the deadline.\n \nWhen you set your goal, it will be within the context of a certain set of\nexternal circumstances. But these circumstances may change, causing you\nto change your deadline as well.\n  \nStep 4: Make a List of Everything You Can Think of That You Could\nPossibly Do to Achieve Your Goal. As Henry Ford said, “The biggest goal\ncan be accomplished if you just break it down into enough small steps.”\n • Make a list of the obstacles and difficulties that you will have to\novercome, both external and internal, in order to achieve your goal.\n• Make a list of the additional knowledge and skills that you will\nneed in order to achieve your goal.\n• Make a list of the people whose cooperation and support you\nwill require to achieve your goal.\n• Make a list of everything that you can think of that you will\nhave to do, and then add to this list as new tasks and responsibilities\noccur to you. Keep writing until your list is complete.\nStep 5: Organize Your List by Both Sequence and Priority. A list of\nactivities organized by sequence requires that you decide what you need to\ndo first, what you need to do second, and what you need to do later on. In\n\f\naddition, a list organized by priority enables you to determine what is more\nimportant and what is less important.\n \nSometimes sequence and priority are the same, but often they are not. For\nexample, if you want to start a particular kind of business, the first item in\norder of sequence might be for you to purchase a book or enroll in a course\non that business.\n \nBut what is most important is your ability to develop a business plan,\nbased on complete market research, that you can use to gather the resources\nyou need and actually start the business you have in mind.\n  \nStep 6: Take Action on Your Plan Immediately. Take the first step—and\nthen the second step and the third step. Get going. Get busy. Move quickly.\nDon’t delay. Remember: Procrastination is not only the thief of time; it is\nthe thief of life.\n \nThe difference between successes and failures in life is simply that\nwinners take the first step. They are action-oriented. As they said in Star\nTrek, they “go boldly where no man has ever gone before.” Winners are\nwilling to take action with no guarantees of success. Though they’re willing\nto face failure and disappointment, they’re always willing to take action.\n  \nStep 7: Do Something Every Day That Moves You in the Direction of\nYour Major Goal. This is the key step that will guarantee your success: Do\nsomething, seven days a week, 365 days a year. Do anything that moves\nyou at least one step closer to the goal that is most important to you at that\ntime.\n \nWhen you do something every day that moves you in the direction of\nyour goal, you develop momentum. This momentum, this sense of forward\n\f\nmotion, motivates, inspires, and energizes you. As you develop momentum,\nyou will find it increasingly easy to take even more steps toward your goal.\n \nIn no time at all, you will have developed the discipline of setting and\nachieving your goals. It will soon become easy and automatic. You will\nsoon develop the habit and the discipline of working toward your goals all\nthe time.\n\f\nThe Ten-Goal Exercise\n \nThis is one of the most powerful goal-achieving methods I have ever\ndiscovered. I teach it all over the world, and I practice it myself almost\nevery day.\n \nTake out a clean sheet of paper. At the top of the page write the word\n“Goals” and today’s date. Then, discipline yourself to write down ten goals\nthat you’d like to accomplish in the next twelve months. Write down\nfinancial, family goals, and fitness goals, as well as goals for personal\npossessions, like a house or a car.\n \nDon’t worry for the moment about how you are going to achieve these\ngoals. Just write them down as quickly as you can. You can write as many\nas fifteen goals if you like, but this exercise requires that you write down a\nminimum of ten within three to five minutes."

    "raw_text": "Select One Goal\n \nOnce you have written out your ten goals, imagine for the moment that you\ncan achieve all of the goals on your list if you want them long enough and\nhard enough. Also imagine that you have a “magic wand” that you can\nwave that will enable you to achieve any one goal on your list within\ntwenty-four hours.\n \nIf you could achieve any one goal on your list within twenty-four hours,\nwhich one would have the greatest positive impact on your life right now?\nWhich one goal would change or improve your life more than anything\nelse? Which one goal, if you were to achieve it, would help you to achieve\nmore of your other goals than anything else?\n \nWhatever your answer to this question, put a circle around this goal and\nthen write it at the top of a clean sheet of paper. This goal then becomes\nyour “Major Definite Purpose.” It becomes your focal point and the\norganizing principle of your future activities.\n\f\nMake a Plan\n \nOnce you have written out this goal, clearly and specifically, and made it\nmeasurable, set a deadline on your goal. Your subconscious mind needs a\ndeadline so that it can focus and concentrate all your mental powers on goal\nattainment.\n \nMake a list of everything that you can think of that you could do to\nachieve your goal. Organize this list by sequence and priority.\n \nSelect the most important or logical next step in your plan and take action\non it immediately. Take the first step. Do something. Do anything.\n \nResolve to work on this goal every single day until it is achieved. From\nthis moment forward, as far as you are concerned, “Failure is not an\noption.” Once you have decided that this one goal can have the greatest\npositive impact on your life and you have set it as your major definite\npurpose, resolve that you will work toward this goal as hard as you can, as\nlong as you can, and that you will never give up until it is achieved. This\ndecision alone can change your life.\n\f\nUse “Mindstorming” to Get Started\n \nHere is another technique you can use to dramatically increase the\nlikelihood that you will achieve your most important goal. This is the most\npowerful creative thinking technique I have ever seen. More people have\nbecome wealthy using this method than any other way.\n \nTake another clean sheet of paper. Write out your Major Definite Purpose\nat the top of the page in the form of a question. Then discipline yourself to\nwrite a minimum of twenty answers to the question.\n \nFor example, if your goal is to earn a certain amount of money by a\ncertain date, you would write the question as, “How can I earn $XXX by\nthis specific date?”\n \nYou then discipline yourself to generate twenty answers to your question.\nThis exercise of “mindstorming” will activate your mind, unleash your\ncreativity, and give you ideas that you may never have thought of before.\n \nThe first three to five answers will be easy. The next five will be difficult,\nand the last ten answers will be harder than you can imagine, at least the\nfirst time you do this exercise. Nonetheless, you must exert your discipline\nand willpower to persist until you have written down at least twenty\nanswers.\n \nOnce you have generated twenty answers, look over your list and select\none of those answers to take action on immediately. It seems that when you\n\f\ntake action on a single idea on your list, it triggers more ideas and motivates\nyou to take action on even more of these answers.\n\f\nThe Great Law of Cause and Effect\n \nThe most important application of the law of cause and effect is that\n“thoughts are causes, and conditions are effects.”\n \nYour thoughts create the conditions of your life. When you change your\nthinking, you change your life. Your outer world becomes a mirror-image\nreflection of your inner world.\n \nPerhaps the greatest discovery in the history of thought is that “you\nbecome what you think about most of the time.” Moreover, the teacher John\nBoyle said, “Whatever you can think about on a continuing basis, you can\nhave.”\n \nNapoleon Hill, author of the success classic Think and Grow Rich—\nwhich was first published in 1939 and is still selling today—said,\n“Whatever the mind of man can conceive and believe, it can achieve.”\n \nWhen you think about your goal continually and work on it every day,\nmore and more of your mental resources will be concentrated on moving\nyou toward that goal—and moving your goal toward you.\n \nThe discipline of daily goal-setting will make you a powerful,\npurposeful, and irresistible person. You will develop self-esteem, self-\nconfidence, and self-respect. As you feel yourself moving toward your\ngoals faster and faster, you will ultimately become unstoppable."

Every\nbit of education, experience, and hard work that you have invested in\nlearning your craft and developing your skills has gone into building this\nasset.\n \nYour earning ability is very much like a muscle. It can increase in\nstrength and power year by year as the result of regular exercise. Likewise,\nthe opposite is true, too: If left alone or ignored, your earning ability, like\nyour muscles, can become weaker or even decline because you have simply\nfailed to upgrade it continually.\n \nIn other words, your earning ability can be either an appreciating or a\ndepreciating asset. An appreciating asset is something that grows in value\nand cash flow every year as the result of continual investment and\nimprovement. A depreciating asset, on the other hand, is something that\nloses value over time and finally reaches the point at which it is “written\noff,” being of little or no further value. The choice is yours as to whether\nyour earning ability is increasing or decreasing month by month and year\nby year.\n\f\nYou Are the President\n \nSee yourself as the president of your own “Personal Services\nCorporation.” Imagine that you were going to take your company public on\nthe stock market. Would you recommend your company as a growth stock,\ncontinually increasing its value and earning ability each year?\n \nOr would you describe your company as one that has leveled off in the\nmarket place, that is not really going anywhere in terms of increased value\nand income? Would you recommend stock in “You, Inc.” as an excellent\ninvestment? Why or why not?\n\f\nWhat Got You Here Won’t Get You Any Further\n \nSome people are actually losing value each year, declining in earning\nability, because they are not continually upgrading their knowledge and\nskills. They don’t realize that whatever knowledge and skill they have today\nis rapidly becoming obsolete. It is being replaced by new knowledge and\nskills that, if you don’t have them and someone else does, you will be in\ndanger of being overtaken by your competition.\n\f\nJoin the Top 20 Percent\n \nIn Chapter 1, I mentioned that the 80/20 rule applies to income: The top 20\npercent of people in our society earn and control 80 percent of the assets.\nAccording to Forbes, Fortune, Business Week, the Wall Street Journal,\nand the IRS, by many estimates the top 1 percent of Americans control as\nmuch as 33 percent of the assets.\n \nThe most interesting discovery in income inequality is that most\nmillionaires, multimillionaires, and billionaires in America are first\ngeneration. They started with little or nothing and earned all their money by\nthemselves in one lifetime.\n \nIn America, there is a high level of income mobility, which means you\nare able to move from the lower levels of income to the upper levels.\nAlmost everyone who is in the top 20 percent today started in the bottom 20\npercent. From that point, they began to do something different with their\ntime and their lives, and as a result, they put themselves squarely onto the\nupward escalator of financial success."

    "raw_text": "No Limits on Your Potential\n \nThe average income increase in America is about 3 percent a year, just\nabout the same as the rate of inflation and cost of living increases. People\nwhose income is increasing at 3 percent a year seldom get ahead. They have\na job, which can also be thought of as an acronym for “Just Over Broke.”\n \nBut the fact is that no one is better than you, and no one is smarter than\nyou. If someone is doing better than you are today, it is simply proof that he\nhas learned how the Law of Cause and Effect applies to his work, and he\nhas begun doing the things that other successful people have also done. The\napplication of the Law of Cause and Effect to your personal life is “learn\nand do.”\n \nThe achievement of personal excellence is a decision you make—or that\nyou fail to make. But in the absence of a commitment to excellence in your\nchosen field, you automatically default to average performance—or even\nmediocrity. No one becomes excellent accidentally or by just going to work\neach day. Excellence requires a definite decision and a lifelong\ncommitment.\n\f\nThe Keys to the Twenty-First Century\n \nKnowledge and skill are the keys to the twenty-first century. Becoming the\nbest person you can possibly be and moving to the top of your field require\nthe application of self-discipline throughout your life. Mental fitness is like\nphysical fitness: If you want to achieve either, you must work at it all your\nlife. You can never let up. You must be continually learning and growing—\nevery day, week, and month—throughout your career (and in other areas of\nyour life) if you’re going to join the top 20 percent and stay there. To earn\nmore, you must learn more.\n \nAbraham Lincoln once wrote, “The fact that some have become wealthy\nis proof that others may do it as well.”\n \nWhat others have done, you can do as well—if you learn how. Everyone\nwho is at the top was once at the bottom. Many people who come from\naverage or poor families with average incomes or who grow up in average\ncircumstances have gone on to become some of the most prominent people\nin their fields. And what hundreds of thousands and even millions of other\npeople have done, you can do as well. The philosopher Bertrand Russell\nonce wrote that “the very best proof that something can be done is that\nsomeone else has already done it.”\n\f\nOrdinary into Extraordinary\n \nVery often, you see people who don’t seem to be as intelligent or as talented\nas you are who are nonetheless accomplishing remarkable things with their\nlives. There is nothing that will make you angrier than to see someone who\nseems to be dumber than you doing better than you. How can this be?\n \nThe answer is simple: At a certain point in their lives, they realized that\nthe key to success was personal and professional growth. It was a\ndedication to lifelong learning.\n \nThe good news is that almost every important skill is learnable. Every\nbusiness skill is learnable. Everyone who is proficient in any area of\nbusiness was at one time completely ignorant in that area. Every sales skill\nis learnable. Every top salesperson was once a beginning salesperson and\nunable to make a call or close a sale. All moneymaking skills are learnable\nas well. Almost every wealthy person was once poor. You can learn\nanything you need to learn to achieve any goal you can set for yourself."

    "raw_text": "Make a Decision\n \nThe starting point of your moving upward and onward toward becoming\none of the most competent, most respected, and highest paid people in your\nfield is simple: Make a decision!\n \nIt is said that every major change in your life comes about when your\nmind collides with a new idea, and you then make a decision to do\nsomething different. You make a decision to complete your education,\nupgrade your skills, or get into a good college. You make a decision to start\na new business. You make a decision to take a particular job or start a\nparticular career. You make a decision to invest your money in a particular\nway. And, especially, you make a decision to be the best in your field.\n \nMany people say that they would like to be happy, healthy, thin, and\nrich. But (as discussed in Chapter 4), wishing and hoping are not enough.\nYou have to make a firm, unequivocal decision that you are going to pay\nany price and go any distance in order to achieve the goals you have set for\nyourself. You have to make that decision and then burn your mental bridges\nbehind you. From that minute on, you resolve to continue working on\nyourself and your craft until you reach the top 20 percent—or beyond.\n\f\nFollow the Leaders, Not the Followers\n \nWhen you decide to be one of the best people in your field, look around you\nand identify the people who are already at the top:\n• What characteristics do they have in common?\n• How do they plan and organize their days?\n• How do they dress?\n• How do they walk, talk, and behave with other people?\n• What books do they read?\n• How do they spend their spare time?\n• Who do they associate with?\n• What courses have they taken?\n• What audio programs do they listen to in their cars?\n \nThese are just a few of the questions you should ask in order to find out\nwhat successful people are doing that you might also need to do. After all,\nyou can’t hit a target that you can’t see.\n \nYour selection of the right role models can have an enormous impact on\nyour future. Dr. David MacLelland of Harvard and author of The Achieving\nSociety concluded that your choice of a “reference group” can determine as\nmuch as 95 percent of your success and achievement in life. Your reference\ngroup is made of the people who you feel are “just like me.” Your natural\ntendency is to adopt the attitudes, styles of dress, opinions, and lifestyles of\nthe people with whom you identify and associate most of the time.\n \nFLY WITH THE EAGLES\n\f\nSome years ago, one of my seminar participants told me his story. Bob\nBarton said he had started off in his twenties in a large company with\nabout thirty-two salespeople in his branch. It was his first real job, and\nhe was starting at the bottom. Because he was new, he hung around\nwith the other junior salespeople. As they say, “Birds of a feather flock\ntogether.”\n \nAfter a month or two, Bob noticed that the top salespeople in the\noffice also associated with each other. They did not spend time with\nthe junior salespeople. They also spent their time differently. When\nBob got into work in the morning, the top salespeople were already\nthere, planning their days and working on the telephone and making\nappointments. Bob also noticed that the junior salespeople would come\nin later, drink coffee, read the newspaper, and make excuses for not\nmaking sales calls.\n  \n \nLEARN FROM THE BEST\n \nBob decided he was going to pattern himself after the top salespeople\nin the office. He looked at the way they dressed and groomed, and he\nresolved to dress and groom the way they did. Each morning, he would\nstand in front of his mirror and ask himself, “Do I look like one of the\ntop salespeople in my office?”\n \nIf the answer was “no,” he would go back and change his clothes\nuntil he felt that he looked as good as the best people. He began to\ncome into the office and organize his day before 8:30 A.M. so that he\nwas ready to make calls as soon as his customers were available to see\nhim.\n \nOne day, Bob asked one of the top salespeople if he could\nrecommend a book or audio program that would help him. It turns out\n\f\nthat top people are always willing to help other people improve. When\nhe got the recommendation, Bob immediately went out and got the\nbook and sent away for the audio program. He read the book and\nlistened to the program and then reported back to the top salesman.\nThe top salesman gave him some more advice on things to read and\nlisten to, all of which Bob followed.\n  \nDO WHAT THE TOP PEOPLE DO\n \nBob asked another salesperson how he planned his day, and that\nsalesperson showed him his time management system. So Bob began\nto plan and organize his day the way the top salespeople did it. By\nusing these top salespeople as his role models and emulating them\nwhenever possible, Bob started to make more appointments, see more\nprospects, and make more sales. Within six months, he was one of the\ntop salespeople in the office as well.\n \nBy that time, the top salespeople had invited him for coffee and\nlunch, and he became one of them, rather than one of the junior\npeople. The next year, Bob went to the national sales conference,\nwhere he met a lot of the top people from around the country. He\ndeliberately sought them out and asked for their advice: What books\nwould they suggest? What audio programs would they recommend?\nWhat seminars had they attended? What strategies did they find that\nwere the most effective in building their sales business?\n  \nFOLLOW THE ADVICE YOU GET\n \nBob did something that few people ever do: When he received advice,\nhe followed it. He immediately took action on the advice and then\nreported back to the people who had given it to him."

    "raw_text": "Within four years, Bob became one of the top salespeople in the\ncountry. His friends and associates were the other top salespeople in\nhis branch and in the other branches. His income had increased several\ntimes. He wore beautiful clothes, drove a new car, lived in a lovely\nhome, and had a wonderful wife. And he said that it all came about as\na result of asking top people for their input and then following that\ninput and applying it to his sales activities.\n \nBut here’s the kicker: Over and over, the top people, the ones who\nhad been winning the sales awards year after year, told Bob the same\nthing: He was the first person who had ever come up to them and\nasked them for advice. No one else had ever sought them out and\nasked them why they were so successful.\n\f\nThe Answers Have All Been Found\n \nHere is a great discovery: All the answers have been found. All the routes to\nsuccess have been discovered. Everything that you need to learn to move to\nthe top of your field has already been learned by hundreds and even\nthousands of other people. And if you ask them for advice, they will give it\nto you. Successful people will have their phone calls held, cancel other\nappointments, and put their work aside to help other people be successful.\nBut you must ask, and then you must follow their advice once they give it\nto you.\n \nIf you can’t ask them directly, read their books and attend their talks and\nseminars. Listen to audio programs created by successful people.\nSometimes you can send them e-mails and ask for advice. Learn from the\nbest.\n\f\nSet High Income as a Goal\n \nIf your goal is to be in the top 20 percent of money-makers in your field, the\nfirst thing you need to do is find out what the people in the top 20 percent\nare earning today. This information is available. Just ask around. Check\nindustry statistics. Go onto Google. You can find this information if you\nlook for it.\n \nOnce you know the income target at which you are aiming, write it down\nas your goal. Make a plan to achieve this level of income, and work on it\nevery day. Never stop until you reach it.\n \nThe secret to high income in business and sales is quite simple: learn and\ndo. Like jacking up a car, you improve one notch at a time. Each time you\nlearn and practice a new skill, you ratchet up your earning ability—and it\nlocks in. As long as you keep increasing your earning ability, you keep\nratcheting up to a higher level, from which you seldom decline.\n\f\nUse the 3 Percent Formula to Invest in Yourself\n \nTo guarantee your lifelong success, make a decision today to invest 3\npercent of your income back into yourself. This seems to be the magic\nnumber for lifelong learning. According to the American Society for\nTraining and Development, this is the percentage that the most profitable 20\npercent of companies in every industry invest in the training and\ndevelopment of their staff. Decide today to invest 3 percent of your income\ninto yourself in order to make yourself an appreciating asset, to continually\nincrease your earning ability.\n \nIf your annual income goal is $50,000, resolve to invest 3 percent of that\namount, or $1,500, back into yourself each year to maintain and upgrade\nyour knowledge and skills. If your income goal is $100,000, resolve to\ninvest $3,000 per year back into yourself to ensure that you reach that level\nof income.\n \nTHE PAYOFF IS EXTRAORDINARY\n \nI was giving a seminar in Detroit a couple of years ago when a young\nman, about thirty years old, came up to me at the break. He told me\nthat he had first come to my seminar and heard my “3 Percent Rule”\nabout ten years ago. At that time, he had dropped out of college, was\nliving at home, driving an old car, and earning about $20,000 a year as\nan office-to-office salesman.\n \nHe decided after the seminar that he was going to apply the 3\nPercent Rule to himself, and he did so immediately. He calculated 3\n\f\npercent of his income of $20,000 would be $600. He began to buy\nsales books and read them every day. He invested in two audio-\nlearning programs on sales and time management. He took one sales\nseminar. He invested the entire $600 in himself, in learning to become\nbetter.\n \nThat year, his income went from $20,000 to $30,000, an increase of\n50 percent. He said he could trace the increase with great accuracy to\nthe things he had learned and applied from the books he had read and\nthe audio programs he had listened to. So the following year, he\ninvested 3 percent of $30,000, a total of $900, back into himself. That\nyear, his income jumped from $30,000 to $50,000. He began to think,\n“If my income goes up at 50 percent per year by investing 3 percent\nback into myself, what would happen if I invested 5 percent?\n  \n  \nKEEP RAISING THE BAR\n \nThe next year, he invested 5 percent of his income, $2,500, into his\nlearning program. He took more seminars, traveled cross-country to a\nconference, bought more audio- and video-learning programs, and\neven hired a part-time coach. And that year, his income doubled to\n$100,000.\n \nAfter that, like playing Texas Hold-Em, he decided to go “all in”\nand raise his investment into himself to 10 percent per year. He told\nme that he had been doing this every since.\n \nI asked him, “How has investing 10 percent of your income back\ninto yourself affected your income?”\n\f\nHe smiled and said, “I passed a million dollars in personal income\nlast year. And I still invest 10 percent of my income in myself every\nsingle year.”\n \nI said, “That’s a lot of money. How do you manage to spend that\nmuch money on personal development?”\n \nHe said, “It’s hard! I have to start spending money on myself in\nJanuary in order to invest it all by the end of the year. I have an image\ncoach, a sales coach, and a speaking coach. I have a large library in my\nhome with every book, audio program, and video program on sales and\npersonal success I can find. I attend conferences, both nationally and\ninternationally in my field. And my income keeps going up and up\nevery year.”"

    "raw_text": "Three Simple Steps to Become the Best\n \nBecoming one of the top people in your field requires discipline and\napplication more than anything else. There are three simple steps that you\ncan follow to become the very best in your field:\n1. Read sixty minutes in your field each day. Turn off the\ntelevision and the radio, put aside the newspaper, and read material\nabout your field for one hour each day before you start working.\n2. Listen to educational audio programs in your car. Start them\nand stop them as you listen, so you can reflect on what you have just\nheard and think about how you can apply the ideas to your work.\n3. Attend courses and seminars in your field regularly. Seek\nthem out. Take online courses in the convenience of your own home,\ncourses that enable you to upgrade your skills and give you important\nideas that you can use to be even more successful.\n \nThe power of compound learning, like compound interest, is quite\namazing. The more you learn, the more you can learn. The more you learn,\nthe better your brain functions, and the smarter you get. Your memory and\nretention rate improve. The more you learn, the more relationships you find\nbetween something you learned at one time and something you learn at\nanother time.\n \nNever stop learning and growing.\n\f\nThe Achievement of Mastery\n \nHow long does it take to achieve mastery in your field? According to the\nexperts, the acquisition of “mastery” requires about seven years, or 10,000\nhours of hard work. It takes seven years to become a master salesperson. It\ntakes seven years to become a successful businessperson. It takes seven\nyears to become an excellent diesel mechanic. It takes seven years to\nbecome an excellent brain surgeon. It seems to take seven years, or 10,000\nhours of hard work, to get to the top of any field. So you might as well get\nstarted. The time is going to pass anyway.\n \nThe starting point of your achieving mastery is for you to commit to\nexcellence. I have never met a person who made a decision to get into the\ntop 20 percent in their field who did not eventually achieve it. And I never\nmet a person who got there having not made that decision. Making the\ndecision and then following it up with continuous, purposeful, disciplined\naction is essential.\n\f\nTalent Is Not Enough\n \nAs I mentioned earlier, according to Geoffrey Colvin in his bestselling\nbook, Talent Is Overrated, most people learn how to do their job in the first\nyear, and then they never get any better. They just coast in their jobs. But\nthe only direction you can coast is downhill.\n \nMany people will work away at a job for many years and never rise\nabove the average. They will do their job from eight to five, but they never\nlift a finger to upgrade their skills. They will not invest any time learning\ntheir craft unless their company pays for the extra training and gives them\nthe time off to take it.\n \nThe average person does only an average job, and as a result, he earns an\naverage income and worries about money all his life. He never realizes that\noften there is only a thin veil that separates the average person from the\nexcellent person. The fact is that “if you’re not getting better, you’re getting\nworse.” No one stays in the same place for long.\n\f\nTwo Hours Each Day Will Get You to the Top\n \nIt has been calculated that all you need to invest is about two extra hours\nper day to move from the average to the superior. Only two extra hours each\nday will move you from worrying about money all your life to being one of\nthe highest paid people in your field.\n \nPeople immediately ask, “Where am I going to get an extra two hours\neach day?”\n \nIt’s simple: Take a piece of paper and do the following simple\ncalculation:\n• Calculate the number of hours in a week: 7 days times 24 hours\nequals 168 hours.\n• If you deduct forty hours for work and fifty-six hours for sleep,\nyou have seventy-two hours left over.\n• If you deduct three hours per day (twenty-one hours) for getting\nready for and traveling to and from work, that leaves you fifty-one\nhours of spare time to do with as you please.\n• If you invest two hours per day back into yourself, fourteen\nhours per week, you still have thirty-seven hours left over. That’s an\naverage of more than five hours per day of free time.\n \nAll you need to do is devote two hours each day to move you from\naverage performance to superior performance at whatever you choose to do."

    "raw_text": "Form the Habit of Continuous Learning\n \nThe best news is that when you begin reading personal or professional\ndevelopment literature, listening to audio programs in your car, taking\nadditional courses, and upgrading your skills in the evenings and on the\nweekends rather than watching television, you soon get into the habit of\ncontinuous learning. In no time at all, it will become automatic and easy for\nyou to learn, grow, and upgrade your skills every day and every week.\n \nThe average adult watches about five hours of television each day. For\nsome people, it is seven or eight hours. They turn on the television first\nthing in the morning and watch it until they leave for work. They turn it\nback on as soon as they get home from work. They then watch television\nuntil 11 or 12 o’clock at night, going to bed without enough time to get a\ngood night’s sleep. They then get up in the morning, drink coffee, and\nwatch television for as long as they can before they go off to work once\nmore.\n\f\nYou Can Be Rich or Poor: It’s Your Decision\n \nYour television set can make you rich or poor. If you watch it all the time, it\nwill make you poor. Psychologists have shown that the more television you\nwatch, the lower are your levels of energy and self-esteem. At an\nunconscious level, you don’t like or respect yourself as much if you sit there\nhour after hour watching television. People who watch too much television\nalso gain weight and become physically unfit from sitting around too much.\n \nYour television can also make you rich—but only if you turn it off.\nWhen you turn off your television, you free up time that you can then use to\ninvest in becoming a better, smarter, and more competent person. When you\nleave your television off when you are with your family, you will find\nyourself talking, sharing, communicating, and laughing more often. When\nyou leave your television off for extended periods of time, you break the\nhabit of watching television—and you will hardly miss it at all. Your\ntelevision can be an excellent servant, but it’s a terrible master. The choice\nis yours."

    "raw_text": "Increase Your Income 1,000 Percent\n \nThere is a simple seven-step formula you can use in order to increase your\nproductivity, performance, output, and income by 1,000 percent over the\nnext ten years. It works for everyone who tries it. It is simple:\n \nFirst, answer this question: Is it possible for you to increase your overall\nproductivity, performance, and output by 1/10 of 1 percent (1/1000th) in an\nentire working day? Your answer will probably be “yes.” If you were to\nmanage your time a little better, and work on more valuable tasks, you\nwould quite easily increase your output by 1/1000th in a day.\n \nHaving done this for the first day, could you increase your output by 1/10\nof 1 percent the second day? And the answer, of course, is “yes.”\n \nHaving increased your performance by 1/10 of 1 percent on Monday and\nTuesday, could you continue to do it for Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday?\nAnd again, the answer is “yes.”\n\f\nOne Half of 1 Percent Per Week\n \nOne tenth of 1 percent times five days per week equals one half of 1 percent\nper week. Is it possible for a normal, intelligent, hard-working individual to\nincrease his or her output by one half of 1 percent (1/200th) in a single\nweek? Of course it is!\n \nHaving done this for the first week, could you keep up the same pace of\npersonal improvement the second week? Of course you could!\n \nCould you get one one-thousandth of 1 percent better five days a week\nfor an entire month? If you could, this means that you would be one half of\n1 percent better per week multiplied times four, or 2 percent more\nproductive in an entire month.\n \nThere are thirteen four-week months in a year (4 × 13 = 52). Having\nbecome 2 percent better in a month, could you repeat that in the second\nmonth? In the third month? The fourth month? And so on?\n\f\n26 Percent Better Each Year\n \nOf course you could! By working on yourself a little bit each day—learning\nnew skills, getting better at your key tasks, setting priorities, and focusing\non higher-value activities—you can become 26 percent more productive\nover the course of an entire year.\n \nHaving achieved this goal for the first year, could you do it for the second\nyear, and then the third? Could you keep it up for ten years? And the\nanswer, of course, is yes. And the best news is that when you continue to\nwork on yourself, it becomes easier and easier for you to get better and\nbetter as the weeks and months go by.\n \nBy the Law of Accumulation, or the Law of Incremental Improvement,\nby the end of twelve months, you would be 26 percent better. If you\ncontinued to improve at 26 percent per year, by the end of ten years, with\ncompounding, you would be 1,004 percent more productive. Your income\nwould increase at the same rate. This formula works—if you do."

    "raw_text": "Seven Steps to the Top\n \nHere are the seven steps in the 1,000 percent formula:\n  \nStep 1: Arise Two Hours Before Your First Appointment, or before you\nhave to be at work. Invest the first hour in yourself by reading something\neducational, motivational, or spiritual. As Henry Ward Beecher once said,\n“The first hour is the rudder of the day.”\n \nWhen you get up and invest the first hour in yourself, you set yourself up\nmentally to have an excellent day. You will be more positive, alert, creative,\nand productive all day long when you start your day by investing the first\nhour in yourself.\n \nIf you read in your field one hour per day, that will translate into about\none book per week. One book per week will translate into about fifty books\nper year. Since the average adult reads less than one nonfiction book per\nyear, if you were to read fifty books in your field each year, do you think\nthat would give you an edge in your profession? Do you think that it would\nmove you ahead of virtually everyone else in your business? Of course it\nwould!\n \nIf you read fifty books per year for ten years, this would be 500 books\nthat would help you improve your productivity, performance, and income.\nAt the very least, you would need a bigger house just to hold your books.\nAnd you would be able to afford it!"

    "raw_text": "Reading one hour per day in your field will make you a national authority\nin three to five years. This alone can give you your 1,000 percent increase\nover the course of your career.\n  \nStep 2: Rewrite Your Goals, Every Day. Get a spiral notebook and rewrite\nyour major goals in the present tense every morning before you start out,\nwithout looking back at what you wrote the previous day. This writing and\nrewriting is the process of programming instructions into the guidance\nmechanism of your mind.\n \nWhen you rewrite your ten goals each morning, you will continually see\nand think of opportunities to achieve those goals all day long. You will\nbecome more focused, channeled, and directed. You will be more\npurposeful and determined. And you will achieve your goals much faster\nthan if they were merely wishes floating around in the back of your mind.\n \nWriting and rewriting your goals each day can give you your 1,000\npercent increase in income over ten years.\n \nStep 3: Plan Every Day in Advance. Make a list, and set priorities on your\nwork before you start off. Your ability to set priorities and to choose the\nmost important thing that you can be doing at every moment is the key to\norganizing your life and doubling your productivity. (We will talk in detail\nabout time management techniques in Chapter 12.)\n \nWorking on your top priorities can increase your income by 1,000\npercent over ten years, and it is probably impossible to achieve without it.\n  \nStep 4: Discipline Yourself to Concentrate Single-Mindedly on One\nThing. Choose the most important thing that you can do each day. Then,\nstart on it first thing and then work on it until it is 100 percent complete.\n\f\nYour ability to focus and concentrate, when you develop and hone it into a\nhabit, all by itself, will enable you to double your productivity,\nperformance, and output in the next month—and it will give you your 1,000\npercent increase over ten years.\n  \nStep 5: Listen to Educational Audio Programs in Your Car. The average\nbusinessperson who drives spends 500- 1000 hours per year behind the\nwheel of a car. When you turn your car into a “university on wheels” or a\n“mobile classroom,” you get the educational equivalent of one to two full-\ntime university semesters as you drive around.\n \nMany people have gone from rags to riches by simply listening to\neducational audio programs in their cars as they drive from place to place.\nYou could do the same. This alone could give you your 1000 percent\nincrease.\n  \nStep 6: Ask Two Magic Questions After Every Call or Event. First, ask\nyourself, “What did I do right?” Then, ask yourself, “What would I do\ndifferently?”\n \nThe first question, “What did I do right?” forces you to think through and\nrecall all the correct things that you did in that last meeting, presentation, or\nevent, even if it was not successful. Write them down.\n \nThe second question, “What would I do differently?” forces you to think\nthrough all the different ways you could improve your performance in a\nsimilar situation. Write these ideas down as well.\n \nIn both cases, by reviewing your performance, by thinking about what\nyou did right and what you would do differently, you program yourself to\nperform even better the next time. This is one of the fastest and most\n\f\npowerful exercises in personal growth and development I have ever\ndiscovered. This process dramatically speeds up the rate at which you move\ninto the top 20 percent.\n  \nStep 7: Treat Every Person You Meet Like a Million-Dollar Customer.\nTreat each person you meet and work with, both at home and in the office,\nas though he or she is the most important person in the world. When you\ntreat people as if they are valuable and important, they will return the favor\nby treating you as if you are valuable and important as well. They will want\nto be associated with you, work for you, buy from you, and introduce you to\ntheir friends.\n \nYou begin treating people like million-dollar customers by starting at\nhome, with the members of your family. Remember, they are the most\nimportant people in your life. So when you start your day well, first thing in\nthe morning, by making the members of your family feel important and\ntelling them that you love them, you will be more positive, relaxed, and\nhappier for the rest of the day.\n \nFully 85 percent of your success will be determined by how much people\nlike and respect you, especially in business and sales. Never miss an\nopportunity to treat people well.\n \nWhen you practice these seven steps each day for a month, you will see\nchanges and improvements in your life, work, and income that will astonish\nyou. After a month of regular practice, you will have formed a new habit of\ncontinuous personal improvement that can carry you onward and upward\nfor the rest of your life."

    "raw_text": "Chapter 6\n \nSelf-Discipline and Courage\n \n“Courage is not absence of fear; it is control of fear, mastery of fear.”\n—MARK TWAIN\n \n \n \n \nYou need large amounts of self-discipline to deal courageously with all the\nfear-inducing events of your life. This is probably why Churchill said,\n“Courage is rightly considered the foremost of the virtues, for upon it, all\nothers depend.”\n \nThe fact is that everyone is afraid—and usually of many things. This is\nnormal and natural. Often, fear is necessary to preserve life, prevent injury,\nand guard against financial mistakes.\n \nSo if everyone is afraid, what is the difference between the brave person\nand the coward? The only difference is that the brave person disciplines\nhimself to confront, deal with, and act in spite of the fear. In contrast, the\ncoward allows himself to be dominated and controlled by the fear. Someone\nonce said that—with regard to warfare, although it applies to any situation\n—“The difference between the hero and the coward is that the hero sticks in\nthere five minutes longer.”\n\f\nFears Can Be Unlearned\n \nFortunately, all fears are learned; no one is born with fears. Fears can\ntherefore be unlearned by practicing self-discipline repeatedly with regard\nto fear until it goes away.\n \nThe most common fears that we experience, which often sabotage all\nhope for success, are the fears of failure, poverty, and loss of money. These\nfears cause people to avoid risk of any kind and to reject opportunity when\nit is presented to them. They are so afraid of failure that they are almost\nparalyzed when it comes to taking any chances at all.\n \nThere are many other fears that interfere with our happiness. People fear\nthe loss of love or the loss of their jobs and their financial security. People\nfear embarrassment or ridicule. People fear rejection and criticism of any\nkind. People fear the loss of respect or esteem of others. These and many\nother fears hold us back throughout life.\n\f\nFear Paralyzes Action\n \nThe most common reaction in a fear situation is the attitude of, “I can’t!”\nThis is the fear of failure and loss that stops us from taking action. It is\nexperienced physically, starting in the solar plexus. When people are really\nafraid, their mouth and throat go dry, their heart starts pounding. Sometimes\nthey breathe shallowly and their stomach churns. Often they feel like\ngetting up and running to the bathroom.\n \nThese are all physical manifestations of the inhibitive negative habit\npattern, which we all experience from time to time. Whenever a person is in\nthe grip of fear, he feels like a deer caught in the headlights of a car. This\nfear paralyzes action. It often shuts down the brain and causes the\nindividual to revert to the “fight-or-flight” reaction. Fear is a terrible\nemotion that undermines our happiness and can hold us back throughout\nour lives.\n\f\nDo the Opposite\n \nAristotle described courage as the “Golden Mean” between the extremes of\ncowardice and impetuousness. He taught that “to develop a quality that you\nlack, act as if you already had that quality in every situation where it is\ncalled for.” In modern terms, however, we say, “Fake it until you make it.”\n \nYou can actually change your behavior by affirming, visualizing, and\nacting as if you already have the quality you desire. By affirming, by\nrepeating the words, “I can do it!” emphatically whenever you feel afraid\nfor any reason, you can cancel the feeling of “I can’t.”\n \nEvery time you repeat the words “I can do it!” with conviction, you\noverride your fear and increase your confidence. By repeating this\naffirmation over and over again, you can eventually build your courage and\nconfidence to the point where you are unafraid.\n\f\nVisualize Yourself as Unafraid\n \nBy visualizing yourself performing with confidence and competence in an\narea where you are fearful, your visual image will eventually be accepted\nby your subconscious mind as instructions for your performance. Your self-\nimage, the way you see yourself and think about yourself, is eventually\naltered by feeding your mind these positive mental pictures of yourself\nperforming at your best.\n \nBy using the “act as if” method, you walk, talk, and carry yourself\nexactly as you would if you were completely unafraid in a particular\nsituation. You stand up straight, smile, move quickly and confidently, and in\nevery respect act as if you already had the courage that you desire.\n \nThe Law of Reversibility says that “if you feel a certain way, you will act\nin a manner consistent with that feeling.” But if you act in a manner\nconsistent with that feeling, even if you don’t feel it, the Law of\nReversibility will create the feeling that is consistent with your actions.\n \nThis is one of the greatest breakthroughs in success psychology. You\ndevelop the courage you desire by disciplining yourself repeatedly to do the\nthing you fear until that fear eventually disappears—and it will.\n \nBLOW AWAY THE FEAR\n \nWhen I work with sales organizations, they often ask me how to help a\nsalesperson break out of a sales slump, especially in a tough economy."

    "raw_text": "I give them a simple formula that is guaranteed to work, every single\ntime. It is called the “100-Call Method.” In practicing this method, I\ninstruct the salesperson to go out and call on one hundred prospects as\nfast as he can, without caring at all whether or not he makes a sale.\n \nWhen the salesperson doesn’t care if he makes a sale, his fear of\nrejection largely disappears. He stops caring if the prospect he is\nspeaking to is interested or not interested. He has a single focus. It is to\nmake one hundred calls as fast as he possibly can.\n \nOne sales organization I work with has a daily prize for the first\nsalesperson who gets rejected ten times each morning. At 8:30 A.M.,\nall the salespeople sit down at their desks and start making calls to try\nto win the prize. By the time the contest is over, usually by 10 A.M.,\neveryone’s fears of rejection have been blown out of their systems.\nThey’re ready to call on prospects all day long, not caring at all about\nthe reactions they get.\n\f\nLearn to Speak on Your Feet\n \nIn 1923, Toastmasters International was formed. Its express purpose was to\ntake people who were terrified of public speaking and help them to become\nconfident and competent when speaking on their feet in front of an\naudience.\n \nAccording to The Book of Lists, 54 percent of adults rate the fear of\npublic speaking ahead of the fear of death. But Toastmasters International\nhad a solution. They created a system based on what psychologists call\n“systematic desensitization.”\n \nOnce a week, at a luncheon or dinner meeting, small groups of\nToastmasters come together. Each person is required to stand up and give a\nshort talk on a specified subject in front of a group of his peers. At the end\nof each talk, the speaker receives applause, positive input, and comments\nfrom the other members. At the end of the evening, each person is given a\ngrade on his talk, even if it was only for thirty or sixty seconds.\n \nAfter six months of attending Toastmaster’s meetings, the individual will\nhave stood on his feet and spoken twenty-six times, receiving positive\napplause and feedback each time. Because of this continuous positive\nreinforcement, his confidence increases dramatically. As a result of this\nprocess, countless Toastmasters have gone on to become excellent public\nspeakers and prominent people in their businesses, organizations, and\ncommunities. Their fears of public speaking are gone forever.\n\f\nEliminate Two Fears at Once\n \nPsychologists have found that certain fears are bundled together in the\nsubconscious mind, like wires on the same circuit. If you can overcome\nyour fears in one of these areas, you will also eliminate other fears on the\nsame circuit.\n \nThe fear of rejection, or call reluctance, seems to be bundled together\nwith the fear of public speaking. When you discipline yourself to join\nToastmasters or take a Dale Carnegie course to learn to speak confidently\non your feet, your fears of rejection disappear as well. Your level of self-\nconfidence in all your interactions with others increases dramatically. Your\nwhole life changes in a positive way.\n\f\nConfront Your Fears\n \nYour ability to confront, deal with, and act in spite of your fears is the key\nto happiness and success. One of the best exercises you can practice is to\nidentify a person or situation in your life of which you are afraid and\nresolve to deal with that fear situation immediately. Do not allow it to make\nyou unhappy for another minute. Resolve to confront the situation or person\nand put the fear behind you.\n \nA woman in one of my seminars told me that her boss was a very\nnegative person. He was constantly criticizing and berating her about\nher work, even though she was one of the highest-rated employees in\nthe organization. He was making her life miserable. She didn’t want to\ngive up her job, but she was afraid of confronting him. She asked me\nwhat she should do.\n \nI gave her this advice, which I have subsequently given to many\nother people: The only reason that one person bullies another is he\nfeels he can get away with it. The only way to deal with a bully is to\nconfront him. Bullies are actually cowards at heart, and they will flee\nfrom a confrontation.\n \nI told her to do this: The next time your boss criticizes you for any\nreason, turn to him and say, quite firmly, “I would appreciate if you not\ntalk to me like that ever again. It hurts my feelings and stops me from\ndoing my job the way you want.”\n\f\nI told her to look him straight in the eye after she had finished\nmaking this statement. She had tremendous courage. Rather than\nputting up with this situation any longer, the next time her boss began\nto berate her, she squared off with him and said those words.\n \nShe wrote to me and told me what had happened. Just as I had\npredicted, he stopped dead in his tracks. He immediately apologized\nand mumbled and then quickly went back to his office. He never\ncriticized her again. She told me that she could have ended his bad\ntreatment of her many months before if she had only had the courage\nto confront him directly the first time it happened.\n \nAs Eleanor Roosevelt said, “No one can make you feel inferior\nwithout your consent.”\n\f\nMove Toward the Fear\n \nWhen you identify a fear and discipline yourself to move toward it, it grows\nsmaller and more manageable. What’s more, as your fears grow smaller,\nyour confidence grows. Soon, your fears lose their control over you.\n \nIn contrast, when you back away from a fear-inducing situation or\nperson, your fear grows larger and larger. Soon it dominates your thinking\nand feeling, preoccupies you during the day, and often keeps you awake at\nnight.\n\f\nLeaders Have Two Types of Courage\n \nIn leadership, the most common quality is that of vision. Leaders have a\nclear vision of where they want to take their organizations. Leaders also\nhave a clear vision of where they want to be sometime in the future in their\npersonal lives.\n \nThe second most common quality of leaders is that of courage. Leaders\nhave the courage to do whatever is necessary to fulfill their vision. They\nlead from the front and dare to go forward.\n \nThere are two types of courage that you need:\n \nFirst, you need the courage to launch, to take action, to take a leap of\nfaith. You need the courage to go “all in” without any guarantee of success\nand with a high possibility of failure, at least in the short term. The major\nfailing that holds most people back is that in spite of all their best\nintentions, they don’t have the courage to take the first step.\n \nThe second type of courage that you need is called “courageous\npatience.” This is the ability to hang in there and continue working and\nfighting after you have gone all in and before you have yet seen any results\nor rewards. Many people can muster up the courage to take action toward a\nnew goal, but when they see no immediate result they quickly lose heart\nand pull back to safety and security. They don’t have staying power."

    "raw_text": "Deal With the Fear Directly\n \nThe only way to deal with a fear is to address it head-on. Remind yourself\nthat “denial” is not a river in Egypt. The natural tendency of many people is\nto deny that they have a problem caused by fear of some kind. They’re\nafraid of confronting it. In turn, it becomes a major source of stress,\nunhappiness, and psychosomatic illness.\n \nBe willing to deal with the situation or person directly. As Shakespeare\nsaid, “Take arms against a sea of troubles, and in so doing, end them.”\n \nThe companion of fear is worry. Like twin sisters, fear and worry go\naround together. Mark Twain once wrote, “I have worried about a lot of\nthings in life, and most of them never happened.”\n \nIt has been estimated that 99 percent of the things that you worry about\nnever happen. And most of the things that do happen, happen so quickly\nthat you didn’t have time to worry about them in the first place."

    "raw_text": "The Disaster Report\n \nWhenever you are worried about something, fill out a “Disaster Report” on\nthe situation. This will destroy your fear and worry almost instantly. This is\noften called the “worry buster.” The Disaster Report has four parts:\n• First, Define the Worry Situation Clearly. What exactly are you\nworried about? Very often, when you take the time to be completely\nclear about the worry situation, a way to resolve the situation becomes\nimmediately evident.\n• Second, Identify the Worst Possible Thing That Could Possibly\nHappen if this worry situation were to take place. Would you lose your\njob? Would you lose your relationship? Would you lose your money?\nWhat is the worst thing that could possibly happen? Be clear about\nthis. In many cases, you will see that should the worst occur, it would\nnot ruin you. It might be inconvenient or uncomfortable, but you\nwould eventually recover. You will find that it’s probably not worth all\nthe worry that you are devoting to it.\n• Third, Resolve to Accept the Worst Possible Outcome, should it\noccur. Say to yourself, “Well, if that happens, it won’t kill me. I will\nfind a way to get along.” Most of the stress of worry comes from\ndenial, from not being willing to face the worst possible thing that\ncould happen. But once you have resolved to accept the worst (should\nit occur), all the worry and stress seem to disappear.\n• Fourth, Begin Immediately to Improve on the Worst. Take\nevery step that you possibly can to make sure that the worst possible\noutcome does not occur. Take action immediately. Do something. Get\non with it. Act quickly. Get so busy making sure that the worst thing\ndoes not happen that you have no time to worry.\n\f\nThe Real Antidote\n \nIn the final analysis, the only real cure for fear or worry is disciplined,\npurposeful action in the direction of your goals. Get so busy working on\nyour goals or the solutions to your problems that you have no time to be\nafraid or to worry about anything.\n \nWhen you practice the self-discipline of courage and force yourself to\nface any fear-inducing situation in your life, your self-esteem goes up, your\nself-respect increases, and your sense of personal pride grows. You\neventually reach the point in life where you are not afraid of anything.\n \nOnce you have developed the courage to step out in faith, you must then\ndevelop the self-discipline of persistence , which we will talk about in the\nnext chapter.\n  \nAction Exercises:\n 1. Identify your three biggest fears in life, right now. What\nare they?\n2. Determine what you would do in each of these situations\nif you were guaranteed of complete success. What actions would\nyou take?\n3. What have you always wanted to do but been afraid to\nattempt? What would you do differently if you were guaranteed\nsuccess?\n\f\n4. In what three areas of life and work do you most\nexperience the fears of failure and loss? What steps could you\ntake immediately to confront and eliminate those fears?\n5. In what three areas of life do you most experience the\nfears of criticism, rejection, or embarrassment? How could you\nconfront these fears and overcome them?\n6.

    "raw_text": "Chapter 7\n \nSelf-Discipline and Persistence\n \n“Beware of endeavoring to become a great man in a hurry. One such\nattempt in 10,000 may succeed. These are fearful odds.”\n—BENJAMIN DISRAELI\n \n \n \n \nPersistence is self-discipline in action. Your ability to persist in the face of\nall setbacks and temporary failures is essential to success in life.\n \nNapoleon Hill said, “Persistence is to the character of man as carbon is to\nsteel.” The primary reason for success is persistence, and, likewise, the\nprimary reason for failure is lack of persistence, quitting too soon.\n \nThere is a direct link between self-discipline and self-esteem. Each time\nyou discipline yourself to do what you should do, when you should do it,\nwhether you feel like it or not, your self-esteem increases. This why there is\ndirect relationship between self-esteem and persistence. Each time you\npersist and force yourself to continue on, even when you feel like quitting,\nyour self-esteem goes up.\n \nEach act of self-discipline strengthens every other act of self-discipline.\nEvery act of persistence strengthens every other act of persistence. When\nyou discipline yourself to persist, over and over, you like and respect\n\f\nyourself more and more. You become stronger and more confident.\nEventually, you become unstoppable.\n\f\nThe Reward of Persistence\n \nPersistence is its own reward. Every time you force yourself to persist on a\ntask, whether it is large or small, you feel happier and better about yourself.\n \nWhen you go the extra mile and do more than you are paid for or more\nthan is expected, your self-esteem goes up. You feel more powerful and in\ngreater control of your life. In your career, when you go the extra mile you\nput yourself on the side of the angels. The primary difference between\nwinners and losers in life is simple: Winners never quit, and quitters never\nwin.\n \nYou can increase your ability to persist by talking to yourself positively.\nSay these words: “I am unstoppable!” Before you begin any major\nundertaking, preprogram yourself by telling yourself, “I never give up.”\n \nBefore you can achieve anything worthwhile in life, you have to pass\n“the persistence test.” This is usually a “snap quiz” sprung on you\nunexpectedly with no warning. You suddenly face a major setback,\nproblem, temporary failure, or even a complete disaster. When this happens,\nremind yourself that this is the “testing time.” This is when you demonstrate\nwhat you are really made of. This is when you show yourself and others the\nstrength of your character and your true determination to succeed.\n\f\nYour Ability to Respond\n \nYour ability to respond effectively to setbacks—your level of “response-\nability”—is the measure of your readiness to succeed. When you experience\na major setback or problem, you will feel temporarily stunned. This feeling\nis very much like a punch in the emotional solar plexus. You will be\nstopped for a few seconds or a few minutes. During this period, you will\noften feel discouraged or experience self-pity. You will say, “Why me?”\n \nHowever, it is not how far you fall that counts, but rather how high you\nbounce. Your aim is to bounce back as quickly as possible. Resilience in the\nface of unexpected reversals is vital to long-term success. Remember the\nwarrior’s creed: “I will lay me down to bleed awhile, and then rise and fight\nagain.”\n \nDon’t be surprised, shocked, or set back when things go wrong. Your\nbest-laid plans will often fall apart. Instead, expect disappointments and\nsetbacks as a part of life. Take a deep breath, pick up the pieces, and\ncontinue onward."

This is a boundless confidence in yourself and your ability to\nultimately succeed. To remain optimistic, you must control and discipline\nyour thinking when things go wrong. Refuse to feel sorry for yourself.\nRemember, you are not a victim. You are an adult, and you are in charge of\nyour own life. You are doing what you have freely chosen to do.

When you complain or blame\nother people, it just makes you feel and sound petty and small, and, what’s\nworse, it takes away your personal power. Whenever you criticize or\ncomplain, it makes you feel weaker and reduces your ability to deal\neffectively with the situation. Instead, greet every setback by repeating, “I\nam responsible.”\n \nLook for the reasons why you are responsible for what happened rather\nthan trying to pass off the blame onto other people. No excuses.\n\f\nBe Proactive Versus Reactive\n \nResolve to focus on the solution and what can be done now, rather than on\nwhat happened and who’s to blame. Think in terms of the actions you can\ntake to resolve the situation rather than what went wrong and who is to\nblame.\n \nTo remain optimistic, look for the good in every situation. When you\nlook for something good, you will always find something good.\nFurthermore, while you’re looking for something good, because your\nconscious mind can hold only one thought at a time, you will automatically\nbecome positive, optimistic, and back in full control.\n \nSeek the valuable lesson in every problem or difficulty. Every setback\nyou face contains one or more lessons that have been sent to you to help\nyou be more successful in the future. The difference between successes and\nfailures is simple: Failures feel sorry for themselves when things go wrong,\nwhereas successful people look for the valuable lesson they can learn that\nwill help them in the future.\n\f\nLook for the Gift\n \nNormal Vincent Peale used to say, “When God wants to send you a gift, he\nwraps it up in a problem. The bigger the gift that God wants to send you,\nthe bigger the problem he wraps it up in.”\n \nInstead of concentrating on the problem, look for the gift. Wonderfully\nenough, you will always find it. What’s more, sometimes the gift, or\nvaluable lesson, can be of far greater value than the cost of the problem\nitself. Sometimes, one lesson that you learn in dealing with a problem can\nbe the key to your long-term success. As Napoleon Hill wrote, “Within\nevery problem or obstacle lays the seed of an equal or greater opportunity\nor benefit. Your job is to find it.”\n \nContinually think of yourself as a strong, powerful, resolute person in the\nface of adversity. In World War I, a British general was described by his\nsuperiors: “There he stands, like an iron peg, driven into the frozen ground,\nimmovable.”\n \nLet this be an accurate description of you whenever you face difficulties\nor problems of any kind. Resolve to stand like an iron peg driven into the\nfrozen ground."

    "raw_text": "Chapter 8\n \nSelf-Discipline and Work\n \n“Leaders aren’t born; they are made. And they are made just like\nanything else, through hard work. And that’s the price we’ll have to\npay to achieve that goal, or any goal.”\n—VINCE LOMBARDI\n \n \n \n \nThere is perhaps no area of your life where self-discipline has a greater\nimpact on your future than in your work. Yet, if you’re like most people,\nfrom the time you start in the morning and then continuing throughout the\nday, you are surrounded by people and events that draw you away from\ndoing the things that are most important. However, it is through doing your\nmost important tasks that you move onward and upward, quickly and\ndependably in your career.\n \nA group of senior executives was asked, “What are the most important\nqualities that a person would need to be promoted in your company?” Of\nthese executives, 85 percent agreed that the most important qualities are\n1. The ability to set priorities and work on high-value tasks; and\n2. The discipline to get the job done quickly and well.\n \nIt seems that these two qualities are more helpful for career success than\nanything else a person can do. Diligent, disciplined, focused work will\n\f\nenable you to consistently and predictably get more done, get paid more,\nand get promoted faster throughout your career than the average person.\n\f\nSeparate the Relevant from the Irrelevant\n \nI’ve mentioned the Pareto Principle—the 80/20 rule—several times in this\nbook, and it applies again here. Fully 80 percent of the value of what you\naccomplish will come from 20 percent of the things you do. Your job, then,\nis to identify those top 20 percent of your tasks and then concentrate single-\nmindedly on doing them quickly and well.\n \nChapter 13 discusses time management in detail, but for now, let’s take a\nlook at the flip side of good time management—poor time management.\nAccording to Robert Half International, the average employee wastes about\n50 percent of his or her time on nonwork-related activities:\n• Thirty-seven percent of work time is wasted on idle\nconversation on personal subjects with coworkers, conversations that\nhave nothing whatsoever to do with the job at hand.\n• The other 13 percent of wasted time is consumed by coming in\nlate or leaving early, by long lunches and coffee breaks, by surfing the\nInternet, reading the newspaper, or conducting personal business\nduring the day.\n \nEven worse, when people who waste a lot of time actually settle down\nand get to work, they spend too much time on low-value tasks and\nactivities. As a result, they get very little done, which then causes them to\nfeel that they are under continual pressure to get caught up.\n \nUnfortunately, when you waste time at work, your work does not go\naway. It continually builds, like an avalanche overhang. Deadlines come\n\f\ncloser and closer. Stress mounts up until you finally force yourself to do the\njob, usually at the last minute, and then you often make expensive mistakes."

    "raw_text": "Develop an Excellent Reputation\n \nThere is nothing that will bring you more quickly to the attention of people\nwho can help you than for you to develop a reputation for hard, disciplined\nwork, every hour of every day.\n \nAverage employees increase their income at only about 3 percent per\nyear, which is just about the rate of inflation or cost-of-living increases. In\nother words, if you’re an average employee, you’re not really making any\nmore money from year to year. Rather, you’re just keeping up with your\nexpenses. But the top 20 percent in most fields increase their income\nanywhere from 10 to 25 percent per year—which is also compounded, year\nafter year.\n \nThe top 20 percent of people at work earn 80 percent of the money. The\nbottom 80 percent of employees have no choice but to share the 20 percent\nof the money that is left over. They must scramble for the crumbs that fall\noff the tables of the highly productive people in their fields.\n \nYOU CAN DOUBLE YOUR INCOME!\n \nWhen I say to people in my seminars that you should set a goal to\n“double your income” in the months and years ahead, people react in\ndifferent ways. Often, at the break, someone will come up to me and\nsay, “You don’t understand my company. There is no way that I could\ndouble my income at my current company. They simply would not pay\nme that amount of money.”\n\f\nHaving heard this before, I then ask them the critical question: “Is\nthere anyone at your company who earns twice as much as you?”\n \nThe person who I am talking to will always agree that, “Yes, there\nare people in my company who earn two or three times as much as I\ndo.”\n \nI then make the key point, “So your company is quite willing to pay\nsome people twice as much as they pay you. They’re just not willing to\npay you twice as much. Why is that?”\n \nThen suddenly the light goes on. This individual realizes that it is\nnot the company that is not willing to pay the money. It is the\nindividual who is not contributing enough to be worth that additional\nmoney. The responsibility is his, not the company’s.\n\f\nThe Law of Three Helps You Prioritize\n \nWhen we coach entrepreneurs, executives, and business owners, we take\nthem through an exercise that is designed to help them double their\nproductivity, performance, and output within twelve months—sometimes,\neven, within thirty days. It’s simple. Here’s how it works.\n \nFirst, make a list of all the things that you do in a week or a month, from\nthe time you start work on Monday morning through to the end of the week.\nWrite everything down, both small and large, including checking your e-\nmail and returning phone calls.\n \nThen, review this list and ask this key question:\n“If I could do only one thing on this list, all day long, which one task\nor activity contributes the most value to my company?”\n   \nAs you go over your list, the correct answer will probably jump out at\nyou. Whatever it is, put a circle around it.\n \nThen ask the second question:\n“If I could do only two things on this list, all day long, which would be\nthe second task or activity?”\n\f\nReview your list again, and identify your second most important task in\nterms of contribution to your company.\n \nFinally, ask the question once more:\n“If I could do only three things on this list, all day long, what would be\nthe third item?”\n   \nWe call this the “Law of Three.” The Law of Three says that there are\nthree primary things you do that contribute 90 percent or more of your\nvalue to your company or organization. Your job is to identify those three\ncritical tasks and then discipline yourself to do them all day long. All of\nyour other minor tasks will be support tasks, complementary tasks,\nenjoyable tasks, or useless tasks. They will be little things that you have\noften gotten into the habit of doing as a way of unconsciously avoiding the\nbig, difficult, important tasks that can make a tremendous difference in your\nwork and career."

    "raw_text": "Calculate Your Hourly Rate\n \nAnother way for you to double your income is for you to use the “hourly\nrate” method of calculating your personal value and your time allocation.\nFirst, determine the amount that you earn each hour. You do this by dividing\nyour annual income by the number 2,000 (which is the roughly the number\nof hours that an entrepreneur or executive works each year in our society:\n40 hours a week × 50 weeks a year).\n \nFor example, if you earn $50,000 a year, divided by 2,000, your hourly\nrate would be $25. If you earn $100,000 per year, divided by 2,000, your\nhourly rate would be $50.\n \nWhatever it is, from that moment onward, resolve to do only those things\nthat pay you your hourly rate or better. Refuse to do those things that\nsomeone else can do at a lower hourly rate than you. Do not waste your\ntime doing things of low value or no value while your other important tasks\nare building up.\n\f\nGet on the Same Page About What Work Is Most Important\n \nOnce you have made a list of all the results you feel you have been hired to\naccomplish and you have determined the three most important things you\ndo to justify your hourly rate, take your list of key activities to your boss\nand have your boss organize your job based on his or her priorities. You\nneed to do this because you must be sure.\n \nBenjamin Tregoe, cofounder of the Kepner-Tregoe consulting firm and\nauthor of The Rational Manager, once said, “The very worst use of time is\nto do very well what need not be done at all.”\n \nYet it is amazing how many people are working hard on tasks that are of\nlittle or no value to their bosses. No matter how well you do an\nunimportant task, it does not help you. Even worse, working on low-value\ntasks keeps you from working on the most important things you could be\ndoing. Hard work on the wrong job can actually sabotage your career.\n \nThe happiest days you will have at work will be when you are working\non those tasks that your boss considers to be most important. The\nunhappiest days at work will be when you and your boss are at cross-\npurposes and not getting along primarily because you are not completing\nthe jobs that are most important to him and to his career.\n \nYour goal is to be paid more and promoted faster. Your goal is to become\none of the most valuable and highest paid people in your field. Your job is\nfirst, to make yourself valuable, and then to make yourself indispensable to\n\f\nyour company. This requires first and foremost that you are always working\non those tasks your boss considers most important."

    "raw_text": "Work All the Time You Work\n \nThe key to doubling your productivity and output—and eventually your\nincome—is to really work all the time you are at work. Simply put, when\nyou work, work. Don’t waste time. Don’t delay. Don’t chat with coworkers\nor sit around drinking coffee. Don’t read the newspaper or surf the Internet.\nWhen you come into work in the morning, put your head down, and then\nwork all day long.\n \nThe biggest time wasters in the world of work are other people who want\nto talk with you, distract you, delay you, and take up the time that you\nshould be spending on high-value tasks. When a time waster approaches\nyou and says, “Do you have a minute to talk?” you reply by saying, “Yes,\nbut not now. Why don’t we talk at lunchtime, or after work? In the\nmeantime, I have to get this job finished. I have to get back to work.”\n \nWhen you tell people that you are under the gun, that you have to get a\ntask finished for your boss, they will usually leave you alone. If you do this\noften enough, they will develop the habit of leaving you alone and, instead,\nfind someone else with whom to waste time.\n \nKeep yourself motivated and focused by talking to yourself in a positive\nway. Your mantra from now on should be, “Back to work! Back to work!\nBack to work!”\n \nWhenever you find yourself slowing down on a major task, begin\nrepeating to yourself those magic words, “Back to work!”\n\f\nWho Works Hardest? The Secret Survey\n \nImagine that an outside company is going to do a study of all the people\nwho work in your organization. They are going to give each person a list of\nall the employees and ask him to rate his fellow employees in terms of who\nworks the hardest, the second hardest, and so on.\n \nThey are then going to give this list of people, organized from the hardest\nworker down to the laziest, to your superiors. This list is going to be used to\ndetermine who gets paid more and promoted faster than others.\n \nNow, imagine that this survey is already being taken, but in secret. The\nfact is, in any organization, everyone knows who works harder than anyone\nelse. Everyone knows who works less and who does not pull his weight.\nEveryone knows—it’s not a secret at all.\n \nResolve today that, if a survey like this were to be taken, one year from\ntoday, you would “win” the contest. Resolve today that you are going to\ndevelop the reputation for being the hardest-working person in your\nbusiness. This will do more to help you than almost anything else.\n \nWhen you are surrounded by time-wasting people and situations, it takes\ntremendous self-discipline to work all the time you are at work. You must\nconstantly fight against distractions and interruptions so you can get back to\nwork.\n \nTHE SUCCESS FORMULA\n\f\nWhen I began my career working for a large company, I was the low\nman on the totem pole. Everyone had been there longer than me and\nwas ahead of me in the company pecking order. Even though I was in\nmy early thirties, I still had no idea how to play the game or what to do\nto get ahead in the cutthroat, corporate competition that existed.\n \nSomewhat by accident, I stumbled onto the formula that made me\nsuccessful. It was simple. Whenever my boss gave me something to\ndo, I did it immediately. Like a dog chasing after a thrown stick, I\nwould immediately throw myself at the task, complete it, and hurry\nback to my boss with the finished job.\n \nInitially, he would smile and say something like, “I didn’t really\nneed it that quickly, but thank you for getting it done.”\n  \n \nASK FOR MORE RESPONSIBILITY\n \nWhen I was caught up with my work, instead of relaxing, I would go\nto my boss and say, “I’m all caught up. I want more work to do. I want\nmore responsibility.” These words became my mantra: “I want more\nresponsibility.”\n \nAgain my boss, who was preoccupied with an enormous number of\nprojects, would say something like, “Okay, leave it with me; I’ll think\nabout what else I can give you to do.”\n \nEvery day, like a broken record, I would go to my boss at the end of\nthe day and say, “I’m all caught up; I would like more responsibility.”\n\f\nBit by bit, he began to toss me “sticks.” He would give me a little\ntask to do to keep me busy. Whatever it was, I would go out\nimmediately, complete the task, and bring him the results. I would then\nsay, “I’m all caught up. I want more responsibility.”\n \nWithin six months, he began to see me as the “go-to guy.”\nWhenever he had something he needed done quickly, he passed by\neveryone else and gave it to me. He knew that whatever he asked me\nto do, I would do it quickly.\n  \nTIME IS OF THE ESSENCE\n \nOnce, my boss asked me to fly to Reno to begin development work on\na property that the company was purchasing. He told me I could go\nsometime in the next couple of weeks. Instead, I left the next morning.\nI went straight to the lawyer who was handling the transaction and\nthen to the engineer who was in charge of the development work. I\nimmediately sensed that something was seriously wrong with this land\npurchase. I didn’t know what it was, but I went from person to person,\nasking questions and gathering information.\n \nBy the end of the day, just a few hours before this $2 million\ntransaction was set to close and the money would change hands\nforever, I found that we were about to be sold a piece of land that had\nno water and was therefore undevelopable. Because of complex laws\nand limited riparian rights (i.e., water rights), the property was a\nworthless piece of ground that could not be developed within the next\nhundred years. If we had proceeded with the purchase, we would have\nlost $2 million!\n \nI immediately stopped the transaction, demanded that the lawyer cut\nme a certified check for the $250,000 deposit that was in his trust\n\f\naccount, and flew home to my boss to tell him the story. As you can\nimagine, my boss was very happy with what I had done.\n  \nTHE BIG PAYOFF\n \nFrom that day forward, I received more and more responsibilities.\nWithin another year, I was running three divisions of the company and\nhad a staff of forty-two people in three cities. I later learned that my\nboss paid me more money than anyone else who had ever worked for\nhim, and he did so all on the basis of results and profitability.\n \nThis is why whenever people ask me how to succeed in business by\nreally trying, I give them the same advice: Whatever your boss gives you to\ndo, do it quickly and well. Then, go and ask for more responsibility. And\nwhen you get it, do the job quickly and well until you get a reputation for\nbeing the person who does things fast. This will help you advance in your\ncareer more than any other reputation you could develop.\n\f\nPay the Price\n \nHere is a simple three-part formula for success at work: Come in a little\nearlier, work a little harder, and stay a little later. This will move you so\nfar ahead of your competitors that they will never catch up.\n \nCome into work one hour earlier, before anyone else arrives. Use that\ntime to plan and organize your day and get started on your most important\ntasks. Make sure that whatever time your boss comes to work, you are\nalways there working before he arrives.\n \nSecond, work a little harder. Don’t waste time. Don’t chat with\ncoworkers. Work through lunchtime so that you can get on top—and stay\non top—of your main tasks and responsibilities.\n \nThird, work one hour later than your coworkers. If they leave at five\no’clock, you leave at six. Use that extra time to complete your important\ntasks and get yourself organized for the following day.\n \nWhen you come in one hour earlier, work through lunch, and work one\nhour later, you add three full productive hours to your day. Because there\nare no interruptions when you work during these time periods, you will\nactually accomplish two or three times as much as you would during your\nother work hours, when you are constantly interrupted by other people and\ntelephone calls.\n\f\nIn fact, you can double or even triple your productivity, performance, and\noutput by simply adding these three hours to your workday. The best news\nis that by coming in earlier and leaving later, you don’t lose anything. You\nmerely avoid the traffic tie-ups and slow-downs that most people suffer\nthrough on their ways to and from work."

    "raw_text": "The Forty Plus Formula\n \nTo succeed faster at work, use the “Forty Plus Formula.” This formula says\nthat you can tell where you are going to be five years from now by looking\nat the number of hours that you put in today in excess of forty hours each\nweek.\n \nIf all you do is put in the regular forty hours that everyone else puts in, all\nyou will do is survive. Your annual increases will be 3 or 4 percent. You\nwill have a “job,” but your income increases will go up at the same rate as\neveryone else.\n \nIt is when you put in more than forty hours that you give yourself an\nadvantage over most of the other people in your company—and your\nbusiness. Make it a habit to do more than what you are paid for. Discipline\nyourself to put in more than you take out. Every hour that you work over\nforty hours a week is an investment in your future success.\n \nThe highest paid people in America, in every field, work fifty to sixty\nhours per week. The average self-made millionaire works fifty-nine hours\nper week. This is equal to five twelve-hour days or six ten-hour days. Most\nsuccessful people, at the beginning of their careers, worked six days a week\n—sometimes seven. Moreover, they worked all the time they were at work.\nThey didn’t waste time. They realized that in order to reap a great harvest\nlater in their career, they had to sow a lot of seeds in the springtime of their\ncareer.\n\f\nLook the Part: Dress for Success\n \nFinally, you need to discipline yourself to look the part. Remember, “birds\nof a feather flock together.” When it comes to presentation, this means that\npeople like to promote others who look like them. Your bosses are very\nsensitive to the appearance of their staff. They like to promote people who\nthey are proud to introduce to their friends and colleagues. Be sure that you\ndress and groom in such a way that your boss would be proud to take you\nout for lunch and introduce you to others as a representative of his or her\ncompany.\n \nEach morning before you go to work, look in the mirror and ask yourself,\n“Do I look like one of the top people in my field?” If you don’t, go back\nand change—and keep changing until you look like one of the top people in\nyour business.\n \nLearn how to dress for success. Read books and articles, or ask others for\nadvice. Look at the most successful people in your business and dress the\nway they do. Dress for the job two levels above your current job.\nRemember that fully 95 percent of the first impression you make on other\npeople will be determined by your dress and grooming. Make sure that first\nimpression—and then the second and third impressions—are consistent\nwith the message you want to send.\n \nMany people work their entire lives without realizing that by putting\nforward a little extra effort, working a little harder, and focusing on higher-\nvalue tasks, they could become one of the most valuable people in their\norganizations.

    "raw_text": "Chapter 9\n \nSelf-Discipline and Leadership\n \n“Nothing is more harmful to the service than the neglect of discipline;\nfor it is discipline more than numbers that gives one army superiority\nover another.”\n—GEORGE WASHINGTON\n \n \n \n \nLeadership and self-discipline go hand in hand. It is not possible to imagine\nan effective leader who lacks self-discipline, willpower, self-control, and\nself-mastery. The overarching characteristic of a leader is that he is in\ncomplete control of himself and of every situation.\n \nThere has seldom been a time in history when leaders were so needed\nand so much in demand as today. We need leaders at every level of society,\nboth in the profit and nonprofit sectors. We need leaders in our families,\nbusinesses, places of worship, community organizations, and, especially,\npolitics. We need men and women who take their responsibilities seriously\nand are willing to step forward to take command of the situation.\n \nFortunately, leadership is learnable. Leaders are developed—usually\nself-developed—over time through hard work, experience, and training. As\nPeter Drucker once said, “There may be natural-born leaders, but there are\nso few of them, that they make no difference in the great scheme of things.”"

    "raw_text": "Four Stages of Development\n \nIn your career in business, you progress through four levels of activity and\nattainment. First, you start off as an employee, with limited knowledge and\nexperience. Then, as you grow, learn, and develop the ability to get results,\nyou evolve upward and become a supervisor, with responsibility for the\nperformance and results of other people.\n \nAs you continue to move up the scale of supervision, improving your\nability to get things done through others from directly overseeing the work\nof employees, you become a manager, someone who assigns work to\npeople with demonstrated competence in certain areas. Managers have a\nlarger view, and this comes with greater responsibilities.\n \nAs you move up the scale of management, becoming more\nknowledgeable and effective and getting more and better results from more\nand different people, you reach the highest level, that of a leader. At this\nstage, you are responsible for determining what is to be done rather than\nhow it is to be done.\n \nIt is said that “some leaders are made, some are born, and some people\nhave leadership thrust upon them.” Leaders emerge or are promoted to deal\nwith a situation requiring leadership ability. In its simplest terms, the role of\nthe leader is to “take responsibility for results.”\n \nThe primary reason that people are promoted into increasingly higher\nlevels of leadership is that they demonstrate the ability to get the required\n\f\nresults at each level. The ongoing question of the leader is always, “What\nresults are expected of me?” Clarity is essential.\n \nThe main reason that some people are not promoted into greater\nleadership position—or perhaps they are even fired—is because of “failure\nto execute.” They do not do the most important jobs expected of them, nor\ndo they get the results demanded of them."

    "raw_text": "Leaders Have Vision\n \nThe first quality of leadership, based on 3,300 studies of leaders done by\nJames MacPherson, is the quality of vision . Leaders have vision. They\nhave the ability to project forward into the future and develop a clear\npicture of where they want their organizations to go. They then have the\nability to share this vision with others and gain others’ commitment to make\nthis vision a reality.\n \nYou become a leader when you accept responsibility for results. You\nbecome a leader when you begin to think, act, and talk like a leader. You\nbecome a leader when you develop a vision for yourself and for your\ncompany, your life, or your area of responsibility.\n \nThere are hundreds of books written about leadership and the importance\nof vision. Yet they can be boiled down to a single principle. A military\nleader has a vision of victory , from which he never deviates. A business\nleader has a vision of success for the business based on excellent\nperformance, to which he or she is completely committed.\n\f\nA Leader Is a Standard Bearer\n \nThe leader sets the standard for the organization. It is not possible for\nanyone in the organization to have a clearer vision or to aspire to a higher\nstandard of excellence than the leader. For this reason, the leader is the role\nmodel, the one who sets the tone and the morale for everyone in the\norganization. The personality and influence of the leader affect everyone\nbelow him in the company, organization, or department.\n \nYou cannot raise morale in a business; it filters down from the top, from\nthe leader. The behavior of the leader influences and affects the behavior of\neveryone else. If the leader is positive, confident, and upbeat, everyone in\nthe organization will be influenced by this behavior and will be more\npositive, confident, and upbeat as well.\n\f\nWalk the Talk\n \nWhen you become a leader, you must discipline yourself to be “leaderlike.”\nYou must walk, talk, and act the part of a leader. You become a different\nperson with different responsibilities.\n \nWhen you are working your way up, you are a part of the staff or the\nsales team. When you become a manager, you are part of management. This\nmeans that when you are part of the staff, your orientation is upward and\nsideways, but when you become a leader, your orientation is downward,\ntoward all the people for whom you are responsible.\n \nPerhaps the most important behavior of a leader is for you to discipline\nyourself to be a role model. Imagine that everyone is watching you and\npatterning everything they do and say based on your behavior.\n \nWhen you become a leader you no longer have the luxury to “let it all\nhang out.” From the time you are promoted into leadership, you have a\nspecial responsibility to discipline and control your words and behaviors in\nsuch a way so that you bring about the best possible results for your\norganization and for other people.\n\f\nSet the Standards\n \nThe leader sets the standards for the organization’s behavior, quality of\nwork, personal organization, time management, and appearance. In\nexcellent organizations, the leader is the person who everyone looks up to\nand wants to emulate.\n \nIn most cases, the leader works harder than others in the company. The\nleader appears to be more committed, determined, courageous, visionary,\nand persistent than anyone else. The leader sets a tone that everyone wants\nto emulate.\n \nThe leader also sets the standard for how people are treated in the\norganization. When the leader treats people with courtesy, consideration,\nand concern, it quickly becomes known that these are the standards to\nwhich others must adhere.\n\f\nSet Values and Principles\n \nIn addition to a clear vision for the organization, the leader must have a set\nof values and organizing principles that guide behavior and decision\nmaking. Everyone must know what the leader and the company stand for\nand believe in. The job of the leader, then, is to articulate this vision of\nexcellent performance within the constraints of high ethical standards at all\ntimes. He or she must walk the talk and live the values and behaviors he or\nshe teaches.\n \nThe very best standard for a leader is the Golden Rule: “Do unto others\nas you would have them do unto you.”\n \nFor example, when Jack Welch was the president of General Electric,\nhe encouraged managers to treat each employee as if that employee\nmight be promoted over his head sometime in the future and he might\nfind himself working under the person who is now working below\nhim. This way of thinking ensured that managers treated their staff\nwith a high degree of respect and courtesy.\n\f\nSeven Principles of Leadership\n \nTo be an effective leader, there are seven principles you must incorporate\ninto your leadership behavior and activities.\n 1. Clarity: This is perhaps your most important responsibility.\nYou must be absolutely clear about who you are and what you stand\nfor. You must be absolutely clear about your vision and where you\nwant to lead your people. You must be absolutely clear about the goals\nand objectives of the organization and how they are to be obtained.\nEspecially, you must be absolutely clear about the values, mission,\nand purpose of the organization and what it stands for. Everyone\naround you and below you must know exactly why they are doing\nwhat they do and what their company has been formed to accomplish.\n 2. Competence: As the leader, you must set a standard of\nexcellent performance for the organization as well as for every person\nand function in the company. Your goal must be for your company to\nbe as good as, or better than, your very best competitor. You must be\ncontinually seeking ways to improve the quality of your products and\nservices to your customers.\n3. Commitment: The leader is absolutely committed to the\nsuccess of the organization and believes completely that this\norganization is the best in the business or will be the best in the future.\nThis passionate commitment to the organization—and to success and\nachievement—motivates and inspires people to do their best work and\nput their whole hearts into their jobs.\n4. Constraints: The job of the leader is to identify the constraints\nor limiting factors that set the speed at which the company achieves its\nmost important goals of revenue and profitability. The leader then\n\f\nallocates people and resources to alleviate those constraints and\nremove the obstacles so it can perform as one of the best in the\nindustry.\n5. Creativity: The leader is open to new ideas of all kinds and\nfrom all sources. The leader is continually encouraging people to find\nfaster, better, cheaper, and easier ways to produce excellent products\nand services and to take better care of customers.\n6. Continuous Learning: The leader is personally committed to\nreading, listening, and upgrading his or her personal knowledge and\nskills as an executive. The leader should attend additional seminars\nand courses to improve his or her skills and abilities.\nAt the same time, the leader encourages everyone in the\norganization to learn and grow as a normal and natural part of business\nlife. The leader provides time and resources for training and\ndevelopment. The leader knows that the best companies have the best-\ntrained people. The second-best companies have the second-best\ntrained people. And the third-best companies have the least-trained\npeople—and are on their way out of business.\n 7. Consistency: The leader has the self-discipline to be consistent,\ndependable, reliable, calm, and predictable in all situations. One of the\ngreat comforts of business life is for an employee to know that the\nleader is completely consistent and reliable. An effective leader does\nnot change from day to day. The leader is not “blown in the wind” by\neach new situation, problem, or emergency that arises. Instead, the\nleader is calm, positive, and confident—especially under pressure."

    "raw_text": "The Inevitable Crisis\n \nThe only thing that is inevitable in the life of the leader is the crisis. When\nyou rise to a position of leadership, you will experience crises repeatedly—\ncrises that are unpredictable, unbidden, and often capable of seriously\ndamaging the organization.\n \nIt is in the crisis that the leader demonstrates his competence. In times of\ncrisis, the leader becomes calm, cool, objective, and completely in control.\nThe leader asks questions and gathers information. The leader assesses the\nsituation accurately and makes whatever decisions are necessary to\nminimize the damage or cut the losses.\n \nGreat leaders discipline themselves to keep their fears and misgivings\nprivate. They do not share their concerns with their staffs, knowing that this\ncan cause confusion and loss of morale. Instead, the leader asks a lot of\nquestions, probes deeply into situations so that he or she understands them\nthoroughly, and keeps his or her feelings private.\n \nAs far as the members of the organization are concerned, the leader is\nalways calm, positive, relaxed, and in complete control—no matter what is\nhappening.\n\f\nSelf-Control and Leadership\n \nThere is a direct relationship between your ability to discipline yourself and\nyour behaviors and your readiness to lead. It is only when you prove to\nothers that you are in complete control of yourself that they develop the\nconfidence to put you in a leadership position—and keep you there.\n \nThe leader realizes that everything he says to or about another person is\nmagnified. The leader therefore praises and encourages people, both in their\npresence and when they are not around. He never says anything negative\nthat could be misinterpreted or that could demotivate or offend another\nperson. If he has problems with someone, he addresses him privately, out of\nsight and earshot of anyone else.\n\f\nLeadership Qualities\n \nLeaders discipline themselves to plan, prepare, organize, and check every\ndetail. They take nothing for granted. They ask questions to ensure that they\nhave a complete understanding of a situation, problem, or difficulty.\n \nGreat leaders act as if they own the entire company. They accept a high\nlevel of personal responsibility. The leader never complains, makes\nexcuses, or blames others for problems.\n \nLeaders are intensely action-oriented. They gather information carefully\nand make the decisions that are necessary. They set measures and standards\nand hold others to them. They insist that the job be done quickly and well.\n\f\nLeaders Rise to the Top\n \nLeaders rise to the top of an organization, as cream rises in milk. When you\naccept complete responsibility for getting results, concentrate single-\nmindedly on completing your most important tasks, continually upgrade\nyour knowledge and skills as well as your ability to contribute value to your\ncompany, and treat other people with kindness and consideration, you will\nemerge as a natural leader.\n \nAs you demonstrate your ability to make an increasingly valuable\ncontribution to your organization, people above, below, and on both sides of\nyou will want you to be promoted into leadership and will support you\nwhen you reach that position. One of your primary aims in life is to walk,\ntalk, act, speak, and treat others as a leader would. Eventually, your position\nwill be equal to your performance.\n \nIn the next chapter, you will learn how to develop and practice the\ndisciplines necessary to be more successful in your business life and\nactivities.\n  \nAction Exercises:\n 1. Ask yourself, “What results are expected of me?” and then\nconcentrate single-mindedly on getting those results every day.\n2. See yourself as the leader of your organization and ask\nyourself, “What kind of a company would this company be if\neveryone in it were just like me?”\n\f\n3. Create a clear, exciting vision for yourself and your\norganization based on success and excellent performance.\n4. Identify the most important people in your business world\nand determine how you will have to behave toward them to get\nthem to perform at their best.\n5. Resolve in advance that, when the inevitable crisis occurs,\nyou will respond in a calm, controlled, and intelligent manner.\n6. Clarify the exact values and principles you believe in and\nstand for, and then share them with the people around you.\n7. Treat each person around you as if he is competent,\nvaluable, and important. This is the key to gaining the loyalty and\ncommitment that you require as a leader."

    "raw_text": "Chapter 10\n \nSelf-Discipline and Business\n \n“The quality of self denial in the pursuit of a longer term goal, and\nindeed, the willpower to maintain that level of self denial, is an\nexcellent training for the boardroom.”\n—JOHN VINEY\n \n \n \n \nMost people will work in or for a business or own a business in the course\nof their lifetimes. The achievement of business success demands high levels\nof discipline from you in every area of business activity, both large or small.\nWithout self-discipline and self-control in business, no success is possible.\n \nThere is no area of activity that demands more self-discipline than\nstarting and operating a successful business in our current economy.\n \nThe first law of economics is scarcity. As a rule, there is never enough of\nanything for everyone who wants it. Specifically, there are never enough\ncustomers for you to sell everything you want to sell. There are never\nenough sales revenues to help you achieve all your financial goals. There\nare never sufficient profits to enable you to expand as much as you want.\nEspecially, there are never enough good people to work with and for you to\nhelp you achieve your business goals.\n\f\nThe Law of Competition\n \nIf the first law of economics is scarcity, then the first law of business is\ncompetition. It requires tremendous focus and discipline to do the things\nnecessary to attract the scarce money of customers toward purchasing your\nproduct or service.\n \nTo not only survive but also thrive, you must compete continually against\nall other uses of the same amount of money that you want to charge for\nwhat you sell.\n \nThe first discipline of business success is that you offer a product or\nservice that people want, need, and will pay for at a price they will accept—\na price that is competitive with every other business that wants the same\ncustomer dollar.\n \nYou must be completely honest with your product/ service mix to ensure\nthat it is well suited to the current market. This is an area where false\nassumptions or incorrect conclusions can lead to business failure. This\nanswer is continually changing as competition and customer tastes also\nchange."

    "raw_text": "The Customer Is Always Right\n \nEvery week, I speak to business people who are unhappy with their level of\nsales and profitability. They insist that their product or service is excellent\nand that people should be buying from them in much larger quantities. In\neach case, I have to gently point out to them that the only proof that their\nproduct or service is truly attractive or valuable is that people buy it\nwillingly—and then buy it again and tell their friends to buy it as well.\n \nAccording to the experts, fully 70 percent of your business decisions will\nturn out to be wrong in the fullness of time. This is the average. When you\nare a new business - person or starting a new business, you will be wrong\neven more often than this. It is not unusual for an entrepreneur to be wrong\n90 percent of the time in the beginning of his career.\n \nIt requires tremendous self-discipline and character to face the possibility\nthat you could be wrong in your most cherished assumptions and beliefs.\nNonetheless, this discipline is essential if you are going to minimize your\nmistakes, cut your losses, and redirect your resources toward offering\ncustomers more of the things that they really want, need, and are willing to\npay for today.\n \nAll business investment and business start-ups require a high level of\noptimism. You must believe in the future possibilities of your business\nalong with your new products and services. You must have so much\nconfidence in their marketability that you are willing to undertake financial\nrisk and invest many hours, weeks, and even years to achieve your business\ngoals, and you must do all this with no real guarantee of success.\n\f\nAt the same time, you need discipline to curb your confidence, to remain\nobjective and realistic. Overconfidence in business can lead to business\nmistakes, financial losses, and even bankruptcy.\n\f\nYou Must Be Better\n \nBecause of the aggressive and determined nature of your competition, in\norder to simply survive, you must discipline yourself to be equal to or better\nthan your competitors. After all, your competitors get out of bed every\nmorning thinking about how they can put you out of business. They want to\ntake away your customers and your sales. They want to get your profits.\nThey want as much of your business as they can possibly get. To increase\nyour probabilities of success against such competition, you must make\nevery effort to out-think them.\n \nWhen you start a business or a new venture within a business, you\nrequire the discipline to do your homework thoroughly, in advance. You\ncreate a complete business plan before you start operations, and you\ncontinue to update it and revise it every year thereafter. The discipline of\nadvanced planning can spell the difference between success and failure.\n\f\nChallenge Your Assumptions\n \nMost business ideas do not work, at least in their original form. As Peter\nDrucker said, “Errant assumptions lie at the root of every failure.” A major\nreason for business failure is that business owners or executives rely on\nassumptions that are not tested. They assume that the product or service is\nexcellent in comparison with others. They assume that they can sell a\nsufficient number of those products or services—and do so at a profit. They\nfurther assume that those profits will be substantial enough to make this\ninvestment of time and money more attractive than any other use of the\nsame amount of time or funds. All of these assumptions must be tested\ncarefully before any irrevocable commitment is made.\n \nAccording to the Kaufman Foundation on Entrepreneurship, 95 percent\nof entrepreneurs and small business owners in America earn less than\n$50,000 per year. Why is this? It is not because they lack the energy,\nintelligence, or ability to earn more. The very fact that a person has the\ncourage and resourcefulness to start a new business means that he or she\nhas above-average levels of natural talent.\n \nThe reason why so many entrepreneurs underachieve and fail is that they\nlack discipline. They lack the discipline to carefully study every aspect of\nthe business before committing to it. They lack the discipline to test their\nassumptions rather than jumping to conclusions and hoping for the best.\nDon’t let this happen to you.\n\f\nIdentify Your Ideal Customer\n \nYou need discipline to identify and determine your ideal customer: the exact\nperson who can and will buy your product or service in sufficient quantities\nand at the price you need to charge in order to justify going into this area of\nbusiness in the first place.\n \nYou need the discipline—based on trial, error, and persistence—to\ndevelop a marketing plan that generates a steady and predictable stream of\nnew leads for your business. To market effectively, you must be clear about\nyour competitive advantage and your unique selling proposition: What is it\nabout your product or service that makes it superior and more valuable for a\ncustomer than any other similar product or service being offered today?\n \nYou need the discipline to develop a complete sales system, from\nbeginning to end, that converts qualified leads into solid customers. It is\namazing how many businesses just assume that the product or service will\nsell itself—whether they have a superior sales system or not!\n\f\nKnow Your True Costs\n \nYou need the discipline to determine accurate costs and the proper pricing\nof your products and services. Wal-Mart has become the biggest retailer in\nhistory largely because of its expertise in this area. It’s amazing how many\nbusinesses are selling products and services at a loss because they have\nnever accurately totaled all the costs of bringing that product or service to\nmarket in the first place. You’ve heard the old saying, “We lose money on\nevery item we sell, but we try to make it up on the volume.” Obviously,\nthat’s not possible!\n \nYou need a quality control system in order to ensure that every product or\nservice that you sell is of such high quality that your customers are so\nsatisfied that they happily buy from you again—and tell their friends.\n \nYou need the discipline to develop a customer service policy, one in\nwhich you treat your customers so well that they become loyal to you and\nchoose you over any of your competitors.\n\f\nThe Purpose of a Business Is to Please Its Customers\n \nWhat is the purpose of a business? The purpose of a business is to create\nand keep a customer in a cost-effective manner. Profits are not the purpose\nof a business. Profits are the result of creating and keeping a sufficient\nnumber of customers who yield a sufficient number of profits after all\ncosts.\n \nWhat is the key measure of business success? The answer is customer\nsatisfaction. Every effort and activity of your business must be aimed at\nsatisfying customers in a manner that is better than any other competitor.\n \nWhat is the measure of customer satisfaction? The answer is repeat\nbusiness. It is only when customers buy from you again that you\ndemonstrate that you have fulfilled the promise you made to them when\nyou got them to purchase the first time. A resale to a satisfied customer\nrequires one tenth of the time and expense as a sale to a brand new\ncustomer. All successful businesses rely on repeat business, which is\npossible only with high levels of customer satisfaction. This is a real\ndiscipline.\n \nWhat is the key to long-term profitability? The answer is\nrecommendations and referrals.\n \nThe ultimate question that determines the long-term success or failure of\nyour business is, “Based on your experience with us, would you\nrecommend us to others?”\n\f\nYou can survive and thrive only when the majority of your customers are\nso happy with your products and services that they will encourage their\nfriends and associates to buy from you as well. Since a referral from a\nsatisfied customer is fifteen times easier to sell to than a cold call (which\nmeans it costs only one fifteenth as much), referral business is the key to\nyour future. You require tremendous focus and discipline to develop and\nmaintain customer service policies that cause people to buy from you, then\nbuy again, and then recommend you to their friends.\n\f\nSet High Standards\n \nYou require the discipline to set standards of excellent performance in every\narea of your business and then to continually strive to get even better. You\nneed to practice the CANEI Formula, which stands for, “Continuous and\nNever-Ending Improvement.” No matter how high your level of quality is\ntoday, you can never be satisfied. You must continually be raising the bar on\nyourself—and on everyone within your area of responsibility.\n \nYou require the self-discipline to work long, hard hours for many months\nand even years to get to the top in your business. The average entrepreneur,\nbusiness owner, or self-made millionaire in American works fifty-nine\nhours per week. Some entrepreneurs even work seventy to eighty hours per\nweek in the first few years of building their businesses. You must be\nprepared to discipline yourself to put in this amount of time and level of\nhard work if you want to be the best and get to the top of your field.\n\f\nThink About the Solution\n \nTo succeed in business, you need the self-discipline to be proactive rather\nthan reactive. You need to focus on solutions rather than problems. You\nneed to concentrate on the most important thing you could possibly be\ndoing every hour of every day rather than getting sidetracked by low-value\nor no-value tasks and activities.\n \nAbove all, you need the self-discipline to settle in for the long term, to\ndevelop a long-time perspective in your business life. Because of the\nintensity of competition, it takes many years of disciplined effort for you to\nbecome a business success, whether this is in your own business or working\nfor someone else. There are no shortcuts. There are no easy ways to get to\nthe top. There is only one way, and that is through hard work, discipline,\nand willpower.\n \nOn average, it takes about two years to break even in a new business\nventure. It takes another two years of positive cash flow to pay back the\nmoney you borrowed in the first two years. It then takes another three years\nbefore you become truly successful. In addition, everything costs twice as\nmuch and takes three times as long.\n \nBased on these statistics, why should you start your own business or\nembark on a new business venture? Because the time is going to pass\nanyway! After all, five years from now you will be five years older, and ten\nyears from now, you will be ten years older. At the end of that time, you\nwill either be at the top of your field or still down among the 80 percent"

    "raw_text": "Business Success or Failure\n \nThousands of bankrupt or insolvent companies have been analyzed over the\nyears to determine why they failed. After all the data was sorted and\nstudied, virtually every business failure came down to one reason: “low\nsales.” In contrast, whenever a business was succeeding, growing, yielding\nprofitability, increasing its share prices, and offering opportunity for more\nand more people, the reason boiled down to one factor: “high sales.”\nEverything else was secondary.\n \nAlmost everything you do in a business either increases or decreases\nsales. Everything either helps or hurts. Everything either attracts and keeps\nmore customers—or drives them away. Everything counts when it comes to\nsales.\n\f\nThe Discipline of Generating Sales\n \nWhether you are a salesperson or a business owner, you require the self-\ndiscipline to focus and concentrate on generating sales every hour of every\nbusiness day.\n \nA group of researchers interviewed several hundred senior executives\nand business owners and asked them, “How important are sales and\nmarketing to your business?”\n \nWithout exception, they all replied, “Sales and marketing are absolutely\nessential to our survival and growth.”\n \nThe researchers then conducted a time-and-motion study of these same\nbusiness owners and executives, following them around and tracking their\ntime usage over the course of a month. At the end of that time, they\ncompleted their calculations and determined that the average business\nowner or executive—who professed that sales were “absolutely essential”\nto survival and growth—was spending only 11 percent of his time on sales\nand marketing. The remaining time was spent on meetings, discussions,\npaperwork, administrative work, luncheons, and a variety of other activities\nthat contributed nothing to sales generation.\n \nIf you are a sales manager or business owner, you must discipline\nyourself to focus most of your time and attention on getting your\nsalespeople to generate the sales on which your company depends. You\nmust spend 75 percent of your time working with your salespeople and\naccompanying them when they visit your customers to make presentations\n\f\nand sales. Do your paperwork before or after work, but during working\nhours, when customers are available to be seen, you should dedicate\nyourself entirely to sales generation.\n \nHOW TO GO BROKE\n \nSome years ago, I started a new business. I developed the product and\nthen began advertising via direct mail, radio, television, and\nnewspaper. I allowed myself to become completely overwhelmed with\nplanning, paperwork, and advertising activities. By the end of the year,\nI was out of money, and my business was almost broke.\n \nAt that time, I realized that I had taken my eye off the ball of sales. I\nthen sat down over Christmas and designed a complete sales process.\nOn January 2nd, I picked up the telephone and began making\nappointments. Over the next two months of aggressive and focused\nsales activity, I did more business than I had done over the entire\nprevious year. I saved my business—and my home—and I never lost\nsight of that focus again.\n  \nOne of the most important questions you can ask as a salesperson,\nentrepreneur, or business owner is whether what you’re doing right now is\nleading to a sale. Ask this question of yourself repeatedly throughout the\nday. Every time the answer comes up “no,” you must immediately stop\nwhatever you are doing of lower value and turn your attention to sales\ngeneration. In addition, make sure that all the people who are responsible\nfor sales in your company ask and answer this question in the affirmative all\nday long."

    "raw_text": "Overcome Your Fear of Rejection\n \nAssuming that you have an attractive product or service, one that is\nreasonably priced and suited to the current market, the biggest problem that\ntelephone salespeople and outside salespeople face is rejection. The fear of\nrejection does more to sabotage a sales career and undermine sales activities\nthan any other single factor. It is the major obstacle to sales success.\n \nIt takes tremendous discipline for salespeople to get up every morning\nand go out and face the inevitable rejection that they know they are going to\nreceive all day long. Most people cannot handle this continuous rejection.\nTherefore, to avoid the emotional pain that comes with rejection, many\nsalespeople engage in a series of “displacement” activities to avoid being\nrejected.\n \nFirst of all, they make fewer calls. According to Columbia University, the\naverage salesperson works about ninety minutes per day—in other words,\nonly about one and a half hours out of an eight-hour day. He spends the rest\nof the time warming up and getting ready, shuffling paperwork, checking\nthe Internet, reading the newspaper, chatting with coworkers, coming in\nlate, leaving early, and taking extended lunches and coffee breaks. As a\nresult, by the end of the day, on average, the salesperson has worked only\nninety minutes.\n\f\nIncrease Face Time with Customers and Prospects\n \nWhen is a salesperson working? The salesperson is working only when he\nor she is ear to ear (on the phone) or face to face with someone who can and\nwill buy within a reasonable period of time.\n \nThe rule for sales success can be contained in six words: “Spend more\ntime with better prospects.” There is no other way to generate a high,\nconsistent, and predictable level of sales results.\n \nBecause of the fear of rejection, however, salespeople procrastinate and\ndelay throughout the sales day, doing everything possible to avoid getting\nface to face with people who can say “no!”\n \nThe key to sales success, as I learned as a young salesman, is to realize\nthat rejection is not personal. Prospective customers always say things like,\n“No, I’m not interested” or variations of, “I don’t want it,” “I don’t need it,”\n“I can’t use it,” “I can’t afford it,” “I’m not in the market right now,” or\n“I’m happy with my existing supplier.”\n \nThe professional salesperson realizes that these are simply normal and\nnatural responses to any commercial offer in a competitive marketplace.\nAgain, they are not personal—so don’t take them personally.\n\f\nRemain Positive and Optimistic\n \nThe key to sales success is to eliminate the fear of rejection, to become so\nconfident and optimistic that you can call continually all day long and still\nremain positive and cheerful. As Winston Churchill said, “Success is the\nability to go from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm.”\n \nThere is a direct relationship between the number of new customer\ncontacts you make and your level of sales. If you want to increase the\nnumber of sales, simply discipline yourself to call on more prospects.\n \nWhen you increase your levels of sales activity, you also activate the Law\nof Probabilities to work on your behalf. You tap into the law of averages.\nYou “work the numbers” to ensure success."

    "raw_text": "How to Double Your Sales Income\n \nPractice the “Minutes Principle” in your sales work. This principle says\nthat, if you are earning all the money that you are earning today with only\nthe number of minutes you are spending face to face with customers today,\nby increasing that number of minutes, you can also increase your sales.\n \nWith outside salespeople, we encourage them to double the number of\nminutes they spend face to face with customers. We teach them to use every\nbit of intelligence and creativity they have to increase the amount of time\nthey spend talking in person with prospects rather than following the path\nof least resistance and allowing themselves to procrastinate getting out into\nthe marketplace.\n \nIn almost every case, when a salesperson doubles the number of minutes\nthat he or she spends face to face or ear to ear with customers, that\nsalesperson’s sales double as well. This is not an accident. It is based on\nlaw: the Law of Probabilities.\n\f\nControl Your Sales Activities\n \nYou can seldom tell where your next sale is going to come from. Therefore,\nyou have to “cast a wide net” and speak to as many prospective customers\nas possible.\n \nThe actual sale itself is not under your direct control. It is controlled by a\nvariety of factors about which you can do very little. But the activities that\nlead to sales are completely under your control. The rule is “Do what you\ncan with what you have right where you are.”\n \nTo achieve high levels of sales success, you must discipline yourself to\nplan your days and weeks in advance. You must discipline yourself to plan\nyour sales activities—especially your prospecting activities—every single\nday, and then you have to discipline yourself to follow through on your\nplans and resolutions.\n\f\nImprove Your Ratios\n \nThere are certain ratios in selling that largely determine how many sales\nyou make. These ratios vary depending on your level of experience and\nability, the competition, the prices of your products or services, and the\ngeneral market. Nonetheless, these ratios always exist:\n• There is a direct ratio between the number of cold calls you\nmake and the number of prospective customers that you will be able to\ntalk to or visit.\n• There is a direct ratio between the number of prospective\ncustomers that you see or talk to and the number of prospects that you\ncan follow up on.\n• There is a direct ratio between the number of people you follow\nup on with proposals and presentations and the number of sales that\nyou close.\n \nYou can also think of this as a “sales funnel”:\n• Into the funnel—i.e., the broad end—go your prospects.\n• The second part of your funnel is your presentations.\n• The third part is where you follow up and close the sale.\n\f\nKeys to Sales Success\n \nYou have two responsibilities when it comes to achieving success in sales:\n1. First of all, keep your funnel full. Always have more\nprospects to call on than you have time during the day. Never let your\nfunnel become empty. Never run out of prospects.\n2. Second, get better at each stage of selling. Study, read, listen\nto audio programs, and upgrade your skills in prospecting, presenting,\nand closing sales. The better you get, the fewer prospects you require\nin the top of the funnel to generate sales out of the bottom of the\nfunnel.\n\f\nStart Early\n \nDiscipline yourself to make your first call early in the morning, by 7:00 or\n8:00 A.M. When you start your day with a face-to-face sales call, you will\nbe more energized and motivated to continue selling all day long.\n \nDiscipline yourself to cluster your calls in a small geo - graphical area so\nthat you can get face to face with more people in a shorter amount of time.\nMany salespeople, because of their fear of rejection, spread their calls out\nover a large geographical area and then convince themselves that they are\nactually working when they are really simply driving from call to call.\n \nRemember: You are working only when you are ear to ear or face to face\nwith someone who can and will buy within a reasonable period of time. At\nall other times, you are “unemployed.”\n\f\nSet Higher Standards for Yourself\n \nDiscipline yourself to act every minute of the day as if everyone were\nwatching you. Outside salespeople require a higher level of discipline than\npeople who work in the office where everyone can see them. Because\nsalespeople are on their own, like guerilla fighters in the sales jungle, the\ntemptation is never ending to slack off, to take it easy, or to go for coffee or\nlunch rather than to make sales calls.\n \nTo perform at your best, you must discipline yourself to work throughout\nthe day—as though your sales manager was doing a “ride-along.” Imagine\nthat your sales manager is sitting next to you all day long. How would you\nwork differently if someone were accompanying you and observing\neverything you did throughout the day? Whatever your answer, that is how\nyou should work—even when no one else is around.\n\f\nAll Sales Skills Are Learnable\n \nTo become one of the highest paid salespeople in your industry, you must\ndiscipline yourself to practice continuous personal and professional\ndevelopment. Read in your field every day. Listen to educational audio\nprograms in your car as you drive along. Attend every sales seminar you\ncan, whether sponsored by your company or not. Dedicate yourself to\ncontinuous learning as if your future depends on it—because it does.\n \nThe turning point in my life when I was a young salesman—frustrated\nand unhappy, going in circles, and barely making a living—was when I\nlearned the Law of Cause and Effect. I learned that “if you do what the most\nsuccessful salespeople do, over and over, there is nothing that can stop you\nfrom eventually achieving the same results and rewards that they do.”\n \nI learned that every salesperson in the top 10 percent started in the\nbottom 10 percent. Everyone who is doing well today was at one time doing\npoorly. Every person at the top of your field was at one time not in your\nfield at all and did not know that it existed.\n \nI learned that all sales skills are learnable. You can learn any sales skill\nyou need to learn to achieve any sales goal you can set for yourself. There\nare no limits except the limits you place on yourself with your own\nthinking.\n \nWhen you discipline yourself to become one of the top salespeople in\nyour field, you will find that you will have turned an important corner in\nyour career. Most salespeople do only what they have to do to keep their"

    "raw_text": "Chapter 12\n \nSelf-Discipline and Money\n \n“In reading the lives of great men, I found that the first victory they\nwon was over themselves; self discipline with all of them came first.”\n—HARRY S. TRUMAN\n \n \n \n \nAccording to insurance industry statistics, of one hundred people who start\nwork at age twenty-one, by age sixty-five, one will be rich, four will be\nfinancially independent, fifteen will have some money put aside, and the\nother eighty will be still working, broke, dependent on pensions, or dead.\n \nMost baby boomers today are planning to work into their seventies. Why\nis this? It is because they don’t have enough money put aside so they can\nstop working.\n \nThe primary reason for financial problems in life is lack of self-\ndiscipline, self-mastery, and self-control. It is the inability to delay\ngratification in the short term. It is the tendency for people to spend\neverything they earn and a little more besides, usually supplemented by\nloans and credit card debt.\n \nToday, the savings rate in America is too low to achieve financial\nindependence. After a lifetime of work, the average American family has a\n\f\nnet worth of only about $8,000. People continue to spend and borrow as if\nthere is no tomorrow.\n \nThe good news is that we are living in the most affluent time in all of\nhuman history. There are more opportunities to achieve wealth and\nprosperity today for more people and in more different ways than have ever\nexisted in the history of man. It has never been more possible for you to\nachieve financial independence than right now. But you must make a\nresolution to do it, and then you must follow through on your resolution.\n\f\nThe Reasons for Financial Failure\n \nThe primary reason why most adults have financial problems is not low\nearnings. In their book The Millionaire Next Door, Thomas Stanley and\nWilliam Danko show that two families living on the same street, in the\nsame size of house, and working at the same job can have completely\ndifferent financial situations. By the age of forty-five or fifty, the couple in\none house will be financially independent while the couple next door is\ndeeply in debt and having trouble making the minimum payments on their\ncredit cards.\n \nThe reason for this is not the amount of money that they earn. The reason\nis lack of self-discipline and the inability to delay gratification. Why is this\nweakness of character so prevalent among the majority of adults in society\ntoday? It goes back to early childhood.\n \nWhen you were a child and you received money (whether it was your\nallowance or a gift from a friend or relative), the first thing you thought of\ndoing was to spend that money on candy. Candy is sweet. Candy is\ndelicious. Candy fills your mouth with a wonderful, sugary flavor. You\nliked candy when you were a child, and you probably could seldom get\nenough of it. Many children will eat candy until they become physically ill\nbecause it tastes so good.\n \nAs you grew older, you developed what psychologists call a “conditioned\nresponse” to receiving money from any source. Like Pavlov’s dog, when\nyou receive money, you mentally salivate at the thought of spending this\nmoney on something that makes you happy, at least temporarily.\n\f\n\n\f\nSpending Makes You Happy\n \nWhen you become an adult and you earn or receive money, this automatic\nreaction continues. Your first thought is, “How can I spend this money to\nachieve immediate pleasure?”\n \nWhen you get your first job, the very first thing you think about is how\nyou can spend not only the money you earn, but also every penny you can\nborrow on a credit card on clothes, cars, cosmetics, socializing,\nentertainment, travel, and everything else. Your mental equation is money =\nenjoyment.\n \nWhen you go on vacation to a resort of any kind, you find that the hotels\nand streets are lined with shops selling useless trinkets, bobbles, and trash,\nplus clothes, artwork, and other items that you would never think of buying\nat home. Why is this? Simple. When you are on vacation, you feel happy.\nYou have a conditioned response to associate happiness with spending\nmoney. The happier you are, the more unconsciously compelled you are to\ngo out and spend money on something—or, rather, on anything.\n \nIt is quite common for many people, when they are unhappy or frustrated\nfor any reason, to go shopping. They unconsciously associate buying\nsomething with being happy. When it doesn’t work as they expected, they\nbuy something else. Sometimes, unhappy people go on shopping sprees.\nThey buy lots of things they don’t particularly need because they\nunconsciously associate spending with happiness.\n\f\nAs an adult, whenever you receive your paycheck, a bonus, a\ncommission, an IRS refund, a prize, or an inheritance, the very first thing\nyou think about is how you can spend this money as quickly as possible and\non as many pleasures as possible.\n\f\nRewire Your Responses About Money\n \nThe starting point of achieving financial independence is to discipline\nyourself to rewire your attitude toward money. You need to reach into your\nsubconscious mind and disconnect the wire linking “spending” and\n“happiness.” You need to then reconnect that “happiness” wire to the\n“saving and investing” wire.\n \nFrom that moment on, instead of saying, “I feel happy when I spend\nmoney,” you will say, “I feel happy when I save money.”\n \nTo reinforce this shift in thinking, open up a “financial freedom account”\nat your local bank. This is the account in which you deposit money for the\nlong term. Once your money goes into this account, you resolve that you\nwill never spend it on anything except the achievement of financial\nfreedom.\n \nIf you want to save money to buy a boat or a car, you open up a separate\naccount solely for that purpose. But your financial freedom account is\ninviolable. You never touch it except to invest those funds so that they can\nyield a higher rate of return.\n\f\nAssociate Happiness with Saving\n \nWhen you begin saving in this way, something miraculous happens within\nyou. You start to feel happy about the idea of having money in the bank.\nEven if you open your account with only $10, this action gives you a\nfeeling of greater self-control and personal power. You feel happier about\nyourself. The very act of disciplining yourself to save money makes you\nfeel stronger and more in control of your destiny.\n \nEach time you get some extra money, you put it into your financial\nfreedom account. Eventually, your financial freedom account will begin to\ngrow. Then, as it grows, you activate two laws: the Law of Attraction and\nthe Law of Accumulation.\n \nBecause the money in your account is emotionalized by your own\nthoughts and feelings, it sets up a force field of energy that begins to attract\nmore money into it. If you save $10 a month for a year, you will be\nastonished to find that with the extra bits of money that you have put into\nthat account, you will probably have more than $200 rather than just $120.\nIf you save $100 per month, you will probably have more than $2,000.\n \nThe Law of Accumulation says that “every great achievement is an\naccumulation of many small achievements.” The Law of Attraction says\nthat “you attract into your life those things that are in harmony with your\ndominant thoughts.” Because of these laws, your financial freedom account\nbegins to grow with the miracle of compound interest.\n\f\nThe more money you have in your bank account, the more energy it\ngenerates and the more money is attracted into your life. You have heard it\nsaid that “it takes money to make money.” This is true. As you begin to\nsave and accumulate money, the universe begins to direct more and more\nmoney toward you that you can save and accumulate.\n \nEveryone who has ever practiced this principle of regular saving is\nabsolutely astonished at how quickly their financial fortunes change for the\nbetter.\n \nThe rule for financial independence, once you have rewired your attitude\ntoward money, is to “pay yourself first.” Most people save whatever is left\nover after their monthly expenses—if there is anything left over at all. The\nkey, however, is to pay yourself first, off the top, from every amount of\nmoney you receive.\n\f\nSave Throughout Your Lifetime\n \nIt used to be that if you saved 10 percent of your income from your first\npaycheck until you retired, you would be financially independent, if not\nrich. Today, however, financial advisers suggest that you need to save 15 or\n20 percent of your income in order to achieve all your financial goals. Any\nless than this opens you up to the risk of running out of money later in life.\n \nWhen we suggest to people that they need to begin saving 10 percent of\ntheir incomes, they shake their heads. Most people are spending everything\nthey earn today. They have nothing left over. Most people are deeply in debt\nas well. The idea of saving 10 percent of their income, right off the top,\nappears impossible. But there is a solution.\n\f\nPractice the 1 Percent Formula\n \nBegin today to save 1 percent of your income and learn to live on the other\n99 percent. This is a manageable amount. This is a number that you can get\nyour mind around. It requires only a small amount of self-discipline and\ndelayed gratification for you to save 1 percent each month. If you are\nearning $3,000 per month, 1 percent is $30 per month, or only $1 per day.\n \nAt the end of each day, come home and put your daily amount into a box\nor jar. Once per month, take your accumulated savings down to the bank\nand put it into your financial freedom account. This sounds like a small\nbeginning, but remember that “a journey of a thousand leagues begins with\na single step.”\n \nIn no time at all, you will become comfortable living on 99 percent of\nyour income. At that point, you raise your savings level to 2 percent of your\nincome per month. You then adjust your lifestyle to live on 98 percent. In\nno time, this will become a habit; you will find it automatic and easy to live\non 98 percent of what you earn.\n \nMonth by month, you then increase your savings level by 1 percent. By\nthe end of the year, you will probably be saving 10 percent of your income.\nThen something else remarkable will start to happen. Your debts will start\nto decline. As you become consciously aware of saving your money and\nmoving toward financial independence, you will become more intelligent\nand thoughtful about each expenditure. You will find yourself spending less\nand gradually paying off your debts, month by month.\n\f\nThe Payoff Is Tremendous\n \nThe reward for saving and investing is substantial. It is said that “happiness\nis the progressive realization of a worthy ideal.” So every time you save a\ndollar or pay off a dollar of indebtedness, you feel happy inside. You feel\nmore positive and in control of your life. Your brain releases endorphins,\nwhich in turn give you a feeling of calmness and well-being.\n \nWithin two years of beginning this process, you will have worked your\nway out of debt and will have begun to accumulate a growing amount of\nmoney in your financial freedom account. As this amount increases, you\nwill begin to attract into your life more money and more opportunities to\ndeploy those funds intelligently so that they yield a higher rate of return.\n \nAt the same time, your attitude toward money and spending will\ngradually change. You will become more disciplined and conscientious.\nYou will investigate carefully before you invest. You will study every\naspect of a potential business or opportunity. You will be reluctant to part\nwith money that you have worked so hard to accumulate. You will actually\nbegin to reshape your attitude and personality toward money—and do so in\na very positive way.\n\f\nIncome Increases Don’t Help\n \nSometimes I ask my audiences, “Who here would like to be financially\nindependent?” Everybody raises their hand. So then I ask, “If I could wave\na magic wand and double the income of every person in this room, would\nthat help you to become financially independent?”\n \nEverybody cheers and laughs and nods their head, agreeing that if they\ncould miraculously double their income, they could become financially\nindependent.\n \nI then ask them, “How many people in this room, from the time you took\nyour first job to today, have already doubled your income?”\n \nWithout hesitation, every hand in the room goes up.\n \nI then ask, “How many people here, from the time you took your first job\nto today, have increased your income three times? Five times? Ten times?”\n \nHands go up all over the room. Everyone in the room has doubled or\ntripled or increased their income five or ten times from the time they took\ntheir first job.\n \nI then make my point: “Everyone here has already increased their income\ndramatically, but it has done no good. Simply increasing your income does\nnot ensure that you will achieve financial independence. This is because of"

    "raw_text": "Parkinson’s Law, which says, ‘Expenditures rise to meet income.’ No\nmatter how much you earn, you end up spending it all, and more besides.”\n\f\nPractice the Wedge Principle\n \nThe way to achieve financial independence is for you to break Parkinson’s\nLaw. You do this by practicing the “Wedge Principle” for the rest of your\nlife. Here is how you do it: As your income increases in the months and\nyears ahead, drive a wedge between your increasing income and your\nincreasing expenses. Instead of spending it all, resolve that you will save 50\npercent of your “increase.”\n \nIf your income increases by $100 per month, resolve to save $50 per\nmonth, off the top, and put it into your financial freedom account. You can\nspend the other $50 on your family and on improving your lifestyle. But\nyou must resolve to save half of your increase for the rest of your financial\nlife.\n \nWhen you pay yourself first, saving 10 or 15 percent of your income off\nthe top and then saving 50 percent of your increase for the rest of your\ncareer, you will soon achieve financial independence. You will join the top\n5 percent of wealthy people in our society. You will never have to worry\nabout money again.\n\f\nThe Miracle of Compound Interest\n \nAlbert Einstein said, “Compound interest is the most powerful force in the\nuniverse.”\n \nIf, from the age of twenty-one until you are sixty-five, you were to save\nonly $100 per month and invest that amount in a mutual fund or index fund\nthat increased an average of 7 to 10 percent per year, you would be worth\nmore than a million dollars. If you were to set up your payroll account so\nthat $100 were automatically deducted and invested for you, you could be\nsure of becoming one of the wealthiest people in America.\n \nThis means that if you are serious about achieving financial\nindependence, the most important single requirement is self-discipline\ncombined with the ability to delay gratification. Your ability to practice\nself-mastery, self-control, and self-denial throughout your life will not only\nenable you to achieve all your financial goals, but it will also make you\nsuccessful and happy in everything else you do.\n \nIn the next chapter, we will talk about the key to making almost\neverything in your life work for you: the use of your time. We all start off in\nlife with lots of time and little money. How you spend your time throughout\nyour adult years largely determines the quality of your life.\n  \nAction Exercises:"

    "raw_text": "Chapter 13\n \nSelf-Discipline and Time Management\n \n“If you do not conquer self, you will be conquered by self.”\n—NAPOLEON HILL\n \n \n \n \nThere is perhaps no area of your life in which self-discipline is more\nimportant than in the way you manage your time. Time management is a\ncore discipline that largely determines the quality of your life. As Peter\nDrucker said, “You cannot manage time; you can only manage yourself.”\n \nTime management is really life management, personal management,\nmanagement of yourself rather than of time or circumstances.\n \nTime is perishable; it cannot be saved. Time is irreplaceable; nothing else\nwill do. Time is irretrievable; once it is gone or wasted, you can never get it\nback. Finally, time is indispensable, especially for accomplishments of any\nkind. All achievement, all results, all success requires time.\n\f\nYou Can’t “Save” Time\n \nThe fact is that you cannot save time; you can only spend it differently. You\ncan only reallocate your time usage from areas of low value to areas of high\nvalue. Herein lies the key to success, and the requirement for self-\ndiscipline.\n \nTime management is the ability to choose the sequence of events. By\nexerting your self-discipline with regard to time, you can choose what to do\nfirst, second, and not at all. And you are always free to choose.\n \nYou require tremendous self-discipline to overcome the procrastination\nand delay that holds most people back from great success. A native Indian\nonce told me that “procrastination is the thief of dreams.”\n \nThe Pareto Principle, the 80/20 rule, says that 20 percent of the things\nyou do account for 80 percent of the value of what you accomplish. This\nmeans that 80 percent of what you do is worth 20 percent or less of the\nvalue of what you accomplish.\n\f\nAssess the True Value of Everything You Do\n \nSome things you do are five times and even ten times more valuable than\nother things, even though they take the same number of minutes and hours.\nThe most important things you do—the top 20 percent—are usually big,\ndifficult, and daunting. In contrast, the 80 percent of things that you do that\nmake little or no difference to your life are usually fun, easy, and enjoyable.\n \nYou can tell the value that something has to you by the amount of your\ntime you invest in it. You always pay attention to and spend time on what\nyou most value, whether it is your family, your health, your social or sports\nactivities, or your money and career. It is only by looking at how you spend\nyour time that you (and everyone else) know what is really important to\nyou.\n \nSome people say that career success is most important to them, and then\nthey go home and watch television several hours per day. Some people say\ntheir families are important to them, and then they go out socializing or\nplaying golf. Only your actions tell you—and others—what you truly\nvalue.\n \nThe essence of time management is for you to discipline yourself to set\nclear priorities—and then stick to those priorities. You must consciously\nand deliberately select the most valuable and important thing that you could\nbe doing at any given time, and then discipline yourself to work solely on\nthat task."

    "raw_text": "Personal Strategic Planning\n \nIn corporate strategic planning, the main focus is on increasing the “return\non equity.” Equity in a business is defined as the amount of money invested\nin the business by the owners (aside from debt and money borrowed). The\npurpose of strategic planning is to find ways to organize and reorganize the\nbusiness in such a way that the company is achieving a higher rate of return\non this equity than it would be in the absence of the planning process.\n \nCompanies invest financial capital, but individuals invest “human\ncapital.” Companies deploy financial assets, but your most vital assets are\nyour mental, emotional, and physical energies. How you invest them\ndetermines your entire quality of life.\n \nIn personal strategic planning, your goal is to get the highest “return on\nenergy” from your activities. Ken Blanchard refers to this as getting the\nhighest “return on life.”\n \nJust as you would be careful about investing your money so as to ensure\nthat you get the highest rate of return, you must be equally careful when\nyou invest your time. You must be sure that you earn the highest level of\nresults, rewards, and satisfaction from the limited amount of time you have.\n\f\nThink Before You Act\n \nBefore you commit to any time-consuming activity, you must always ask,\n“Is this the very best use of my time?”\n \nLack of self-discipline in time management leads people to procrastinate\ntheir top tasks continually, causing them to spend more and more time on\ntasks of low or no value. And whatever you do repeatedly eventually\nbecomes a habit.\n \nMany people have developed the habit of procrastination, of putting off\ntheir major tasks and instead spending most of their time on activities that\nmake very little difference in the long run.\n\f\nPriorities versus Posteriorities\n \nSetting priorities requires setting posteriorities as well. A priority is\nsomething that you do more of and sooner, whereas a posteriority is\nsomething you do less of or later. You are probably already overwhelmed\nwith too much to do and too little time. Because of this, for you to embark\non a new task, you must discontinue an old task. Getting into something\nnew requires getting out of another activity. Before you commit to a new\nundertaking, ask yourself, “What am I going to stop doing so that I have\nenough time to work on this new task?”\n \nGo through your life regularly and practice “creative abandonment”:\nConsciously determine the activities that you are going to discontinue so\nthat you have more time to spend on those tasks that can really make a\ndifference to your future.\n\f\nIdentify the Consequences\n \nOne of the most important words in developing the discipline of time\nmanagement is “consequences.” Something is important to the degree that it\nhas serious potential consequences for completion or noncompletion. A\ntask or activity is unimportant to the degree that it does not matter if it is\ndone or not.\n \nFor example, completing a course of study at the university can have\nenormous consequences that can impact your life for the next fifty years.\nCompleting a major task or project at work or making an important sale can\nhave significant consequences for your job and your income.\n \nOn the other hand, drinking coffee, chatting with coworkers, reading the\nnewspaper, surfing the Internet, or checking emails may be enjoyable, but\nthese activities have few or no consequences. In other words, whether you\ndo them or not makes little to no difference to your work or your life.\nHowever, it is precisely on these activities that most people spend most of\ntheir time.\n\f\nManaging Your Time\n \nThere is a simple time management system that you can use to overcome\nprocrastination. It requires self-discipline, willpower, and personal\norganization, but the payoff is huge. When you use this system, you can\ndouble or even triple your productivity, performance, output, and income.\n \nBefore you begin each day, start by making a list of everything you have\nto do that day. The best time to make this list is the evening before, at the\nend of the workday, so that your subconscious mind can work on your list\nof activities while you sleep. You will often wake up with ideas and insights\nfor how to more effectively complete the tasks of the day.\n \nThen apply the A B C D E Method to your list:\n• A = “Must do”—Serious consequences for noncompletion;\n• B = “Should do”—Mild consequences for doing or not doing;\n• C = “Nice to do”—No consequences whether you do it or not;\n• D = “Delegate”—Everything you possibly can to free up more\ntime for those things that only you can do;\n• E = “Eliminate”—Discontinue all tasks and activities that are no\nlonger essential to your work and to achieving your goals.\n \nReview your list of activities for the coming day and write an A, B, C, D,\nor E next to each task before you start.\n \nIf you have several “A” tasks, rank them by importance by writing A-1,\nA-2, A-3, and so on. Do this with your B and C tasks as well.\n\f\nThe rule is that you should never do a B task when you have an A task\nleft undone. You should never do a lower-value task when you have a\nhigher-value task before you.\n \nOnce you have organized your list using this system, discipline yourself\nto start on your A-1 task first thing in the morning, before you do anything\nelse."

    "raw_text": "Practice Single-Handling\n \nOnce you have begun work on your most important task, you must\ndiscipline yourself to concentrate single-mindedly, with 100 percent of your\ntime and attention, until that task is complete.\n \nIt takes tremendous self-discipline to select your most important task and\nthen to start on that task rather than doing anything else. But once you begin\nto work on it, you will start to feel a flow of energy that motivates and\npropels you into the task. You will feel more positive and confident. You\nwill feel happier and more determined. The very act of starting on an\nimportant task raises your self-esteem and motivates you to continue.\n \nDeep within each person is an intense desire to feel strong, effective,\npowerful, and in control of his or her life. You automatically trigger these\nfeelings of self-confidence and self-esteem when you discipline yourself to\nstart work on the task that is most important to you at the moment.\n\f\n1,000 Percent Return on Investment\n \nThis A B C D E Method seldom takes more than about ten minutes to\norganize your entire day. But you will save ten minutes in execution for\nevery minute that you invest in this way of planning before you begin.\n \nThis means that you will get a 1,000 percent “return on energy” from the\nact of planning thoroughly and setting clear priorities before you start on\nyour first task.\n \nAs you feel yourself moving forward, making progress on your most\nimportant task, your brain releases a steady flow of endorphins, nature’s\n“happy drug.” These endorphins will make you feel more positive, focused,\nalert, aware, and in control.\n \nWhen you discipline yourself to push against your natural resistance to\nget started on your most important task, you get an “endorphin rush.” You\nexperience this as a sense of elation, exhilaration, happiness, and high self-\nesteem. By completing a major task, you feel exactly like an athlete who\nhas crossed the finish line first. You feel like a winner.\n \nYour payoff from excellent time management is never ending. As soon as\nyou begin to plan and organize your time, set priorities, and begin on your\nA-1 task, you will feel happy and more in control of yourself and your life.\nThe better you plan and execute, the better you feel.\n\f\nKeep Yourself Focused\n \nThe Law of Forced Efficiency says, “There is never enough time to do\neverything, but there is always enough time to do the most important\nthings.”\n \nHere are some questions that you should ask yourself, to help keep you\nfocused and working on your top tasks, activities, and responsibilities:\n \n1. Why am I on the payroll? Exactly what have I been hired to do?\nWhat results are expected of me?\n \nYou must be clear about your answer to this question. Discuss it with\nothers. Ask your boss.\n \n2. What are my key result areas? Of all the things I do, what are the\nmost important results that I am expected to achieve in my position?\n \nThere are seldom more than five to seven key result areas in any job. It is\nessential that you identify yours and then work in those areas all day long.\n \n3. What are my highest value activities? Of all the things I do, which\nactivities contribute the greatest value to my company and to myself?\n\f\nYou have core competencies that enable you to make a valuable\ncontribution. What are they?\n \n4. What can I—and only I—do, that if done well, will make a real\ndifference?\n \nThere is only one answer to this question at any given time. This is\nsomething that you and only you can do. If you don’t do it, no one else will\ndo it instead. But if you do it—and you do it well—it can make a\ntremendous difference in your life and work.\n \n5. What is the most valuable use of my time right now?\n \nThis is the most important of all questions for setting priorities and\novercoming procrastination. At every minute of every day, there is an\nanswer to this question. Your ability to organize your life and to select your\nhighest priority is a key measure of your intelligence and your\neffectiveness.\n\f\nStart Today\n \nStarting today, you should apply these key time management principles to\nevery area of your life. Apply them to your work, family, health, exercise\nroutine, and financial decisions and activities. No excuses.\n \nYou require tremendous discipline to set priorities and then stick to those\npriorities. You require the continuous exertion of discipline and willpower\nto overcome the procrastination that holds most people back. However, the\nmore you discipline yourself to use your time well, the happier you will feel\nand the better will be the quality of your life in every area.\n \nWhat stands between you and your goals are almost always problems and\ndifficulties of some kind. Your ability to effectively solve the problems of\ndaily life can have an enormous impact on your results and rewards. We\nwill talk about this in the next chapter.\n  \nAction Exercises:\n 1. Make a decision today to become absolutely excellent at\ntime management. Work at it until it becomes a habit.\n2. Before you begin each day, make a list of everything you\nhave to do that day. As new tasks arise, write them down before\nyou act on them.\n3. Organize your work list by priority by using the A B C D\nE Method over and over until it becomes a habit.\n\f\n4. Identify your A-1 task each day and resolve to work\nsingle-mindedly on that task until it is totally complete.\n5. Identify the one task that only you can do and that, if you\ndo it well, can make a real difference.\n6. Determine the 20 percent of your tasks that can account\nfor 80 percent of your results, and then discipline yourself to\nwork on them most of the time.\n7. Every minute of every day, ask yourself, “What is the\nmost valuable use of my time, right now?” and then discipline\nyourself to work on only that task until it is complete."

    "raw_text": "Chapter 14\n \nSelf-Discipline and Problem Solving\n \n“Experience is not what happens to a man; it is what a man does with\nwhat happens to him.”\n—ALDOUS HUXLEY\n \n \n \n \nThoughts are causes and conditions are effects. Therefore, the quality of\nyour thinking largely determines the quality of your life. The greatest\nmental principle is that “you become what you think about most of the\ntime.”\n \nTop people in every field are intensively solution-oriented . They think\nabout solutions most of the time. Instead of getting bogged down in who\ndid or didn’t do something or other, the most successful people in every\nfield concentrate on the solutions and what can be done to solve the\nproblem.\n \nThe Sufi philosopher Izrhat Khan once said, “Life is a continuous\nsuccession of problems, like waves from the ocean. They never stop.” This\nmeans that your ability to practice self-discipline, self-mastery, and self-\ncontrol when faced with the never-ending flow of problems, difficulties,\nsetbacks, and temporary failures you will experience is essential to your\nsuccess in business and in life.\n\f\nThe Inevitable and Unavoidable Crisis\n \nThroughout your life, you will face a river of problems—physical,\nfinancial, family, business, and political. The only break in this never-\nending chain of problems will be the occasional crisis. If you are living a\nnormal life, you will probably experience a crisis every two or three\nmonths. And it is in these crises that you truly demonstrate the quality of\nyour personality and the strength of your character.\n \nIt is only when you face unexpected reversals and setbacks that you show\nthe world what you are truly made of. All of life is a “test.” The only\nquestion for you is do you pass or fail?\n \nBy their very nature, crises come “unbidden.” You have no warning or\nability to anticipate them in advance. If you did, it wouldn’t be a crisis in\nthe first place—obviously, or you would already be prepared. When the\ninevitable crisis occurs, more than at any other time, self-discipline is\nrequired so you can remain calm and clear-headed in order to deal with the\ncrisis effectively.\n\f\nPerform at Your Best\n \nWhen something goes wrong, the natural tendency of most people is to\nbecome angry and look around for someone to blame. But this is a waste of\nenergy. It solves nothing. Instead, you must discipline yourself to remain\ncalm, objective, and unemotional.\n \nWhen you face an unexpected problem or crisis, discipline yourself to\nstay calm, to focus on the solution rather than the problem. Think in terms\nof what can be done now, rather than thinking about how it occurred and\nwho is to blame.\n \nLike an accident where someone is hurt, you focus on caring for the\ninjured person, stopping the bleeding, and minimizing the damage before\nyou start analyzing what and how it happened. Practice self-discipline when\ndealing with a problem or crisis by immediately saying, “I am responsible,”\neven if, at that moment, you are responsible only for controlling your\nresponses.\n\f\nKeep Your Mind Clear\n \nTop people have developed the ability to respond effectively to a crisis, to\nremain calm, relaxed, and clear-eyed. They discipline themselves to stay\ncool and unemotional. This enables them to think more clearly, to analyze\nthe situation objectively, and to make better decisions.\n \nBut the moment you become angry and upset, your neocortex—or your\n“thinking brain”—shuts down. All you have left then is your paleocortex,\nyour emotional brain, which thinks in terms of “fight or flight.” When your\nemotional brain is in charge, you think in terms of black and white, yes or\nno, or doing something or doing nothing. You lose the ability to think in\nshades of gray and to look at all the different possible ways to deal with this\nparticular situation.\n \nTop people realize that every problem is an opportunity to grow in self-\ncontrol and personal confidence. In fact, you will rise in life to the height of\nthe problems that you are capable of solving."

    "raw_text": "Stepping Stones to Success\n \nSome years ago, Dr. Lawrence Peter wrote a book called The Peter\nPrinciple. It was an amusing book with a central thesis that cut too close to\nhome. He wrote that in every organization, people continue to be promoted\nuntil they reach a level where they are no longer competent to solve the\nproblems at that level. This is where they stop and stay for the rest of their\ncareers.\n \nFurthermore, he pointed out that for this reason, every organization is\neventually staffed by people who have reached their level of incompetence.\nThis is especially true in government, and it is the primary reason why\ngovernment is so time- and cost-inefficient, making it difficult to get\nanything done at all. This is usually true in any large bureaucracy.\n \nIn your own personal life, you continue to rise in your company and your\nprofession in direct proportion to your ability to solve the problems and\nmake the necessary decisions at each level of your career. The good news is\nthat when you think about solutions most of the time, you train your brain\nto be intensively solution oriented.\n \nNo matter what problems or difficulties arise around you, your brain will\nbe continually seeking creative ways to solve the problem. As a result, you\nactually become smarter and quicker, with more of your thinking brain\navailable to you faster.\n \nIf you want to learn a physical sport, you begin by learning the basic\nmoves and then the more advanced moves. You practice these skills over\n\f\nand over again until you can perform them and go through the motions\nnaturally and easily every time.\n \nTo master the discipline of problem solving, you need to develop a\nformula or method that enables you to deal effectively with almost any\nproblem you face in the course of your career or personal life. Fortunately,\nthere is a proven formula for problem solving and decision making that you\ncan use in almost any situation. Let’s take a look.\n\f\nA Nine-Step Method for Solving Problems Effectively\n \nStep 1: Take the Time to Define the Problem Clearly. In medicine, they say\nthat “accurate diagnosis is half the cure.” Therefore, you need to ask, “What\nexactly is the problem?” It is absolutely amazing how several people can\nbecome upset about a problem in an organization, but every one of them has\na different idea or definition of the exact nature of the problem they’re\nfacing. Your job is to achieve clarity and to get everyone to agree on the\ndefinition of the problem before you move on to the business of solving it.\n \nStep 2: Ask, “Is It Really a Problem?” Remember, there are some things\nthat you can do nothing about. They’re not problems; they are merely facts\nof life. If interest rates rise or the subprime mortgage market collapses, this\nis not a problem. It is not something that is amenable to a solution. Instead,\nit is something that must be worked around and dealt with.\n \nAlso, very often what appears to be a problem or a setback is actually an\nopportunity in disguise. Sometimes, the problem does not need to be solved\nat all. Instead, you are now free to do something completely different—\nwhich might be even better for you and your organization.\n  \nStep 3: Ask, “What Else Is the Problem?” Beware of any problem for\nwhich there is only one definition. The more ways you can define a\nproblem, the more likely it is that you will find the best solution.\n \nWhen we work with corporations in which sales are below a desired\nlevel, we force them to ask twenty-one questions, all of which are\n\f\ndifferent ways of restating the problem. Each restatement of the\nproblem, if accepted as the correct definition, leads to a different\nsolution and often to a completely different direction for the\norganization.\n \nFor example, we will ask, “What is the problem?” and the first\nanswer is “Our sales are too low.”\n \nThe next question is “What else is the problem?”\n \nAnswer: “Our competitor’s sales are too high.”\n \nNotice the difference. If the problem is that your sales are too low,\nthe solution may be to increase your advertising and promotion and\nbeef up your sales activities. If the definition is that your competitor’s\nsales are too high, the answer may be to improve your products,\nchange your product line, lower your prices, or go into a completely\ndifferent business altogether.\n \nBy asking and answering a series of questions like this, we\neventually find the correct definition, one that is amenable to a\nworkable solution.\n  \nStep 4: Ask, “How Did This Problem Occur?” Seek to understand the\ncauses of the problem so you can ensure that it doesn’t happen again. In\nyour life or business, if a problem recurs repeatedly, it is a sign that your\nbusiness is poorly organized or out of control in that area. There is a defect\nbuilt into your systems that is causing the same problem to recur. Your job\nis to find out why this happens repeatedly so you can solve the problem at\nits root.\n\f\nStep 5: Ask, “What Are All the Possible Solutions?” The more possible\nsolutions you develop, the more likely you will come up with the right one.\nThe quality of the solution seems to be in direct proportion to the quantity\nof solutions considered in problem solving. Beware a problem for which\nthere is only one solution.\n  \nStep 6: Ask, “What Is the Best Solution at This Time?” Sometimes, any\nsolution is better than no solution. An average solution vigorously executed\nis often superior to an excellent solution that cannot be implemented\nbecause of its complexity or because no one has the ability to execute it.\n \nThe rule is that fully 80 percent of all problems should be dealt with\nimmediately. Only 20 percent of problems need to be put off to a later time.\nIf you must put off a problem, set a specific deadline for making a decision\non that problem, and then make your decision at that deadline with\nwhatever information you have at that time.\n \nThere is a rule that says that every large problem was once a small\nproblem that could have been solved easily and inexpensively at that time.\nSometimes, the best strategy is to “nip it in the bud.” When it is clear that\nthere is a problem and a solution, do what has to be done—and do it\nquickly.\n  \nStep 7: Make a Decision. Select a solution, any solution, and then decide\non a course of action. Always ask, “What is our next action? What are we\ngoing to do now?”\n  \nStep 8: Assign Responsibility. Who exactly is going to carry out the\nsolution or the different elements of the solution? It is quite common for a\ngroup to meet to solve a problem and to agree on a solution, but when the\n\f\ngroup meets again two weeks later, it turns out that nothing has happened.\nWhy? No one was made specifically responsible for carrying out the\ndecision.\n  \nStep 9: Set a Measure for the Decision. What are you trying to accomplish\nwith this decision, and how will you measure results? How will you know\nthat it worked? The more accurately you can determine the result that you\nwant to achieve by the solution, the more likely it is that you will achieve it.\n\f\nThe Big Reward\n \nThe main reward you get for solving problems is the opportunity to solve\nbigger and more important problems. Your rate of pay and speed of\npromotion and therefore your forward movement in your career are largely\ndetermined by your problem-solving ability. The more you focus on\nsolutions, the more solutions you will come up with, and the more valuable\nyour contribution will be to your organization.\n \nThe flip side of self-esteem is called “self-efficacy.” Your level of self-\nefficacy is defined as “how competent you feel you are to solve your\nproblems and achieve your goals.”\n \nThe more competent you feel you are to solve the problems and\ndifficulties of daily life, the more you like yourself. The more you like\nyourself, the more confident and competent you become in solving even\nlarger problems and getting even more important results."

    "raw_text": "Chapter 15\n \nSelf-Discipline and Happiness\n \n“No horse gets anywhere until he is harnessed. No stream or gas\ndrives anything until it is confined. No Niagara is ever turned into\nlight and power until it is tunneled. No life ever grows great until it is\nfocused, dedicated, disciplined.”\n—HARRY EMERSON FOSDICK\n \n \n \n \nYour ability to achieve your own happiness is the true measure of your\nsuccess in life. Nothing is more important. Nothing can replace it. If you\naccomplish everything of a material nature, but you are not happy, you have\nactually failed at fulfilling your potential as a human being.\n \nIn Chapter 4, I described how human beings are purposeful, striving\ntoward achieving goals and end results. However, behind each goal lies\nanother goal, and then still another goal, until you finally arrive at the\n“primum movum,” or first-moving force, in human life. This always turns\nout to be the desire to be happy. You can only truly be happy when you\npractice self-discipline, self-mastery, and self-control. It is only when you\nfeel that you are in complete control of your life that you are truly content.\n\f\nThe Law of Control\n \nIn my book Maximum Achievement, I teach the importance of the Law of\nControl, which states, “You feel happy to the degree to which you feel you\nare in control of your own life. You feel unhappy to the degree to which you\nfeel you are not in control, or controlled by other factors or people.”\n \nPsychologists call this your “locus of control.” There are fifty years of\nresearch and hundreds of books and articles on this subject. They all\nconclude that stress and unhappiness arise when you feel controlled by\noutside circumstances. This is explained as the difference between an\n“internal locus of control” (happy) and an “external locus of control”\n(unhappy).\n \nYou have an internal locus of control when you feel that you are in\ncharge, you make your own decisions, and what happens to you in life is\nlargely determined by yourself. When you have an internal locus of control,\nyou feel that you are behind the wheel of your own life and that you are in\nthe driver’s seat. You feel that you determine most of what happens to you.\nAs a result, you feel strong, purposeful, and happy.\n \nOn the other hand, you have an external locus of control to the degree to\nwhich you feel that you are not in control or that you have little ability to\ndirect your own life. For example, if you feel that you are controlled by an\narbitrary or critical boss, but you cannot afford to lose your job because you\nhave no savings put aside, you experience high levels of stress and anxiety.\nThis causes you to do a poor job, which makes it even more likely that your\n\f\ndifficult boss will fire you, and this very often brings about exactly the\ncircumstances you fear.\n \nAnother example is that you may feel you are controlled by a bad\nmarriage or relationship from which you cannot escape. You may feel\ncontrolled by your bills, by the money you owe, and your obligations to\nmaintain your standard of living. You may feel that you are controlled by\nyour physical condition or lack of education. Many people feel that they are\ncontrolled by their past because of a difficult childhood or upbringing and\nthat there is nothing they can do to change their situation.\n \nMany people feel that they are controlled by their own personalities and\nthat they are not able to change for the better. They say, “That’s just the way\nI am.” By saying this, they absolve themselves of all responsibility for\nexerting the necessary discipline and willpower to make the changes they\nknow they need to make in order to live the kind of life they want to live\nand to be happy.\n \nThe key to replacing an external locus of control with an internal locus\nof control is for you to decide today to take complete charge of your life.\nRealize and accept that you make your own decisions and that you are\nwhere you are and what you are because of yourself. If there is some area in\nyour life in which you are not happy, discipline yourself to do whatever it\ntakes to change the situation.\n\f\nThe Reason for Happiness\n \nIt is often the size of the gap between your present situation and the\nconditions and circumstances that you feel that you need to be happy that\ndetermines whether you are happy or unhappy. This is very much a matter\nof your own evaluation and decision.\n \nThere is an old saying that “success is getting what you want; happiness\nis wanting what you get.” When your income and your life are consistent\nwith your goals and expectations and you are content with your situation,\nyou feel happy. If, on the other hand, for any reason your current situation is\ndifferent from what you really want and expect, you will be discontented\nand unhappy.\n \nThis state of contentment can be constantly changing. When you start off\nin your career, an income of $50,000 per year can seem like a huge\nachievement. But once you reach this goal, you start to be unhappy because\nyou are not earning $100,000 or more. Some people are unhappy earning a\nmillion dollars a year.\n\f\nHappiness Is a By-Product\n \nThe interesting thing about happiness is that it is not a goal that you can aim\nat and achieve in and of itself. Happiness is a by-product that comes to you\nwhen you are engaged in doing something that you really enjoy while in the\ncompany of people who you like and respect.\n \nEarl Nightingale, perhaps the most famous and respected radio\ncommentator on success in history, said that “happiness is the progressive\nrealization of a worthy ideal.” Whenever you feel that you are moving,\nstep-by-step, toward something that is important to you, toward your most\nimportant goals, you automatically feel happy. You feel satisfied and\ncontent. You feel a tremendous sense of personal growth and well-being."

    "raw_text": "Five Ingredients of Happiness\n \n1. Health and energy. This is perhaps the most important element of a good\nlife. We strive for it all our lives. It is only when you enjoy high levels of\npain-free health and a continuous flow of energy that you feel truly happy.\n \nIn many cases, health is a “deficiency need.” This means that you do not\nthink about your health very much until you are deprived of it. For example,\nyou do not think about your teeth until you have a toothache. You do not\nthink about your body until you have aches or pains of some kind.\n \nYou must use discipline and willpower throughout your life to achieve\nand maintain high levels of health and fitness. Chapters 16 and 17 cover\nthese in more detail.\n  \n2. Happy relationships. Fully 85 percent of your happiness—or\nunhappiness—will come from your relationships with other people. As\nAristotle said, “Man is a social animal.” We are designed to function in\nsociety, working and living with other people at every stage of our lives.\n \nYour ability to enter into and maintain high-quality relationships with\nyour spouse, children, friends, colleagues, and others is the true measure of\nthe quality of your personality and your level of mental health. People with\nhigh levels of self-esteem and self-respect get along better with others and\nhave much happier lives.\n\f\nOne of our biggest mistakes is to take our relationships for granted,\nespecially our most important ones. We often don’t think about them until\nthere is a problem, and then we think of nothing else.\n  \n3. Meaningful work. To be truly happy, you must be fully engaged with\nlife. You must be doing things that keep you active and give you a sense of\nfulfillment. If you are making a living, you must be doing work that you\nenjoy, do well, and for which you are well paid.\n \nPeople are truly happy only when they feel they are making a\ncontribution of some kind, that they are putting in more than they are\ntaking out. You need to feel that what you do really makes a difference in\nthe lives and work of other people.\n \nIn studies of employee motivation, employers think that people are\nprimarily motivated by money and benefits. But when employees are\nsurveyed, the three factors that motivate them the most turn out to be\nchallenging and interesting work; opportunities for growth and\nadvancement; and pleasant coworkers.\n   \nOne of your most important responsibilities to yourself is to find the right\njob for you, and then, once you have it, throw your whole heart into it. If for\nany reason, you do not feel like putting your whole heart into your work, it\nmay be lacking one or more of the three essentials to a positive workplace.\nIt may be a sign that this is not the right place for you.\n  \n4. Financial independence. Some of the greatest fears we experience are\nthose of loss, failure, and poverty. We fear being destitute, without funds,\nand dependent on others."

    "raw_text": "One of your chief responsibilities to yourself is to work toward financial\nindependence and financial freedom throughout your life. The happiest of\nall people are those who have reached the point at which they no longer\nworry about money. This is not something you can leave to chance, but\nrather something that requires deliberate, purposeful action and tremendous\nself-discipline to achieve.\n \nWhenever you feel that there is a big gap between where you are today\nfinancially and where you would ideally like to be, you experience stress,\nworry, and unhappiness.\n  \n5. Self-actualization. This is the feeling that you are becoming everything\nyou are capable of becoming. This occurs when you feel that you are\nrealizing more and more of your true potential.\n \nAbraham Maslow is best known for his Hierarchy of Needs. He\ndetermined that people have both “deficiency needs” and “being needs.”\nPeople strive either to compensate for their deficiencies or to realize their\npotentials. He concluded that you begin to evolve and develop to the\nhighest levels possible for you only when your deficiency needs are first\nsatisfied.\n \nDeficiency Needs. Your first deficiency need is for safety and survival.\nSatisfying this need requires that you have sufficient food, water, clothing,\nand accommodation to preserve your life and well-being. If for any reason\nyour safety or survival is threatened, you will become totally preoccupied\nwith satisfying this need. You will experience tremendous stress, and you\nwill be completely unhappy until you are safe once more. For example,\nthink about being in a life-threatening situation.\n\f\nThe second deficiency need that Maslow identified is the need for\nsecurity. This need embraces financial, emotional, and physical security.\nYou need to have enough money to provide for yourself, security in your\nrelationships at work and at home, and physical security to assure that you\nare not in danger of any kind. If your security needs are threatened, you\nbecome completely preoccupied with them. For example, think about losing\nyour job suddenly: How would you feel?\n \nThe third deficiency need that Maslow identified is belongingness. Each\nperson has a need to be in social relationships with others, both at home and\nat work. You need to be recognized and accepted by other people in your\nworld. Each person needs to be comfortable in his or her relationships with\nothers and seen and accepted as part of a team or group.\n \nSelf-Esteem Needs. Once you have achieved a sufficient level of each of\nthese basic needs—safety, security, and belongingness—you then turn to\nsatisfy the higher needs for self-esteem and self-worth, your being needs.\nYour self-esteem is the core of your personality and largely determines how\nyou feel about everything that happens to you. Everything you do in life is\neither to increase your self-esteem or to protect it from being diminished.\n \nYour self-esteem—how you feel about yourself and how much you like\nand value yourself—determines your happiness more than any other single\nfactor. Your self-esteem comes from many factors. When you are liked and\naccepted by others, living consistently with your highest values, doing a\ngood job and being recognized for it, and moving progressively toward the\nachievement of your goals and ideals, then you naturally feel happy and\nsatisfied. You feel valuable and very much in control.\n \nThe Highest Human Need. The highest need that Maslow identified was\nfor self-actualization. He concluded that less than 2 percent of the\npopulation ever reaches this height of personal fulfillment. Most people\nremain so preoccupied with their deficiency needs and protecting or\n\f\nenhancing their self-esteem and their ego needs that they give little thought\nor effort to self-actualization.\n \nBut it is only when you realize that you have tremendous personal\npotential and begin striving to do, be, and have more than ever before in\nsome area that you begin to experience self-actualization and true\nhappiness.\n \nThe happiest of all people are those who feel that they are doing\nsomething worthwhile and important with their lives. They feel they are\nstretching and moving beyond anything they’ve ever done before. People\ndevoted to self-actualization may be writing books or creating works of art.\nThey may be climbing mountains or competing in sports. They may be\nbuilding businesses or scaling the heights of their professions.\n \nThe wonderful thing about self-actualization needs is that they can never\nbe completely satisfied. As you continually strive throughout your life to be\nand have and do more than ever before, you experience a steady flow of\nhappiness and contentment. You feel that you are becoming more and more\nof what you were truly meant to become."

    "raw_text": "Never Be Satisfied\n \nIn each of these areas, whenever you exert self-discipline and willpower to\novercome the tendency to take the easy way, you feel happier about\nyourself. When you take a leap of faith in the direction of your dreams and\nthen discipline yourself to keep going in spite of all obstacles and hardships,\nyou feel powerful. Your self-esteem and self-confidence increase, and then\nas you move, step by step, toward your ideals, you feel genuinely happy.\n \nIn the next chapter, you will learn how to incorporate self-discipline into\nyour daily health habits to ensure that you live a long, happy, healthy life.\n  \nAction Exercises:\n 1. Identify the areas of your life in which you feel the\nhappiest and the most in control. How could you expand them?\n2. Identify the areas of your life in which you feel controlled\nby other people or factors. What could you do to resolve these\nsituations?\n3.

Identify those activities that give you the greatest feeling\nof personal happiness, your “peak experiences” in life. What\n\f\ncould you do to increase these moments of happiness?\n6. Identify those areas in life in which you feel the most\ndiscontented. What steps could you take immediately to resolve\nthese feelings of discontent?\n7. Define “happiness” for yourself. What does it mean?\nWhat would have to happen for you to feel truly happy? What\ncould you do immediately to create this situation?\n\f\nChapter 16\n \nSelf-Discipline and Personal Health\n \n“Self respect is the root of discipline; the sense of dignity grows with\nthe ability to say no to oneself.”\n—ABRAHAM JOSHUA HESCHEL\n \n \n \n \nMore people are living longer and better today than ever before in human\nhistory, and your goal should be to be one of those people. There is no area\nin which self-discipline is more important than in your practices regarding\nyour health. Your number one goal for yourself should be to live as long\nand as well as you possibly can. This requires lifelong self-discipline with\nyour health habits—and as mentioned in Chapter 15, good health is one of\nthe ingredients of overall happiness.\n \nThe average life expectancy for males today (in 2009) is 76.8 years; for\nfemales 79.8 years, or approximately eighty years, and this number is\nincreasing each year. This means that about 50 percent of the population\nwill die before the age of eighty and about 50 percent will die after the age\nof eighty. Your goal should be to defy the averages and live to age ninety,\nninety-five, or even longer.\n\f\nLiving a Long Life\n \nToday, most causes of early death that had shortened life in the past have\nbeen eliminated in the industrialized world. Diseases such as tuberculosis,\npolio, malaria, cholera, typhus, and others have been wiped out through\nsanitation and modern medicine.\n \nThe predominant causes of early deaths today are heart disease, cancer of\nall kinds, diabetes, and traffic deaths, all of which are subject to your\ncontrol to a certain extent.\n \nYou cannot predict or protect against the unpredictable, like random\naccidents, but you can use your self-discipline to control the controllable in\nyour life.\n\f\nSeven Key Health Habits\n \nThe Alameda Study, covering many thousands of people for more than\ntwenty years, concluded there were seven key health habits that contributed\nthe most to long life:\n1. Eat regularly rather than fasting, starving, or gorging. Eat\nnormal, healthy meals, preferably five or six times per day, with your\nlast meal fully three hours before you go to sleep.\n2. Eat lightly: Overeating makes you tired and sluggish, whereas\neating lightly makes you feel healthy and alert. As Thomas Jefferson\nwrote, “No one ever regretted eating too little after a meal.”\n3. Don’t snack between meals: When you eat, your body has to\nbreak down and digest the foods in your stomach so that they can\nmove into your small intestine. This requires four to five hours. If you\nput food in on top of food that you have already eaten, the digestive\nprocess must start over again, with part of your food at one stage of\ndigestion and another part of your food at another stage. This leads to\nupset stomach, heart-burn, drowsiness (especially in the afternoon),\nand constipation.\n4. Exercise regularly: The ideal is about thirty minutes a day, or\ntwo hundred minutes per week. You can achieve this by walking,\nrunning, swimming, and/or using exercise equipment. You should fully\narticulate every joint every day.\n5. Wear a seatbelt: Right up to age thirty-five, the most common\ncause of premature death is traffic accidents.\n6. Don’t smoke: Smoking is correlated with thirty-two different\nillnesses including lung cancer, eso - phageal cancer, throat cancer,\nstomach cancer, heart disease and a variety of other ailments.\n7. Drink alcohol in moderation: Studies show that one to two\nglasses of wine per day aid digestion and seem to be beneficial to your\noverall health. Anything in excess of that can lead to all kinds of\n\f\nproblems, including overeating, traffic accidents, personality problems,\nand antisocial behavior.\n \nEach of these seven factors that contribute to long life are completely a\nmatter of self-discipline. These seven factors are a matter of choice. They\nare actions that you can choose to take or not take deliberately. They are\ncompletely under your control.\n\f\nThe Five Ps of Excellent Health\n \nIn my personal development seminars, we teach the five “Ps” of excellent\nhealth:\n  \n1. Proper weight: This requires the regular exercise of discipline and\nwillpower in order to achieve your proper weight and then to maintain it\nthroughout your life, but the payoff is tremendous. You look good, feel\ngood, and generally feel more positive and in control of your life.\n  \n2. Proper diet: As Benjamin Franklin said, “Eat to live, rather than live to\neat.” According to studies of Olympic athletes from more than 120\ncountries, the three factors their diets have in common are\n1. lean-source protein;\n2. a wide variety of fruits and vegetables; and\n3. lots of water, about eight glasses per day.\n \nWhen you begin this “Olympic diet,” you will feel more alert, awake,\nand aware all day long.\n  \n3. Proper exercise: The most important exercise for long life is aerobic\nexercise. This requires that you get your heart rate up to a high level for\nthirty to sixty minutes three times per week. You can achieve this through\nbrisk walking, running, cycling, swimming, or cross-country skiing.\n\f\nExercise physiologists have determined that the “exercise effect” clicks\nin at about twenty-five minutes of vigorous exercise. At this point, your\nbrain releases endorphins that give you a feeling of elation, or what is called\na “runner’s high.” This natural drug produced by your body can become\naddictive in a very positive way.\n \nPeople who develop the habit of regular, vigorous exercise find that it\nbecomes easier and easier to do. They begin to look forward to the feeling\nof happiness they enjoy as the result of exercising aerobically.\n  \n4. Proper rest: This is very important. More than 60 percent of adults do\nnot get enough sleep. They are suffering from what is called a “sleep\ndeficit.” They go to bed a little bit too late, sleep poorly, arise a little bit too\nearly, and go through the day in a form of “fog.” This phenomenon of not\nbeing sufficiently rested leads to poor performance, more mistakes,\nindustrial accidents, car crashes, short tempers, personality problems, and\nmany other difficulties.\n \nIf you are living and working a normal life, you require about eight hours\nof sleep each night. If you get only six or seven hours of sleep when you\nactually require eight, you begin to build up this sleep deficit. By Thursday\nor Friday, when you get up in the morning, the first thing you think of is\nhow soon you can go back to sleep again that night. When you start\nthinking about going to sleep again at the moment that you arise, you know\nthat you are not getting enough sleep.\n \nIn addition to eight hours of sleep per night, you need regular breaks\nfrom work, both weekends and vacations. When you take time off from\nwork, you allow your mental and emotional batteries to recharge. After a\ntwo- or three-day weekend, when you go back to work, you will be fully\nrested and ready to perform at your best.\n\f\n5. Proper attitude: This is perhaps the most important of all. The quality\nthat is most predictive of health, happiness, and long life is “optimism.” As\nyou become more optimistic about yourself and your life, your health will\nalso be better in every area.\n \nPeople who are positive and optimistic usually have stronger immune\nsystems, and as a result, they are seldom sick. They seldom get colds or flu.\nThey bounce back quickly from hard work or fatigue. An optimistic person\nhas a built-in “Teflon shield” against many of the diseases and ailments that\naffect the average person."

    "raw_text": "Get Your Weight Under Control\n \nThe biggest single problem with self-discipline that people have today is\novereating and becoming overweight. More than 60 percent of Americans\nare officially overweight, and more than 30 percent are obese, which is\ndefined as being more than 30 percent above their normal weight. There is\nno area in which self-discipline is more necessary than in getting your\nweight under control and then keeping it under control for the rest of your\nlife.\n \nYou have heard it said that “diets don’t work.” What this really means is\nthat when you starve yourself to lose weight, you will tend to put the weight\nback on almost as quickly as you lost it. There are many reasons for this.\n \nEach person has a certain metabolic rate. This is the rate at which you\nburn energy. This metabolic rate is set over the course of your lifetime by\nthe amount of food you eat relative to the amount of exercise you do to\nwork it off.\n \nIn addition to your metabolic rate, you have what is called a “set point.”\nThis is where your weight is set, like a thermostat, and to which it returns\nno matter how much you take off as the result of crash dieting.\n\f\nChange Your Set Point\n \nTo lose weight permanently, you must change your set point to a lower\nnumber. To achieve this, the first thing you do is to create a clear mental\nimage of how you will look when you are at your ideal weight. Get a\npicture out of a magazine of someone who has the body you want to have,\nand then paste your photo where their face appears.\n \nYou then begin a gradual process of permanently changing the quality\nand quantity of what you eat, with no intention of ever going back. Be\nprepared to work on this permanent change for at least a year. Remember, if\nyou are overweight, it has taken you many years to get to where you are\ntoday. Be prepared to invest a lot of time in getting back."

    "raw_text": "The Fatal Flaw in Dieting\n \nMany people diet and lose weight with the idea that as soon as they have\ndropped a certain number of pounds, they can reward themselves by going\nout and having a fabulous meal or consuming unlimited desserts. In other\nwords, they use the idea of filling up on food as the reward for losing\nweight in the first place. This approach is doomed to failure.\n \nInstead, set up a reward system for yourself that does not include food.\nDecide instead to buy yourself new clothes that will fit you only at your\nideal weight. Take yourself and your family on a vacation where you\nengage in fun activities. Make a bet with someone that you will take off the\nweight and keep it off for one year.\n\f\nThe Formula for Permanent Weight Loss\n \nThe key to perfect health can be summarized in five words: “Eat less and\nexercise more.”\n \nThe only way that you can lose weight permanently is to burn off more\ncalories than you consume. There is no other way. Moreover, you can do\nthis only over an extended period of time, especially if you have allowed\nyourself to put on a lot of excess weight.\n \nIn my program, “Thinking Big,” we teach the importance of avoiding the\nthree white poisons: sugar, salt, and flour.\n  \nGet Rid of Sugar. To lose weight permanently and to enjoy high levels of\nhealth and energy, you should eliminate all simple sugars from your diet.\nSimple sugars are contained in candy, cake, pastries, desserts, soft drinks,\ncanned fruits, sugar in your coffee, and all other forms of sugar that people\nconsume in large quantities every day.\n \nThe fact is that you require no additional sugar to enjoy superb levels of\nphysical health. Simply by eliminating all sugar and sugar products from\nyour life, by going “cold turkey” on sugar, you will begin to lose as much\nas one pound per day.\n\f\nPass on the Salt. In addition, you should eliminate all additional salt from\nyour diet. Although the average American gets sufficient salt in all the\ndifferent foods he eats, he consumes an extra twenty pounds of salt each\nyear by eating foods with high salt content and by then adding additional\nsalt to meals.\n \nWhen you consume excess salt, your body retains water in order to hold\nthat salt in suspension. When you stop consuming excess salt and\nsimultaneously drink eight glasses of water per day, your body releases all\nthe excess fluid and you can actually experience weight drops of as much as\nfour or five pounds in the first day.\n \nAvoid White Flour Products. Finally, eliminate all white flour products\nfrom your diet. This means all breads, pastries, pastas, buns, rolls, and\nanything else made with white flour.\n \nWhite flour is actually an “inert substance” from which all nutrients have\nbeen removed and then bleached out. When you see the words “enriched\nwhite bread,” it means that the white flour, which is essentially a dead food\nmaterial, has been fortified with artificial, chemical vitamins, almost all of\nwhich are then destroyed in the baking process. There is no food value in a\nwhite flour product.\n \nA SIMPLE CHANGE OF DIET\n \nNot long ago, I got a letter from a thirty-two-year-old man in Florida.\nHe told me that he had read my books and listened to my programs for\nyears. He had achieved a higher level of financial and career success\nthan he ever imagined possible. But he was still carrying an extra\ntwenty pounds of weight that he could not get rid of, no matter what he\ndid.\n\f\nThen one day, he listened to “Thinking Big,” and he heard my\ncomments on the three white poisons. Fortunately, he was both\ndisciplined and determined. He used his willpower to slam the brakes\non these three foods and discontinue them completely.\n \nHe said that what happened next was nothing short of miraculous.\nWithin six months, he had dropped twenty-two pounds. When he\nwrote to me, he had kept them off for two years. He said that he looked\ndifferent, felt different, was more attractive to women, and had higher\nlevels of self-confidence and self-esteem. His whole life had improved\nsince he dropped the excess weight."

    "raw_text": "Chapter 17\n \nSelf-Discipline and Physical Fitness\n \n“Mental toughness is many things and rather difficult to explain. Its\nqualities are sacrifice and self denial. Also, and most importantly, it is\ncombined with a perfectly disciplined will that refuses to give in. It is a\nstate of mind that you could call character in action.”\n—VINCE LOMBARDI\n \n \n \n \nFor you to achieve and maintain high levels of physical fitness requires a\nlifetime of self-discipline and willpower. The good news is that physical\nfitness is its own reward. Not only do you feel good while you are\nexercising, but you feel wonderful about yourself the rest of the time.\n \nIf your goal is to live a long, healthy, happy life and be fit and trim\nphysically, there is no substitute for regular exercise. Fortunately, you do\nnot have to train for the Olympics or a triathlon to enjoy superb levels of\nphysical well-being. By building exercise and physical training into your\ndaily routine you can achieve physical fitness just by making a few small\nmodifications to your lifestyle.\n\f\nListen to the Experts\n \nPhysical fitness specialists generally agree that you need to exercise 200-\n300 minutes per week to enjoy the maximum levels of physical well-being\nthat are possible for you. This means that you need to exercise between\nthirty and sixty minutes, five to seven times each week.\n \nAt the low end, if you simply went for a thirty-minute walk each morning\nbefore you started off for work or each evening when you got home from\nwork as well as each weekend day, you would be one of the healthiest\npeople in our society.\n \nIf you increase your exercise level to sixty minutes each time, five times\nper week, you will be in the top 1 or 2 percent of physically fit people in the\nworld today.\n\f\nGet Started First Thing\n \nThe best time to exercise is first thing in the morning. People who get up\neach morning and exercise for thirty to sixty minutes are much more likely\nto make exercise a permanent part of their daily routine.\n \nOn the other hand, people who put off exercising until later in the day,\nuntil after work, almost invariably find that they are too tired or have too\nmany other things to do.\n \nThey procrastinate on exercising until another day, which often never\ncomes.\n \nIt takes tremendous discipline to get into and follow a regular exercise\nroutine. But it is easier if you can discipline yourself to get up in the\nmorning and start exercising immediately.\n\f\nTrick Yourself\n \nMany people, including myself, trick themselves into exercising in the\nmorning by putting their exercise clothes right next to the bed so that they\ntrip over them when they get up. Before they are even awake, they find\nthemselves pulling on their exercise clothes and running shoes and starting\noff around the block. Before they even know what has happened, they are\nhalfway into their exercise routine, their heart rate is up, their lungs are\npuffing away, and they are feeling good about themselves.\n \nWhenever people come back from a morning run or any other form of\nmorning exercise, they are always happy and smiling. This is because of the\n“exercise effect” that kicks in after twenty-five or thirty minutes. Their\nbrains release endorphins and they feel exhilarated."

    "raw_text": "Increase Your Intelligence\n \nPeople who engage in aerobic exercise first thing in the morning have been\nshown to be brighter, more creative, and more intelligent throughout the\nday. They actually score higher on intelligence tests, and they seem to\ncome up with more ideas to help them do their work better during the\ncourse of the day.\n \nThe reason for this is obvious. When you engage in aerobic exercise first\nthing in the morning, you drive hyper-oxygenated blood into your cerebral\ncortex, the part of your brain that you use for thinking, analyzing, and\ndecision making. This makes you wide-awake and alert from first thing in\nthe morning and then for several hours afterward.\n \nWhen you exercise as soon as you get up, you kick your metabolic rate\ninto a higher gear. As a result, your body continues to burn calories all day\nlong. You continue to lose weight for several hours after exercising.\n \nWhen you exercise first thing in the morning or anytime during the day,\nyou become hungry. However, because you are working out your body in\nsuch a healthy way, you will have a natural appetite for healthy foods. You\nwill have little or no desire for sweet foods or desserts.\n\f\nMake Exercise a Part of Your Lifestyle\n \nOne of the best things you can do to achieve and maintain high levels of\nphysical fitness is to join a gym or a health club and attend regular exercise\nclasses. You can even pay a little more and get yourself a personal trainer\nwho puts you through an exercise regimen three or more times each week.\n \nYou are much more likely to discipline yourself to start and maintain a\nfitness routine if you have someone who is expecting you to be at a class or\nmonitoring you on a regular basis to make sure that you follow the exercise\nprogram to which you committed.\n \nMany people today are hiring personal trainers. Either a personal trainer\ncan come to your home or place of work or you can go to a gym that has\npersonal trainers on staff who will work with you on the specific equipment\nyou want to use.\n \nPeople who use personal trainers are almost universally delighted with\nthe results. They find that being accountable to a trainer exerts a positive\ninfluence on them, causing them to eat less so they have less weight to burn\noff and to work harder when they exercise so that they can earn the\napproval of the trainer.\n\f\nJoin an Organized Sport\n \nOrganized sports are a wonderful way to achieve and maintain high levels\nof physical fitness. They are far more demanding in terms of time and\nschedule, but the payoff is often extraordinary.\n \nIf you are a member of a sports league—whether that be baseball, tennis,\nfootball, soccer, racquetball, or anything else—and you have a coach or\ntrainer that you work with on a regular basis, you tend to be more focused\nand disciplined. You will exercise more often and more vigorously, and you\nwill be fitter and trimmer than most other people."

    "raw_text": "Develop New and Better Habits\n \nUnfortunately, physical fitness and sports training require such high levels\nof discipline, and few people are capable of starting and continuing this\nkind of exercise regimen. For better or worse, whatever you do repeatedly\nbecomes a habit, and many people get out of the habit of regular exercise\nand never go back.\n \nFortunately, it is never too late. At any time, you can decide that you are\ngoing to enjoy high levels of physical fitness. You can make a decision,\nright now, to start a physical fitness routine of some kind and then set it as a\npersonal test or challenge to see if you have the willpower and discipline to\nfollow through on your resolution.\n \nYOU CAN START TODAY\n \nSome years ago, there was a sixty-eight-year-old woman living in a\nsenior citizens’ home who had never given much thought to physical\nexercise. She had worked hard, raised her family, become a\ngrandmother, and was now living comfortably in a senior citizens’\nresidence.\n \nOne day, she saw a television special on jogging. During this\nspecial, they interviewed a couple of people in their fifties and sixties\nwho were running marathons. Some of them had started running later\nin life.\n\f\nThis sixty-eight-year-old woman decided that she wanted to run a\nmarathon as well. She drove down to a nearby store and bought the\nproper shoes for walking and running. That day, she began her exercise\nregimen by walking around the neighborhood where she lived. Over\nthe next few weeks, she walked ever-greater distances. She bought\nbooks and sought advice on how to exercise and train her legs for\nrunning.\n  \n \nBUILD UP GRADUALLY\n \nAfter two months, she began jogging a little as part of her walking\nroutine. After six months, she began running as part of her walking\nand jogging routine. By the end of the first year, she had run in a mini-\nmarathon in her local community.\n \nBy the time she was seventy-five, she had completed ten 26.4-mile\nmarathons and two fifty-mile cross-country marathons. And the most\nremarkable thing was that she had never run before the age of sixty-\neight.\n \nSo what’s your excuse? If this sixty-eight-year-old woman could start\nexercising so late in life, why can’t you?\n \nOne of the greatest guarantors that you will live a long, happy life, being\nbright, alert, and full of energy, is that you begin a regular physical training\nprogram, four or five days per week, and continue it for the rest of your life.\n \nWhen you exert your self-discipline and willpower to achieve a high\nlevel of physical fitness and then maintain it year after year, you will feel\nterrific about yourself."

    "raw_text": "The Key to a Happy Marriage\n \nPerhaps the most important reason for a happy marriage is compatibility.\nThe two people are ideally balanced with each other, with each one\npossessing complementary qualities and characteristics that combine\ncomfortably to form a perfect balance.\n \nPeople often say that “opposites attract.” This is a misunderstanding.\nOpposites attract in only one area, and that is temperament. You will\nalways be most compatible with a person who has an opposite or\ncounterbalancing temperament to your own.\n \nFor example, if you are outgoing and extroverted, you will be most\ncompatible with a person who is more reserved and self-contained. If you\nare voluble and expressive, you will be most compatible with a person who\nis relaxed and a good listener. Nature demands a balance in temperament\nfor two people to be compatible and happy together.\n\f\nBirds of a Feather\n \nIn all other areas, especially in the area of values, it is similarities that\nattract. Birds of a feather do flock together. You will always be attracted to\npeople and most compatible with those who have the greatest number of\nfundamental values in common with yourself.\n \nAll of love, of any kind, is a response to value. We love what we most\nvalue, both in ourselves and others. When a couple is truly happy together,\nthey seem to have very much the same values regarding family, money,\nethics, work, children, politics, religion, and people.\n \nPeople will often point out that there are happy couples who vote for\ndifferent parties or come from different religious backgrounds. But the\ncritical issue in balance and harmony revolves around the intensity with\nwhich a person values something. This intensity determines if a person is\nabsolute and unbending or relaxed and flexible in his or her adherence to a\nparticular belief about a particular part of life.\n \nPeople can love and live together happily for many years even though\nthey support different political parties, as long as political belief is not so\nimportant to either of them that it takes precedence over more important\nelements of their relationship such as children, family, and values.\n\f\nLove Is Our Greatest Need in Life\n \nIt is said that “everything we do in life is either to get love, or to\ncompensate for a lack of love.” Psychologists generally agree that the root\ncause of personality problems in adult life can be traced back to “love\nwithheld” in infancy and childhood.\n \nPeople need love like roses need rain. Without sufficient love and\nacceptance, individuals exhibit all kinds of personality and physical\nproblems. It is only possible to be happy when your needs for love are\ncompletely fulfilled.\n \nA happy marriage requires tremendous self-discipline and self-control.\nLove requires self-denial and sacrifice. When you are truly in love with\nanother person, that person’s happiness and well-being become more\nimportant than your own. You are willing to pay whatever price and make\nwhatever sacrifice in order to ensure the well-being of the person you love.\n \nIn the Christian Bible, in a letter to the Corinthians, the apostle Paul says,\n“Love suffereth long, and is kind; love envieth not; love avengeth not itself,\nis not puffed up.\n \n“Love doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not his own, is not easily\nprovoked, thinketh no evil;\n \n“Love rejoices not in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth;\n\f\n“Love beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth\nall things. Love never fails.”\n\f\nDifferent Strokes Require Tolerance and Understanding\n \nEach person is an individual, with unique and special characteristics that\nmake him or her different from all other people. Each person has different\nideas, tastes, desires, hopes, dreams, and expectations. Each person has had\ndifferent experiences and developed different ways of seeing and dealing\nwith the world around him or her.\n \nWhen you come together with another person in a loving relationship, no\nmatter how close you feel to each other and no matter how compatible you\nmay be in many ways, you will still have areas of disagreement,\ndissatisfaction, and discontent. This is normal and natural and something to\nbe worked through by practicing self-discipline and self-control whenever\nthese differences occur.\n \nSelf-discipline in a relationship requires that you be completely honest\nand open, that you be yourself and never try to be someone or something\nelse. Self-discipline and honesty require that you state clearly what you are\nthinking and feeling, without anger or irritation, and that you listen calmly\nand patiently to the feelings, thoughts, and opinions of the other person.\n\f\nMale-Female Communication Styles\n \nMen and women are different in many ways. According to MRI scans,\nwhen men communicate, they use only two centers of their brains. When\nwomen communicate, they use seven centers of their brains. It is as though\nmen have two headlights with which to communicate, whereas a woman’s\nbrain is like a fully lit Christmas tree.\n \nMen can process only one sensory input at a time, whereas women can\nprocess multiple sensory inputs. When a man is watching television, he\ndoes not see or hear anything else, including words spoken to him from the\nside or behind. He becomes totally fixated on the visual images and words\non the screen.\n \nWhen a man is driving a car, he has to turn down the radio to read the\nmap. He has to turn down the television or radio to answer the telephone.\nHe cannot read and listen or watch at the same time. Men can do many\nthings extremely well, but they can do only one thing at a time. Men tend to\nbe very focused.\n \nWomen, on the other hand, can talk, make dinner, watch television, read\nthe day’s mail, and talk to her children or husband all at once. They are\nmultidimensional and can process several inputs simultaneously. They can\ntalk and listen at the same time and be aware of what other people around\nthem are doing and saying.\n \nWomen are relationship experts. They are very sensitive to other people.\nWhen a man and a woman attend a social gathering, within ten minutes, the"

    "raw_text": "woman will have done an analysis and assessment of the situation of each\nof the other people in the room. In contrast, the man accompanying the\nwoman will have noticed little or nothing. This is because men are simple\nand straightforward in their thinking, whereas women are complex, aware\nof small details, and extremely sensitive to the dynamics and nuances of the\nrelationships of the people around them.\n \nA man can call his wife on the phone and say, “Hello.” Although she has\nonly heard one word, she will immediately ask, “What’s wrong?” She can\npick up a wealth of meaning and emotion from a single word on the phone\nor a single glance or look when he walks in the door.\n\f\nRelationship-Building Takes Effort\n \nBecause of the many differences between men and women, it takes\ntremendous discipline to build and maintain a long-term, loving, and happy\nrelationship.\n \nPerhaps the most important area of mutual compatibility has to do with\nthe discipline of listening. It is only when two people take the time to listen\nclosely and carefully to each other when they speak that the lines of\ncommunications stay open, and this is when love and harmony continue in\nthe relationship.\n \nThere are four simple disciplines of effective listening. They are mostly\nof importance to men, who are notoriously poor listeners, especially with\nthe women in their lives. This is not because they are not interested. It is\nsimply because their minds are focused on something else and they are\neasily distracted.\n\f\nThe Disciplines of Listening\n \nListen Attentively. The first discipline is to listen attentively , without\ninterrupting. Listen as though the other person is about to reveal a great\nsecret or the winning lottery number and you will hear it only once.\n \nWhen she wants to talk to you, if you are a man, put aside all possible\ndistractions. Turn off the television or radio. Put down the newspaper or\nmail. Face her directly, lean slightly forward, and concentrate single-\nmindedly on what she is saying.\n \nThe book His Needs, Her Needs points out that the most important need\nthat a woman has from a man is affection. Affection is expressed by paying\ntotal attention to her when she speaks. Since you always pay attention to\nwhat you most value, when you pay close attention to another person while\nshe speaks, you tell that person that she is of great value to you. This\nsatisfies the deepest subconscious needs of a woman—to feel valuable,\nimportant, and respected.\n  \nPause before Replying. The second discipline of listening is to pause\nbefore replying. Take a few seconds to carefully consider what he or she has\nsaid. When you pause, you avoid the risk of interrupting the other person if\nshe is just reformulating her thoughts. You tell her that you value what she\nsaid and that you are giving her words careful consideration.\n \nAnother advantage of pausing, of allowing a silence in the conversation,\nis that it enables you to hear not only what was said, but also what was not\n\f\nsaid or what was said between the lines. The actual message soaks into a\ndeeper level of your mind, enabling you to understand better and to\ntherefore respond with greater awareness and sensitivity.\n  \nAsk for Clarification. The third discipline of effective listening is to\nquestion for clarification. Never assume that you automatically know what\nthe other person is thinking or feeling. Instead, if you are at all unclear,\nsimply ask, “How do you mean?” or “How do you mean, exactly?”\n \nIt is when you ask questions and seek clarity and meaning that you\ndemonstrate to the other person that you really care about what he or she is\nsaying, and that you are genuinely interested in understanding how he or\nshe thinks and feels.\n  \nFeed It Back. The fourth discipline of effective listening is for you to feed\nback what the other person has said, and paraphrase it in your own words.\nThis is the “acid test” of listening. This is where you demonstrate to the\nother person that you were genuinely paying attention. It is only when you\ncan repeat back what the other person has just said, in your own words, that\nyou prove to him or her that you were really listening.\n \nMost problems in relationships arise because of poor communication.\nThe couple does not talk together often enough or one or the other does not\nlisten attentively when the other wants to speak.\n \nEach person has an emotional need to talk a certain amount with his or\nher spouse. Each person also has an emotional need to listen a certain\namount. The most compatible couples are those in whom the desire to talk\nand listen are in balance with each other. There is an easy ebb and flow of\nconversation, punctuated with comfortable silences. Each person gets a\n\f\nchance to fulfill his or her need for both talking and listening, and both\nparties are content."

    "raw_text": "Total Commitment Is Essential\n \nLove and marriage require total commitment on the part of both people. It\ntakes tremendous discipline to go “all in” in a relationship. What’s more,\nthis is also tremendously liberating. It is only when you are totally\ncommitted to a relationship with a single person that you are completely\nfree to turn your attention toward fulfilling your potential in the other\naspects of your life.\n \nOne of the most important disciplines in a marriage or relationship is that\nof faithfulness. Because we live in a highly sexualized society, there are\ntemptations and provocations around us all the time and virtually\neverywhere we go. It often takes considerable self-discipline and self-\ncontrol to be completely loyal to your spouse throughout your married life.\n \nThere are two ways to help you avoid the regular temptations that can\ndamage or even destroy the most loving of relationships.\n \nFirst, make a decision, in advance, that you will never, never be\nunfaithful to your spouse. Like drawing a line in the sand, make the\ndecision in advance that no matter what happens, you will not stray for any\nreason.\n \nSecond, discipline yourself to stay out of harm’s way. Refuse to go\nanywhere or do anything where temptation may exist. Except when\nessential for business purposes, avoid having lunch, drinks, or dinner alone\nwith a member of the opposite sex. Remember, there is safety in crowds.\n\f\nContinually imagine, everywhere you go and in everything you do, that\nyour spouse is standing right next to you, watching and listening to what\nyou say and do. Imagine that anything and everything you do, no matter\nwhere you are, is going to be reported back to your spouse within twenty-\nfour hours. Use your discipline and willpower to build and maintain a\nreputation for being a completely honest and faithful spouse.\n\f\nBe Willing to Change\n \nEvery marriage is a “work in progress.” As time passes, the nature of your\nmarriage will change, usually in positive and constructive ways.\n \nTo keep your relationship happy, harmonious, and growing, you must be\nwilling to change in response to changing circumstances, especially having\nchildren and watching them grow up. You need to be prepared to change\nwith age, new jobs and careers, physical moves from one part of the country\nto another, changes in financial circumstances, and changes in health.\nFlexibility is absolutely essential to a long, happy marriage.\n \nThere are only four ways that you can change your life. First, you can do\nmore of some things. Second, you can do less of other things. Third, you\ncan start something that you have never done before. And fourth, you can\nstop certain things altogether. Whenever you are experiencing resistance or\nfrustration or you are confronted with the need for change, ask yourself, “Is\nthere anything that I need to do more of, less of, start, or stop doing?”"

Is there anything that I am doing that you would like me to do\nmore of?\n2. Is there anything that I am doing that you would like me to do\nless of?\n3. Is there anything that you would like me to start doing that I am\nnot doing today?\n4. Is there anything that I am doing that you would like me to stop\ndoing altogether?\n \nWhen you have the courage and discipline to ask these questions of your\nspouse and your children on a regular basis, you will be amazed at the\nquality and depth of the answers you receive. You will get continual\nguidance on how you can modify and adjust your behaviors to maintain\nhigher levels of harmony, happiness, and love with your spouse and the\nother members of your family.\n\f\nYour Spouse Should Be Your Best Friend\n \nLove and marriage are perhaps the most important elements of a happy,\nfulfilling life. They require a lifelong exercise of self-discipline and\nwillpower to create and maintain harmony. They require that you be open,\nhonest, and candid at all times.\n \nMost of all, a happy, a loving marriage requires that you see your spouse\nas your best friend. There should be no one in the world who you would\nrather spend time with more than him or her. There should be no one with\nwhom you are more open and honest than with him or her. When you see\nyour spouse as your best friend and treat him or her as such, you can create\na loving relationship that lasts all the days of your lives.\n \nAs Emmet Fox, a spiritual writer and teacher, wrote,\nLove is by far the most important thing of all. It casts out fear. It is the\nfulfilling of the law. It covers a multitude of sins. Love is absolutely\ninvincible.\n \nThere is no difficulty that enough love will not cure; no disease that\nenough love will not heal; no door that enough love will not open; no\ngulf that enough love will not bridge; no wall that enough love will not\nthrow down; no sin that enough love will not redeem.\n \nIt makes no difference how deeply seated may be the trouble, how\nhopeless the outlook, how muddled the tangle, how great the mistake;\na sufficient realization of love will dissolve it all."

    "raw_text": "Chapter 19\n \nSelf-Discipline and Children\n \n“Right discipline exists, not in external compulsion, but in habits of\nmind which lead spontaneously to desirable rather than undesirable\nactivities.”\n—BERTRAND RUSSELL\n \n \n \n \nYou can calculate the value or importance of something you do by\nmeasuring the possible consequences of doing or not doing it. Something\nthat is important is something that has significant potential consequences,\nlike jumping out of the path of a speeding car. Bringing children into the\nworld has consequences that can go on for eighty years (which is the\naverage life expectancy of a person today) and beyond, into the lives of\nyour grandchildren and great grandchildren. This is why becoming a parent\nis one of the most important things you will ever do.\n \nAs an adult, you are still affected today by things that your grandparents\ndid or didn’t do to or for your parents. The way you treat your children is\nstrongly influenced by the way your parents treated you. It has\nconsequences that cascade down the generations, and it has an enormous\ninfluence on their lifelong happiness and well-being.\n\f\nYour Greatest Responsibility\n \nWhen you have a child, a high level of self-discipline is essential in order to\nfulfill your commitment and deliver on your responsibility. The day your\nfirst child is born, you have taken on a minimum twenty-year commitment\nto do everything possible to raise your child as a happy, healthy, and self-\nconfident adult.\n \nAt every stage of your child’s life, your words, actions, nonactions, and\nbehaviors are shaping and influencing that child and determining how he or\nshe will turn out as an adult.\n \nThe greatest need that a child has is for an unbroken flow of\nunconditional love and acceptance from his or her parents. Children need\nlove almost as much as they need oxygen. The amount of love that a child\nreceives, especially in his or her formative years, is the critical determinant\nof how healthy and happy he or she becomes as an adult.\n\f\nHow Children Spell “Love”\n \nHow does a child spell “love”? T-I-M-E. Children determine how valuable\nand important they are and develop their self-esteem and self-worth by\nmeasuring the amount of time that the most important people in their lives\nspend with them when they are young. There is no substitute for time, and\nonce gone, you cannot make it up. Perhaps the greatest regret reported by\nparents is that “I didn’t spend enough time with my child when he or she\nwas young.”\n \nWhen you become a parent, you must discipline yourself and organize\nyour life so you can spend ample time with your child throughout his or her\ngrowing years. You must discipline yourself to cut back, reduce, downsize,\nand eliminate other activities that prevent you from being an excellent\nparent.\n \nA WAKE-UP CALL\n \nSome years ago, a good friend of mine got married. He was an avid\ngolfer, and he regularly played golf five times a week, often flying\nsouth in the winter for golf vacations when his local golf courses were\ncovered with snow.\n \nWithin four years of marrying, he and his wife had four children.\nNonetheless, he still tried to play golf several times a week, taking\ntime off from his business during the week and playing on weekends.\n\f\nFinally, his wife confronted him and told him that he was not\nspending enough time with his young children. His golf was taking up\ntoo many hours that would be better spent at home with her and with\nthe children, especially during their most vulnerable and sensitive\nyears.\n \nHe suddenly realized that his life had changed. The things that he\ncould do when he was single were no longer possible when he had\nyoung children. Being highly responsible and self-disciplined, he\nimmediately cut back his golf to once per week and rechanneled his\ntime and energy into his family. He told me later that it made an\nextraordinary difference to his marriage and to his relationships with\nhis young children.\n\f\nSetting New Priorities\n \nWhen you get married, your life goes though a major shift. Your lifestyle\nchanges, and many of your common activities lose their importance and\nurgency.\n \nWhen your first child is born, your life shifts again. It often feels as if the\nfirst stage of your life—your youth—has dropped off, like the first stage of\na rocket, and you are now on a different trajectory in life. In fact, it is not\nuncommon for couples to change their lives completely when their first\nchild is born. They cut back or discontinue many of their previous social\nactivities. They stop dining and drinking with friends, and they stop going\nout socially on the weekends.\n \nThey begin to build a different life together around their home and\nchildren. The children become the focus of their time and attention. The\nchildren become the primary subject of their conversations.\n \nResponsible parents approach childrearing as the most important part of\ntheir lives. They plan and organize their time and activities so they can\nfulfill this responsibility at a high level.\n\f\nLong-Term Thinking\n \nChildren force you to think long-term. When you realize that everything\nthat you do or fail to do with your children in their formative years will\nhave a lasting impact for generations to come, you become far more\nthoughtful and sensitive to the things you say and the way you treat them.\n \nWhen you are young and single, you can “let it all hang out.” You can\nblow up, get angry, express your feelings freely, and “be your own person.”\nBut when you have a child, you need to impose a higher level of discipline\nand self-control on yourself.\n \nChildren are hypersensitive to the influence of their parents during their\nformative years. They see and experience each word and reaction of their\nparents, and they incorporate those words and actions into their world view\nand self-image.\n \nIn almost every case, when you see a dysfunctional adult, you can trace it\nback to dysfunctional parenting. When that dysfunctional adult was a child,\ntheir parents did or said things to them that hurt them, confused them,\nscared them, and created within them feelings of insecurity, anger, and\ninferiority.\n\f\nThe Greatest Gift Is Love\n \nThe greatest gift you can give children is to let them know that you love\nthem 100 percent of the time and that your love for them never changes, no\nmatter what happens.\n \nThere is no greater blessing for children than to know with complete\nconfidence that the most important people in their life—their parents—love\nthem completely and accept them totally, no matter what they do or what\nmistakes they make.\n \nChildren are not little adults. They do not have the ability to make good\njudgments about the right or wrong things to do. It takes them many years\nof trial and error and sometimes bitter experience to develop the wisdom\nand judgment that enable them to make good decisions for themselves and\ntheir futures.\n \nThe kindest way to treat your children when they make mistakes is to\nbehave with calmness and compassion and to help them learn the lessons\ncontained in the problem or difficulty.\n\f\nDiscipline Versus Development\n \nMany parents think that their job is to discipline their children by punishing\nthem when they make a mistake. Back in the 1930s, when my parents were\ngrowing up, it was generally taught that the job of the parent was to “break\nthe will of the child.” This philosophy led to a generation of broken\nchildren whose parents felt that it was their duty to mold them and shape\nthem into little people that their parents found to be acceptable.\n \nBut the fact is that each child is unique and different from all other\npeople in the world. Each child comes into this world with his or her unique\ntemperament, personality, and natural leanings toward different interests\nand activities.\n \nParents are often amazed to see that each of their children is very\ndifferent from each other child, even though they come from the same\nparents and grow up in the same household. In my experience, each child\n“marches to the beat of a different drummer.”\n \nNo matter what you do to or for them, they have their own special\ndestiny. They are going to grow up with a particular personality, and they\nwill be attracted to particular people and activities. Your main job is to\ncreate an environment in which they feel safe and confident enough to\nfollow their inner promptings and personal inclinations."

    "raw_text": "Question Your Beliefs\n \nA philosopher once said, “Before I had children, I had four philosophies\nabout raising children. Now, I have four children, and no philosophies.”\n \nEach child is different from any other child and from any other person.\nWhen raising your children, be prepared to question your most cherished\nbeliefs about what they “should” or “should not” do, say, or be. Above all,\nbe prepared to admit that you could be wrong, because you are going to\nmake more mistakes than you can imagine.\n \nPerhaps the most important responsibility you have as a parent is to\ninstill values in your children, especially the value of self-discipline. One of\nthe most common desires that parents have for their children is to raise\nthem with a sense of self-responsibility and self-control. Parents want their\nchildren to be self-disciplined and to practice self-mastery and self-denial,\nor the ability to delay gratification.\n\f\nSet a Good Example\n \nAlbert Schweitzer once wrote, “You must teach men at the school of\nexample, for they will learn at no other.”\n \nThe most powerful influence you have on your children is the example\nthat you set for them all the time that they are growing up. Your children are\nalways watching you out of the corners of their eyes or from another room.\nThey take everything in. They measure and analyze your behaviors,\nespecially when you are under stress. By watching the way you behave,\nespecially when you are angry or upset or when they have made a mistake,\nthey develop a clear picture for themselves of how adults are supposed to\nbehave in the world.\n \nYour example sets the standard that they consider to be the normal way\nthat adults act in various circumstances, especially when under stress. Your\nchildren, if they admire and respect your example, will strive to emulate\nyou while they are growing up and then continuing on for the rest of their\nlives.\n \nPerhaps the best question you can ask yourself, over and over, is, “What\nkind of a family would my family be if everyone in it were just like me?”\n\f\nBe a Role Model\n \nWhen you practice self-discipline and self-control, especially when you feel\nangry or upset, your children absorb the lesson. Later, when they are angry\nor upset, they will practice self-discipline and self-control as well.\n \nIn a recent study, researchers concluded that children form their idea of\nthe world by watching how their mother deals with the ups and downs of\ndaily life. If their mother seems calm, relaxed, and in control, children\nassume that this is a logical and rational world so they are much more likely\nto practice calmness and self-control themselves.\n \nIf their mother seems to be frustrated, angry, or overwhelmed by too\nmuch to do and too little time, children absorb the world view that life is\nconfused and stressful."

    "raw_text": "Building Character\n \nThe most important job you have as a parent is to instill values and to build\ncharacter in your children. You do this by teaching them what values are\nimportant, especially those of integrity and truth telling. You set yourself up\nas a role model and demonstrate the values you want your children to have\nin every situation where those values are called for.\n \nBecause the core value of character is integrity, the most important value\nthat you instill in your children is truthfulness. Much to the shock of most\nparents, children lie. When they are growing up, they don’t tell the truth.\nThey tell both little and big lies. Often, this comes as a surprise to parents\nwho feel that somehow they must have failed their children in some way.\n \nBut don’t worry: Lying is a normal and natural part of childhood. It is a\nform of communication that children are trying out on you to see if it\nworks. If children find that telling lies is an effective way to get the things\nthey want quickly and easily, they will lie on a regular basis.\n \nFor example, I once asked my son Michael a question, and he gave me an\nanswer that I knew was completely untrue. I asked him, “Michael, why did\nyou say that? You know that that’s a barefaced lie!” Michael, who was ten\nyears old at the time, answered candidly, “Well, I just thought I’d give it a\ntry.”\n \nChildren will give lying a try to see if it works. If it doesn’t, they will try\nsomething else, and that something else is usually telling the truth."

    "raw_text": "Always Tell the Truth\n \nOne day, my wife and I read a question in a book on child raising, which\nsaid, “If your children lie to you, who has made them afraid to tell the\ntruth?”\n \nThat was a real eye-opener for us. We immediately sat down with our\nchildren and told them, “From now on, always tell the truth. We promise\nyou that you will never get into trouble for telling the truth. If you tell a lie,\nwe will be upset and you will be punished. But if you tell the truth, you will\nalways be okay with us.”\n \nFrom that day onward, with few exceptions, our children “tried us out”\nwith the truth. Over time, they got into a habit of telling the truth, no matter\nwhat it was. And we kept our promise. We never punished our children for\ntelling the truth.\n \nOne day, as we were sitting around the family dinner table, one of our\nchildren was talking about his friend who had told him to lie to us about\nsomething he was planning to do.\n \nMy son said, “I told him that I never lie to my parents.”\n \nHis friend said, “Everyone lies to their parents.”\n\f\nMy son repeated, “I never lie to my parents, because I don’t have to. I\ncan always tell them the truth and everything will be okay.”\n \nOur three children listened to this, and they all agreed. They told us that\nthis was a great family because they never had to lie to their parents.\n\f\nThe Foundation of Self-Confidence\n \nWhen children tell the truth, they grow up straight and strong, with high\nself-esteem and high levels of self-confidence. They have higher levels of\nself-respect and personal pride. They look you straight in the eye and tell\nyou exactly what they are thinking and feeling. They are very different from\nchildren who must continually lie or shade the truth in order to get things\npast their parents.\n \nIn raising your children, there will be countless times when they will do\nor say something which you disapprove of or which makes you angry.\nDuring these times you must discipline yourself to think before you act, or\nreact, controlling yourself and your temper. You must remind yourself that\nwhat you do in a moment of stress is registered and recorded by your child\nand can have an effect on him or her for an indefinite period into the future.\n \nChildren learn values by teaching and example, given to them repeatedly\nwhile they’re growing up. When you teach them values and personally\npractice the values of love—especially for your spouse—compassion for\nthose who are less fortunate, generosity with those who need it, patience\nwhen it is required, tolerance for different viewpoints, courage in the face of\ndifficulties, and perseverance in the face of setbacks, your children will\nadopt these behaviors as norms. They will see them as the appropriate way\nto respond to these kinds of situations as they grow up."

    "raw_text": "The Power of Forgiveness\n \nOne of the most important of all values that you teach your children is\nforgiveness. The inability to forgive lies at the root of most negative\nemotions. When you practice forgiveness, when you freely let things go,\nyour children grow up with the ability to forgive as well. This saves them\nfrom years of unhappiness as the result of someone hurting them in some\nway, which will always happen.\n \nMy parents were adamant and inflexible. They had low self-esteem as the\nresult of difficult Depression-era childhoods. As a result, once they had\ntaken a position on any subject, however wrong, they could never back\ndown and admit that they were wrong.\n \nI resolved that when I had children, I would do exactly the opposite.\nFrom the time my daughter Christina was a little girl, if I shouted at her for\nany reason, I would always go to her and apologize. I would say, “I should\nnot have shouted at you. I was wrong. Will you forgive me?”\n \nWhen you raise children, they will make countless mistakes while they\nare growing up. Sometimes you will overreact. Unless you are a saint, this\nis almost impossible for you not to do. However, whenever you make a\nmistake with your child, you should have the courage and compassion to\nrealize that destructive criticism from a parent is extremely painful to a\nchild. Go and take it back. Apologize and ask your child for forgiveness.\nEven if the child has misbehaved, this does not justify reacting in a negative\nand hurtful way toward your child. Just say, “I apologize. Will you forgive\nme?”\n\f\nAnd they always will. The minute you apologize and ask your children to\nforgive you for anything that you may have done to hurt them, you liberate\nthem from feelings of negativity or inferiority. By taking it back, you allow\nthem to be happy and confident once more."

    "raw_text": "Teaching Your Children Is Never Ending\n \nDeveloping proper values and teaching proper conduct to your children is a\nlifelong job. You cannot give a single lecture on truthfulness and\ncompassion and then forget about it. You must repeat the lesson by\ndiscussion and example over and over, year after year, all the time while\nyour children are with you.\n \nIn a letter to Miss Manners, a parent asked, “How long does it take to\nteach my children table manners? No matter what I say, it seems that my\nchildren still eat in an un-mannered and disorganized way.” Miss Manners\nresponded by saying, “Be patient. It takes about fifteen years of continual\nrepetition to teach your children table manners. And even then, there are no\nguarantees that your instruction will be successful.”\n\f\nBe Their Role Model\n \nOf course, if you want your children to behave in a certain way, you must\nmodel that method of behavior continually, year after year. If you want your\nchildren to dress properly, you must dress properly. If you want your\nchildren to groom themselves properly, you must groom yourself properly\nas well. If you want your children to be organized and efficient, you must\nshow them the way by being organized and efficient yourself.\n \nRemember each day that your children are going to behave the way that\nyou behave for the rest of their lives. When you think like this, it forces you\nto practice higher levels of self-discipline and self-control, knowing that the\nconsequences of your behaviors are going to affect your children’s chances\nin life many years from now.\n \nThe discipline of raising children so that they grow up with high self-\nesteem, being positive and confident in themselves and their own value, is\none of the most important things you ever do. The results of your\nchildrearing will last you all the years of your life.\n  \nAction Exercises:\n 1. What two qualities would you like your children to\nidentify with you by observing your behavior?\n2. What two qualities would you like most to instill in your\nchildren, and how could you achieve this?\n\f\n3. If you were an excellent role model for your children, how\nwould your behaviors be different, starting today?\n4. What mistakes have your children made that you should\nforgive and forget about, starting immediately?\n5. What actions are you going to take immediately to spend\nmore time with your children?\n6. What actions could you take to instill the quality of\ntruthfulness in your children?\n7. How could you encourage and reward your children so\nthat they practice greater self-discipline, self-control, and self-\nmastery?\n\f\nChapter 20\n \nSelf-Discipline and Friendship\n \n“Everything you want in life has a price connected to it. There is a\nprice to pay if you want to make things better, a price to pay for\nleaving things as they are, a price for everything.”\n—HARRY BROWNE\n \n \n \n \nFully 85 percent of your happiness will come from happy relationships with\nother people. Unfortunately, fully 85 percent of your problems and\nunhappiness will be associated with other people as well. Chapters 18 and\n19 offered some ideas on how to have a happier marriage and raise happier\nchildren, but in addition to your family, of course, your friendships are also\nimportant to your well-being.\n \nIt therefore behooves you to become absolutely excellent at human\nrelations. Fortunately, this is a learnable skill. You can become one of the\nmost popular people in your work and social circle by simply engaging in\nthe behaviors that other popular people practice on a regular basis.\n \nAristotle wrote that man is a social animal. This means that we define\nourselves in terms of our relationships with other people. Our destinies are\ndetermined by our interactions with others and theirs with us. We learn who\nwe are and know about ourselves only through interacting with other\npeople."

    "raw_text": "The Core of Personality\n \nPsychologists tell us that everything we do is either to build our self-esteem\nor to protect it from being torn down by other people. Each person is\nhypersensitive about his or her own sense of personal value and importance.\n \nYour self-esteem—how you feel about yourself, how much you like\nyourself—is largely determined by your self-image, or the way you see and\nthink about yourself. Your self-image is made up of three parts, like the\nthree wedges of a pie, each touching the others:\n1. First, your self-image is made up of the way you see yourself.\nThis largely determines the way you walk, talk, behave, and interact\nwith others.\n2. The second part of your self-image is the way you think others\nsee you. If you think other people like, respect, and admire you, you\nsee yourself in a positive way and you enjoy higher feelings of self-\nesteem and self-importance.\n3. The third part of your self-image is the way people actually do\nsee you and treat you. If you think you are well liked and popular and\nsomeone treats you in a rude or disrespectful way, it can be a shock to\nyour self-image and lower your self-esteem. On the other hand, if you\nsee yourself as an average person, and the people you meet treat you as\nthough you are a valuable and important person, you can experience a\npositive shock to your self-image that causes you to like and value\nyourself even more.\n\f\nThe Key to Happiness\n \nYou are truly happy only when you feel that all three parts of your self-\nimage coincide. You are happy only when you feel that the way you see\nyourself, the way you think others see you, and the way they actually see\nyou all seem to be consistent in a particular situation.\n \nIn life, you seek out friendships and relationships with people who make\nyou feel comfortable with the way you see yourself and think about\nyourself. When you are with people who treat you as if you are valuable\nand important, you enjoy higher levels of self-esteem. You like and respect\nyourself more. You feel happy in their presence.\n \nFor example, in school you always did better and got better grades when\nyou felt that the teacher liked you and cared about you. At work, perhaps\nthe greatest motivator is an attitude of consideration on the part of the boss\ntoward the employee. Whenever an employee feels that the boss cares about\nhim as a person rather than just as an employee, he feels more valuable and\nperforms his job better.\n\f\nThe Law of Indirect Effort\n \nThe secret to building and maintaining wonderful friendships and\nrelationships is simple. It is for you to practice the Law of Indirect Effort in\nevery interaction with other people.\n \nYou must get out of yourself and your own preoccupations in order to get\ninto other people and how they might be thinking and feeling.\n \nTherefore, if you want to have a friend, you must first be a friend. If you\nwant people to like you, you should first like them. If you want people to\nrespect you, you should first respect them. If you want to impress others,\nyou should first be impressed by them. In this way, by approaching people\nindirectly, you appeal to their deepest subconscious needs.\n\f\nRaise Other People’s Self-Esteem\n \nThe deepest subconscious need that people have is the need to feel\nimportant. Since you have this need as well, whenever you practice the\nLaw of Indirect Effort and focus on making other people feel important,\nyou reinforce their self-image, increase their self-esteem, and make them\nfeel happy about themselves—and by extension, about yourself.\n \nWhenever you say or do anything to raise the self-esteem of another\nperson, you trigger a “boomerang” effect that causes your own self-esteem\nto go up at the same time and in the same measure. You can never do or say\nanything to make another person feel better about himself without\nsimultaneously feeling better about yourself.\n \nIt takes tremendous self-discipline and self-control for you to rise above\nyourself. Instead of trying to get other people to like you and be impressed\nby you, focus first on liking them and being impressed by them."

    "raw_text": "Seven Ways to Make People Feel Important\n \nThe key to excellent relationships with others is quite simple: Make them\nfeel important. To the degree to which you can make other people feel\nimportant—starting with the members of your family and then extending\noutward to your friends and coworkers—you will become one of the most\npopular people in your world.\n \nThere are seven ways to make other people feel important. These are\nsimple practices that you can learn through repetition.\n  \n1. Accept People the Way They Are: One of the deepest cravings of human\nnature is to be accepted by other people without judgment, evaluation, or\ncriticism. Psychologists call this behavior “unconditional positive regard.”\nThis is when you accept the other person completely, without reservation,\nfor exactly the way he or she is.\n \nBecause most people are judgmental and critical, to be unconditionally\naccepted by another person raises that person’s self-esteem, reinforces his\nor her self-image, and makes that person feel happy about him or herself.\n \nIn the movie, Bridget Jones Diary, the entire focus was on the discovery\nby Bridget that she had found a man “who likes me just the way I am.” This\nwas considered to be such an amazing thing to happen. All her friends were\nastonished that anyone could ever have a relationship based on\nunconditional acceptance by another person.\n\f\nWhen you look at other people and give them a genuine smile, they feel\nhappier about themselves. Their self-esteem goes up. They feel more\nvaluable and important.\n \nWhen you stop thinking about yourself and the impression you are\nmaking on others and instead start thinking about others and the impression\nthey are making on you, you can relax. You take a deep breath and just\nsmile at people when you meet them and greet them both at home and at\nwork. It is one of the most powerful self-esteem and relationship-building\nbehaviors you can do. Smiling at people makes them feel important and\nvaluable.\n  \n2. Show Your Appreciation for Others: Whenever you appreciate another\nperson for anything that he or she has done or said, you raise that person’s\nself-esteem and make him or her feel more important. Expressions of\nappreciation—from small nods and smiles all the way through to cards,\nletters, and gifts—raise people’s self-esteem and cause them to like\nthemselves more. As a result, by the Law of Indirect Effort, they will like\nyou more as well.\n \nThe simplest way to express appreciation is to simply say, “Thank you.”\nThe words “thank you” are deeply appreciated in any language, anywhere\nin the world. I have traveled in ninety countries, and the very first thing I do\nis learn the words for “please” and “thank you.” Each time you use those\nwords, people brighten up, smile, and feel happy to be in your presence.\n \nEvery time you say thank you, it has an almost magical effect on the\nother person. It makes him feel important and far happier about being in\nyour presence and helping you with anything you need.\n\f\n3. Be Agreeable: The most welcomed people in every situation are those\nwho are generally agreeable and positive with others. On the other hand,\nargumentative people who question, complain, and disagree are seldom\nwelcome anywhere.\n \nWhen you nod, smile, and agree with another person when he or she is\ntalking or expressing an opinion, you make that person feel intelligent,\nrespected, valuable, and important. When you are agreeable with another\nperson, even if he says something with which you may not be in complete\naccord, you make that person feel happy to be in your presence.\n \nIn my work as a professional speaker, I meet thousands of people each\nyear. They come up to me and often express opinions on subjects on which\nI am often well informed and they obviously are not. Sometimes they say\nridiculous things that are either not true or make no sense.\n \nIn every case, however, I smile and agree, nodding and asking them\nquestions and listening to them express their ideas and opinions. They go\naway feeling that they have had a good conversation with the speaker and\nthat I probably agree with them. It costs me nothing and it makes them\nhappy. It makes them feel important.\n  \n4. Show Your Admiration: People usually invest a lot of personal emotion\nin their possessions, traits, and accomplishments. When you admire\nsomething belonging to another person, it makes him feel happy about\nhimself. As Abraham Lincoln said, “Everybody likes a compliment.”\n \nExpress your admiration for people’s appearance and specific items of\ntheir clothing or dress. Men are especially complimented when you say\nsomething nice about their ties or their shoes. Women enjoy being\ncomplimented about their hair or any other item of their appearance. People\nspend a lot of time putting themselves together before they go out.\n\f\nYou can also compliment a person’s traits or characteristics, saying things\nsuch as, “You are certainly persistent.” People invest their entire lives\ndeveloping traits and qualities—especially positive qualities—and they feel\nflattered when you notice and compliment them on those qualities.\n \nCompliment a person’s accomplishments. Tell people how much you\nadmire their home or office or the business they have built or the position\nthey have achieved in that business.\n  \n5. Pay Attention to Others: Perhaps the most powerful way to raise another\nperson’s self-esteem is to listen to him attentively when he speaks. In my\nbook The Power of Charm, my coauthor Ron Arden and I explain how\nlistening to a person while he talks on any subject in a way that is focused is\nperceived as charming behavior.\n \nThe key to great listening is for you to ask questions and then hang on\nevery word of the answers. When the person slows down or comes to the\nend of a statement, ask another question. Lean forward attentively. Listen\nwithout interrupting. Listen as though what the person is saying is the\nsmartest and most interesting thing you have ever heard.\n \nWhen people are attentively listened to, their brain releases endorphins.\nAs a result, they feel happy about themselves. Their self-esteem goes up.\nWhat’s more, they associate this happy feeling with being in your presence.\nFrom this, a person will like you more and find you a more interesting and\nintelligent person.\n  \n6. Never Criticize, Condemn, or Complain about anything, whether it be\ndirectly or indirectly. Never do or say anything that lowers a person’s self-\nesteem or makes him feel less important or valuable. Refuse to gossip or"

    "raw_text": "discuss other people in a negative way. Never say anything about a person\nthat you would not say to his face.\n \nThe most harmful force in all of human relationships is destructive\ncriticism. It lowers a person’s self-esteem, makes him feel angry and\ndefensive, and causes him to dislike the source. So never complain about\npeople or situations that you don’t like.\n \nThe most common word to describe the most popular people in every\nfield is the word “nice.” When you think of a business that you like to\npatronize or a restaurant you like to visit, you always think of the people\nthere as being “nice.” Whenever you recommend or refer someone to\nsomeone else, you always mention that he or she is a “nice person.”\n \nIn sales and business, the nice people are always the most successful.\nPeople like to buy from them, buy again, and then recommend them to their\nfriends. People enjoy seeing nice people, and they look forward to seeing\nthem again.\n \nWhen asked what they mean by the word “nice,” people say that he or\nshe is “cheerful.” The more positive you are, the more cheerful you are\nlikely to be. The more cheerful you are, the nicer personality you will have.\nThe nicer personality you have, the more people will look forward to seeing\nyou and being around you.\n  \n7. Be Courteous, Concerned, and Considerate of Everyone You Meet:\nThink of these as “the three Cs” and practice them with everyone you meet.\n \nWhen you treat a person with courtesy and respect, he or she feels more\nvaluable and important. As a result of making a person feel more valuable\nand respected, that person will in turn value and respect you even more as\nwell.\n\f\nWhen you express concern about things that are happening in a person’s\nlife, he warms up to you and likes you more. When a person has a difficult\nsituation and you express your concern or compassion, you touch his heart.\nYou connect with his emotions. Through this, you make yourself a more\nlikable person.\n \nConsideration is the third of the three Cs. When you practice\nconsideration, you discipline yourself to do and say things to people that\nmakes them feel more valuable and important.\n\f\nBe Concerned About Other People\n \nWhen you meet people for the first time or again after a period of time, ask\nthem how they are, and then listen closely to the answers. People will often\nshare with you a concern or problem in their lives. When they do, practice\nconsideration and sensitivity. Treat the problem or difficulty as though it\nwere extremely important to you. Amazingly enough, when you act as if\nyou are really interested and concerned with a problem or situation in\nanother person’s life, you very soon start to feel genuinely affected\nemotionally by the other person.\n \nThe rule for building lifelong friendships and wonderful relationships is\nsimple. Resolve that from now on, when people leave your presence, they\nwill feel much better than they did when they entered your presence.\nPractice all the ideas above to make people feel important. Look for ways to\nraise people’s self-esteem and reinforce their self-image. Make them feel as\nthough they are valuable and worthwhile. Furthermore, everything that you\ndo or say to make another person feel important makes you feel important\nas well.\n\f\nAction Exercises:\n \n1. Make a list of the most important friends in your work and\npersonal life. What could you do to make them feel better about\nthemselves?\n2. Identify the first thing you could do in every meeting or\nencounter to make the other person feel important.\n3. Resolve to make each person feel more valuable and\nworthwhile because he or she spoke to you.\n4. Practice nonjudgmentalism in all your relationships. Always\nassume the best of intentions on the part of others.\n5. Imagine that each person you meet has only a short time to live\nand you are the only person who knows.\n6. Find something about each person that is impressive to you,\nand then tell the other person how impressed you are.\n7. Imagine that there is a hidden camera and microphone\nrecording every interaction you have with other people. How would\nyou behave differently?\n\f\nChapter 21\n \nSelf-Discipline and Peace of Mind\n \n“Men are anxious to improve their circumstances, but are unwilling to\nimprove themselves; they therefore remain bound. The man who does\nnot shrink from self-crucifixion can never fail to accomplish the object\nupon which his heart is set. This is true of earthly as of heavenly\nthings. Even the man whose object is to acquire wealth must be\nprepared to make great personal sacrifices before he can accomplish\nhis object; and how much more so he who would realize a strong and\nwell-poised life.”\n—JAMES ALLEN\n \nYou require high levels of self-discipline if you truly desire to develop all\nyour inner resources and fulfill your true potential. Throughout the ages, in\nall religions and philosophies the highest human good or idea has been\npeace of mind. Your ability to achieve your own peace of mind is the true\nmeasure of your success and the key determinant of your happiness.\n \nTo develop spiritually, and to become a fully functioning person, you\nmust regularly apply self-discipline and self-control to your thoughts,\nfeelings, and actions. Spiritual development, inner peace, and the\nexperience of joy all require self-mastery and self-control."

    "raw_text": "Outer Versus Inner Success\n \nTo succeed in the “outer world,” you must discipline yourself to focus and\nconcentrate, work hard at your job, take continuous action toward your\ngoals, and become better and more capable as you move onward and\nupward in life.\n \nTo succeed in the “inner world,” however, requires almost the opposite\nabilities. To achieve inner peace, you must discipline yourself to let go of\neverything that can disrupt your sense of inner peace and contentment.\n \nZen Buddhism teaches that the main cause of human suffering and\nunhappiness is “attachment.” People become attached to ideas, opinions,\nand material things, and then they are reluctant to let go of them.\nSometimes people become so preoccupied with these external factors that it\naffects their mental and physical health—even keeping them awake at\nnight.\n \nWhen you practice detachment, separating yourself emotionally from\nthings or outcomes, the negative emotions involved stop as well, like\nunplugging a light from the socket.\n\f\nThe Need to Be Right\n \nMost people have a deep down need to be right. However, when you stop\ncaring if you are right or wrong, all the emotions surrounding this need for\nrightness disappear. Dr. Gerald Jampolsky asked the great question: “Do\nyou want to be right, or do you want to be happy?”\n \nSome people become passionate about their political or religious beliefs,\nall of which have been learned from someone else in some way. But when\nyou put those beliefs aside for a while, they lose their ability to stir your\nemotions or to inflame your anger.\n \nI have friends and meet people with ideas and opinions that range all over\nthe political and religious spectrums. In most cases, we get along well\ntogether because we simply put aside the discussion of opinions on which\nwe differ. We consciously and deliberately discipline ourselves to detach\nfrom these ideas, and we focus instead on subjects that we agree on and in\nwhich we share common interests."

    "raw_text": "Refuse to Blame Anyone for Anything\n \nThe chief cause of negative emotions and the primary destroyer of inner\npeace is blame. As I mentioned earlier in the book, it is not possible to have\na negative emotion without having someone or something to blame in some\nway or for something.\n \nBlame requires one or both of two factors to exist. The first is\nidentification. This occurs when you take something personally: You\nidentify with it. As soon as you decide to feel that someone has done or said\nsomething negative that affects your personal interests in some way, you\nimmediately become angry and blame that person.\n \nEven if someone who is hurrying to work, completely preoccupied, and\nwho may have just had a fight with his or her spouse accidentally cuts you\noff in traffic, you can immediately become angry at that person, a complete\nstranger, because you took his driving behavior personally.\n \nBut when you discipline yourself to detach and stop taking things\npersonally, the negative emotional charge connected with the person or\nincident stops almost immediately. For example, when someone cuts you\noff in traffic, you can detach from the situation emotionally by saying to\nyourself, “Oh well, he’s probably in a hurry to get to work. Maybe he’s\nlate.”\n \nThe minute you say that to yourself, all negativity associated with the\nevent vanishes and you become calm, relaxed, and positive once more.\n\f\nGive Up Your Suffering\n \nThe second root cause of blaming is justification. This occurs when you tell\nyourself (and others) why it is that you are entitled to be angry or upset in\nthis situation.\n \nMany people fall in love with their suffering. Their past problems\nbecome a primary focus of their lives. They think about what happened all\nthe time. They go through the day and even the night carrying on angry\nconversations with people who are not present, people who they feel have\nhurt them in the past.\n \nWhenever they get into a conversation for any period of time, they bring\nout their suffering, like a trader in a bazaar, and display it to the other\nperson. They then recycle through the unhappy events of their lives, telling\nwhat happened, how they were badly treated, and how awful the other\nperson was to have behaved in this way.\n \nHowever, when you discipline yourself to stop justifying your negative\nemotions by continually rehashing what happened and what the other\nperson did or didn’t do, and when you instead calmly accept that “stuff\nhappens” in life, your negativity accompanying the other person or situation\ndies away."

    "raw_text": "Practice Forgiveness\n \nThe height of self-discipline in spiritual development is the practice of\nforgiveness. The Law of Forgiveness says that “you are mentally and\nemotionally healthy to the degree that you can freely forgive anyone who\nhas hurt you in any way.”\n \nEvery person—including you—has experienced destructive criticism,\nnegative treatment, unkindness, rudeness, unfairness, betrayal, and\ndishonesty from others over the years. These events are unfortunate, but\nthey are an inevitable and unavoidable part of being a member of the human\nrace. The only way you can avoid the problems and difficulties of living in\na busy society with many different kinds of people is to live in a cave.\n \nThe only question you need to ask and answer after you have had a\nnegative experience is “How long will it take me to get over this event and\nget on with my life?” This is a decision only you can make. It is one of the\nmost important types of decisions that you make in your own life if you\ntruly want to be happy. What’s more, it is a true test of your mental and\nspiritual discipline.\n\f\nThe Forgetting Curve\n \nEach person has a “Forgetting Curve,” or what is often called a\n“Forgiveness Curve.” This curve measures how quickly you forgive and\nforget a negative experience, and it determines how mentally and\nemotionally healthy you really are.\n \nImagine a rectangle with a scale from zero to one hundred ascending the\nleft side of the rectangle. This is the scale of the intensity of the negative\nemotion you experience when you are hurt or offended in some way. Across\nthe bottom of this graph are the months and years of your life.\n \nYou can have either a flat forgiveness curve or a steep, downward sloping\nforgiveness curve. If your forgiveness curve is flat, this means that you\ncontinue to be angry for a long time, sometimes for years or even decades at\nthe same level as when the event occurred.\n \nThere are countless people who are still angry about something one of\ntheir parents did or said to them decades ago. Furthermore, they will tell\nyou about it at the drop of a hat. They will reach into their gunnysack of\nunforgiven events and pull out their childhood experiences and share them\nwith you.\n \nEvery psychologist and psychiatrist who deal with unhappy people are\nemployed because their patients have flat forgiveness curves. Their primary\nconversation in therapy is talking about what someone did or didn’t do to\nthem or for them at some point in the past—and how unhappy that person\nstill feels about it today.\n\f\n\n\f\nGet Over It and Get On with It\n \nTruly healthy people, on the other hand, have downward sloping\nforgiveness curves. They have had just as many difficulties and problems in\nlife as anyone else, but they have disciplined themselves by resolving to\nforgive and forget quickly so they can get on with their lives. They refuse to\ngunnysack their problems and carry them forward. They simply let them go\nand turn their attention to the things that make them happy.\n \nThe discipline of forgiveness is the key to the spiritual kingdom. It is\nonly possible for you to enjoy high levels of peace of mind when you\ndevelop the habit and discipline of freely forgiving other people for\neverything and anything that they have done to hurt you.\n\f\nForgiveness Is Selfish\n \nSome people are confused about the concept of forgiveness. They think that\nforgiving someone else for having hurt them is the same as condoning that\nbehavior, or even approving of it. Quite the contrary. Forgiveness is a\npurely selfish act. Forgiveness has nothing whatever to do with the other\nperson. You forgive others so that you yourself can be emotionally free, so\nthat you no longer carry that baggage around with you.\n \nYou have a wonderful mind. You are incredibly intelligent and insightful.\nYou can use your mind on your behalf in order to help you to be joyous and\nhappy or you can use it against yourself. The way you use your mind at the\nhighest level is to find reasons to forgive others. Instead of rehashing and\ndissecting a past event, looking for rationalizations, justifications, and\nreasons to take something personally, use your intelligence to find reasons\nto accept responsibility and let go of the negative situation."

    "raw_text": "Accept Responsibility and Forgive\n \nThe instant you accept responsibility and forgive everyone for anything that\nthey ever did to hurt you in any way, you liberate yourself completely. All\nyour negative emotions disappear. In place of your negative emotions, you\nexperience a sense of inner peace, love, happiness, and joy.\n \nThe payoff for using your self-discipline to practice forgiveness on an\nongoing basis is extraordinary. When you use your incredible abilities of\nself-control, self-mastery, and detachment to separate yourself emotionally\nfrom situations that would otherwise make you unhappy, the entire quality\nof your life improves in a wonderful way.\n  \nAction Exercises:\n 1. Take the forgiveness test: Do you want to be right or do\nyou want to be happy?\n2. Identify the people from your past who you feel have hurt\nyou in any way, and then make a decision today to forgive them\nand let go of those negative feelings.\n3. Find reasons not to justify your negative emotions of\nblame or anger, and instead, use your intelligence to accept\nresponsibility.\n4. Set peace of mind as your highest goal, and then resolve\nto let go of any thoughts or emotions that disturb you in any way.\n5. Begin today to read something spiritual and uplifting each\nmorning before you begin your day. This habit will change your\nlife.\n\f\n6. From now on, refuse to take things personally.
