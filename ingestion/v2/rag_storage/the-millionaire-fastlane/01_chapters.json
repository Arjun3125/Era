    "raw_text": "“The Fastlane mentality is a refreshing perspective on growing wealth in time to \nenjoy it. I am so tired of the traditional advice of working hard and saving gradu -\nally. This Slowlane approach was not working for me. MJ helped me realize what \nwas possible, and I am ‘accelerating’ faster than I could have imagined. My business \nand my net worth is growing every day. I hate to imagine where I would be today \nwithout The Fastlane.”\n— Skyler R., Idaho Falls, Idaho\n“Before I discovered The Fastlane, I had the opinion that money had to be earned by \nworking for someone else 10 hours a day for at least 50 years. I thought that making \nmillions was only for those who had either rich parents or luck. Now I know better—\nmaking millions neither requires rich parents nor luck. It requires the knowledge \nof how to make those millions. And through the Fastlane, I was able to acquire this \nknowledge.” \n— Florian F., Augsburg, Germany\n“To say that your advice and the ‘Fastlane principles’ you teach have changed my life \nis an understatement. I KNEW there was a better life out there, but I had become \nfrustrated about how to reach it. After reading months of your free advice in the \nfree Fastlane Forum, it all started coming together for me. I began to see WHY I was \nliving paycheck to paycheck, and I decided then that I was going to escape it. Four \nyears later, I have almost quadrupled my net worth. I have saved and invested more \nin the past few years then many of my friends in their 30s. Furthermore, at 26 years \nold now, the education I have received in the past four years far exceeds anything \nI could have learned in college.”\n— Mike G., Washington, New Jersey\n“The Fastlane has taught me how to think BIG and realize that a 9–5 job is not the \nanswer. I will soon graduate college and not be worried with interviews. Thanks!”\n— Luke M., Durham, North Carolina\n“If it weren’t for the Fastlane, I’d still be looking at a pencil-pushing future, living a life \nof frugality with suppressed dreams, and dreading rolling out of bed every single day. \nThanks to MJ and the Fastlane community, my mind, life, and doors have opened \nup like I never could have imagined! I’m on track to leave my J-O-B lifestyle in the \ndust, speeding off into the sunset with exuberance and abundance!”\n— Matt J., Orlando, Florida\n\f\n\n\f\nthe Millionaire\nFASTLANE\nMJ D E MARCO\nCraCk the Code to Wealth\nand live riCh for a lifetime\n\f\nCopyright © 2011 MJ DeMarco \nAll rights reserved.\nNo part of this book may be reproduced in any form or by any electronic or \nmechanical means, including information storage and retrieval systems, without \npermission in writing from the publisher.

    "raw_text": "vi\nPreface\nThe “Lamborghini Pro Phecy” c om PLeTes\nThe Millionaire Fastlane is the echo of a chance encounter I had long ago when I was \na pudgy teenager. It was a Fastlane ignition of consciousness, a resurrection trig -\ngered by a stranger driving a mythic car—a Lamborghini Countach. The Fastlane \nwas born, and with it the resolution and belief that creating wealth need not take \n50 years of financial mediocrity devoured by decades of work, decades of saving, \ndecades of mindless frugality, and decades of 8% stock market returns.\nOften, this book references the Lamborghini brand, and it isn’t to brag when \nI say I’ve owned a few. The Lamborghini icon represents the fulfillment of a proph-\necy in my life. It innocently started when I saw my first Lamborghini and it kicked \nmy ass out of my comfort zone. I confronted its young owner and asked a simple \nquestion: “How can you afford such an awesome car?”\nThe answer I received, unveiled in chapter 2, was short and powerful, but I wish \nI had more. I wish that man had taken a minute, an hour, a day, or a week to talk \nto me. I wish that young stranger would have mentored me on how to get what \nI thought the Lamborghini represented: wealth. I wish that man had reached into \nhis car and given me a book. \nFast-forward to today. As I endanger the streets in my Lamborghini, I relive \nthat same moment except in role reversal. To celebrate my Fastlane success, \nI bought one of these legendary beasts, a Lamborghini Diablo. If you’ve never had \nthe opportunity to drive a car that costs more than most people’s homes, let me \ntell you how it works: You can’t be shy. People chase you in traffic. They tailgate \nyou, rubberneck, and cause accidents. Getting gas is an event: people snap photos, \nenraged environmentalists give you the evil eye, and haters insinuate about the \nlength of your penis—as if owning a Hyundai implies being well endowed. Mostly, \npeople ask questions. \nThe most frequent questions come from leering and inquisitive teenagers, as \nI was many years ago: “Wow, how can you afford one of these?” or “What do you \ndo?” People associate a Lamborghini with wealth, and while that’s more an illu -\nsion than anything (any dimwit can finance a Lamborghini), it’s indicative of a \ndream lifestyle that most people conceive as incomprehensible. \nNow when I hear the same question I asked decades ago, I have the power to \ngift a book and perhaps, to gift a dream. This book is my official answer.\n\f\nvii\nContents\nin Troduc Tion  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ix\nPar T 1 — wea LTh in a whee Lchair: \n              “g eT r ich sL ow” i s g eT r ich oL d . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1\nChapter 1: The Great Deception 3\nChapter 2: How I Screwed “Get Rich Slow”  7\nPar T 2 — wea LTh is no T a road, bu T a road T ri P!  . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nChapter 3: The Road Trip to Wealth 21\nChapter 4: The Roadmaps to Wealth 26\nPar T 3 — P oorness: The s idewa Lk r oadma P  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 31\nChapter 5: The Road Most Traveled: The Sidewalk 33\nChapter 6: Has Your Wealth Been Toxified? 41\nChapter 7: Misuse Money and Money Will Misuse You 45\nChapter 8: Lucky Bastards Play the Game 51\nChapter 9: Wealth Demands Accountability 55\nPar T 4 — mediocri Ty: The sL ow Lane r oadma P  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 61\nChapter 10: The Lie You’ve Been Sold: The Slowlane 63\nChapter 11: The Criminal Trade: Your Job 73\nChapter 12: The Slowlane: Why You Aren’t Rich 78\nChapter 13: The Futile Fight: Education 87\nChapter 14: The Hypocrisy of the Gurus 90\nChapter 15: Slowlane Victory . . .

You can live rich, retire four decades \nearly, and live a life that most can’t. Sadly, the shortcut is cleverly camouflaged \nfrom your view. Instead of the shortcut, you’re led down a paralyzing road to \nmediocrity—a dulled cornucopia of financial stratagem tailored to the slumber -\ning masses, a legion of mandates that sacrifices your wildest dreams in favor of \nnumbed expectations. \nThat road? It’s financial mediocrity, known as “Get Rich Slow,” “The Slowlane,” \nor “Wealth in a Wheelchair.” That tedium sounds like this:\nGo to school, get good grades, graduate, get a good job, save 10%, invest in \nthe stock market, max your 401 K, slash your credit cards, and clip coupons . . . \nthen, someday, when you are, oh, 65 years old, you will be rich.\nThis dictation is a decree to trade life, for life. It’s the long way, and no, it isn’t \nscenic. If wealth were an ocean voyage, “Get Rich Slow” would be sailing around \nthe horn of South America, while the Fastlaner uses the shortcut—the Panama \nCanal.\nThe Millionaire Fastlane isn’t a static strategy that preaches “go buy real estate,” \n“think positively,” or “start a business,” but a complete psychological and math -\nematical formula that cracks the code to wealth and unlocks the gateway to the \nshortcut. The Fastlane is a progression of distinctions that gives probability to the \nunspeakable: Live richly today while young, and decades before standard norms \nof retirement. Yes, you can win a lifetime of freedom and prosperity, and it doesn’t \nmatter if you’re 18 or 40. What “Get Rich Slow” does in 50 years, the Fastlane \nshortcut does in five. \nw hy c an’ T you d ri Ve The s hor Tcu T?\nIf you’re a typical wealth seeker, your approach to wealth can be predictably fore-\ntold by a timeless question: What do I have to do to get rich? The quest for the \nanswer—wealth’s Holy Grail—throws you into a mode of pursuit where you chase\n\f\nx\nthe millionaire fastlane a variety of strategies, theories, careers, and schemes that supposedly will bring \ngreat wealth into your lap. Invest in real estate! Trade currencies! Play pro ball! \n“What do I have to do?” screams the wealth seeker! \nNo, please stop. The answer is more about what you’ve been doing than what you \nhaven’t. There’s an old proverb that has mutated a few times but the gist is this: If \nyou want to keep getting what you’re getting, keep doing what you’re doing.\nThe translation? STOP! If you aren’t wealthy, STOP doing what you’re doing. \nSTOP following the conventional wisdom. STOP following the crowd and using the \nwrong formula. STOP following the roadmap that forsakes dreams and leads to \nmediocrity. STOP traveling roads with punitive speed limits and endless detours. \nI call it “anti-advice,” and much of this book follows this prescription.\nThis book lists nearly 300 wealth distinctions designed to crack the code to \nwealth and get you off your current road and onto a new road where you can \nexpose wealth’s shortcut. The distinctions are directional markers to “STOP” your \nold ways of action, thinking, and believing, and reorient you into a new direction. \nIn essence, you have to unlearn what you have learned .\nyour r eaLiTy d oesn’ T c hange m ine\nThis section is for the haters. I present the Fastlane with brash cynicism. This book \ncontains a lot of “tough love,” and while it is opinionated, you ultimately have to \nseek your own truth. The Fastlane might insult, offend, or challenge you because it \nwill violate everything you’ve been taught. It will contradict the teachings of your \nparents, your teachers, and financial planners. And since I violate all that society \nrepresents, you can bet mediocre minds will take issue. \nThankfully, your belief (or disbelief) of Fastlane strategy doesn’t change my \nreality; it only changes yours. Let me repeat: What you think of the Fastlane doesn’t \nchange my reality; its purpose is to change yours. \nSo let me tell you about my reality.  I live happily in a big house overlooking \nthe mountains in beautiful Phoenix, Arizona. There are rooms in my house that \nI don’t visit for weeks. Yes, the home is too large, and that story is a horrifying \nepic best forgotten. \nI can’t remember the last time I awakened to an alarm clock—everyday is a \nSaturday. I have no job and no boss. I don’t own a suit or a tie. My cholesterol level \nconfirms that I dine at Italian restaurants far too often. I smoke cheap cigars. As \nof this edition, I drive a Toyota Tacoma for work (“work” means going to the gym \nand grocery shopping) and a Lamborghini Murcielago Roadster for play. I almost \nlost my life street racing a 750-horsepower Viper laced with nitrous oxide. I shop \nat Costco, Kohl’s, and Wal-Mart if I’m in the neighborhood and it’s past 12 a.m. \nNo, I don’t drive the Lamborghini to Wal-Mart; that might cause a disruption in \nthe space-time-continuum. Trekkies know better.\nI don’t own a watch more expensive than $149. I enjoy tennis, golf, biking,\n\f\nxi\nintroductionswimming, hiking, softball, poker, pool, art, travel, and writing. I travel whenever \nand wherever I want. Other than my mortgage, I have no debt. You can’t buy me \ngifts because I have everything I want. Prices for most things are inconsequential \nbecause if I want it, I buy it.\nI made my first million when I was 31. Five years earlier, I was living with my \nmother. I retired when I was 37. Every month I earn thousands of dollars in interest \nand appreciation on investments working around the globe. No matter what I do \non any day, one thing is sure: I get paid and I do not have to work. I have financial \nfreedom because I cracked wealth’s code and escaped financial mediocrity. I’m a \nnormal guy living an abnormal life. It’s a fantasyland but my reality, my normal, \nmy deviation from ordinary where I can pursue my most implausible dreams in \na life free of financial encumbrances. Had I chosen the preordained road, “Get \nRich Slow,” my dreams would be on life-support, likely replaced with an alarm \nclock and a heavy morning commute. \nHow about your dreams? Do they need resuscitation? Is your life on a road \nthat converges with a dream, or is one? If your dreams have lost probability it’s \npossible “Get Rich Slow” has killed them. “Get Rich Slow” criminally asks you to \nbarter your freedom for freedom. It’s an insane trade and a dream destroyer. \nAlternatively, if you travel the right roads and leverage the right roadmap, you \ncan resurrect your dreams to possibility. Yes, as a Fastlane traveler you can create \nwealth fast, screw “Get Rich Slow,” and win a lifetime of prosperity, freedom, and \ndream fulfillment . . . just as I did. \nIf this book hasn’t found you early in life, don’t worry. The Fastlane doesn’t care \nabout your age, your job experience, your race, or your gender. It doesn’t care about \nyour “F” in eighth grade gym class or your beer-drinking reputation in college. The \nFastlane doesn’t care about your Ivy League college degree or your Harvard MBA. \nIt doesn’t ask you to be a famous athlete, actor, or a finalist on American Idol. The \nFastlane is merciful on your past if you just unlock the gateway into its universe.\nFinally, at the risk of sounding like a late-night infomercial, let me clarify: I’m \nnot a self-proclaimed guru nor do I want to be. I dislike gurus because “guruness” \nimplies know-it-all status. Call me the “anti-guru” of “Get Rich Slow.” The Fastlane \nis a lifetime school with no graduates; 20-plus years into this and I humbly admit, \nI have more to learn.\nsorry, no Four- hour w ork w eek h ere\nFirst, let’s get something clear: This isn’t a “how-to” book. I’m not going to tell \nyou every nuance about “how I did it” because how I did it isn’t relevant. This \nbook doesn’t contain a list of Web sites that outline ways to “outsource” your \nlife. Success is a journey, and it can’t be outsourced to India in a four-hour work-\nweek. The Millionaire Fastlane is like a yellow brick road paved in psychology and \nmathematics that put the odds of massive wealth in your favor."

    "raw_text": "xii\nthe millionaire fastlane During my Fastlane journey of discovery, I always sought the absolute, infallible \nformula that would lead to wealth. What I found was ambiguity and subjective \nimperatives like “be determined” or “persistence pays” or “it’s not what you know, \nbut who.” While these tidbits compiled part of the formula, they didn’t guarantee \nwealth. A workable formula uses mathematical constructs and not ambiguous state-\nments. Does wealth have a mathematical formula, a code that you could exploit \nto tilt the odds in your favor? Yes, the Fastlane quantifies it.\nNow for the bad news. Many wealth seekers have false expectations about \n“money” books and think that some fairy-guru will do the work. The road to \nwealth has no escort and is always under construction. No one drops millions on \nyour lap; the road is yours to travel and yours alone. I can open the door but I can’t \nmake you walk through it. I don’t claim the Fastlane is easy; it’s hard work. If you \nexpect a four-hour workweek here, you will be disappointed. All I can be is that \ncreepy munchkin pointing off in the distance with a stern directive, “Follow the \nyellow brick road.” \nThe Fastlane is that road.\nc oFF ee wi Th a m u LTimi LLionaire\nI’ve approached this book conversationally, as if you’re my new friend and we’re \nhaving coffee in a quaint neighborhood café. That means my intent is to educate \nyou—not to upsell you into some expensive seminar, membership website, or some \nbackend marketing funnel. While I will interact with you as if you’re my friend, \nlet’s face it: I don’t have a clue who you are. I don’t have intimate details about your \npast, your age, your biases, your spouse, or your education. Therefore, I need to \nmake some general assumptions to ensure that our conversation seems personal \nto you. My assumptions:\n • You look around your life and think, “there’s got to be more.” \n • You have big dreams, yet you’re concerned that the road you’re traveling will \nnever converge with those dreams. \n • You’re college-bound, college-enrolled, or college-educated. \n • You have a job you don’t enjoy or isn’t going to make you rich. \n • You have little savings and carry a load of debt.\n • You contribute regularly to a 401 K. \n • You see rich people and wonder, “how did they do it?”\n • You have bought a few “get rich quick” books and/or programs. \n • You live in a free, democratic society where education and free choice are \nstandards.\n • Your parents subscribe to the old school: “Go to college and get a good job.” \n • You don’t have any physical talent; your chances of becoming a professional \nathlete, singer, entertainer, or actor are zero.\n\f\nxiii\nintroduction • You are young and full of enthusiasm about the future, but unsure where to \ndirect it.\n • You are older and have been in the workforce for some time. After all these \nyears, you don’t have a lot to show for it and are tired of “starting over.” \n • You’ve put your heart and soul into a job only to be laid off due to a bad econ-\nomy or cutbacks.\n • You’ve lost money in the stock market or traditional investments championed \nby mainstream financial gurus.\nIf some of these assumptions reflect your situation, this book will have an \nimpact.\nhow This b ook i s organized\nAt the conclusion of each chapter, there is a subsection titled “Chapter Summary: \nFastlane Distinctions” which chronicles the critical distinctions to Fastlane strat -\negy. Don’t ignore these! They’re the building blocks to engineering your Fastlane. \nAdditionally, the stories and examples in this book come from the Fastlane Forum \nand other personal finance forums. While the stories are real and come from real \npeople with real problems, I’ve changed the names and edited the dialogue for \nclarity. And finally, feel free to discuss Fastlane strategy with thousands of others \nat the Fastlane Forum (TheFastlaneForum.com). When the Fastlane changes your \nlife, stop by and tell us how or email me at mj.demarco@yahoo.com! \nIt took me years to uncover and assemble the Fastlane strategies, learn them, use \nthem, and ultimately make millions. Bored, retired, and yes, still young with hair, \nI give you The Millionaire Fastlane: Crack the Code to Wealth and Live Rich for A \nLifetime! Fasten your seat belts, grab a ten-buck latte, and let’s go on a road trip!"

Show me the \nman who earned millions in three years by maximizing his 401 K. Show me the \nyoung twenty-something who got rich clipping coupons. Where are these people?  \nThey don’t exist. They’re fairy tales of impossibility.\nYet, we continue to trust the same old tired gang of financial media darlings \nwho espouse these doctrines of wealth.

Wasn’t it the recession that exposed “Get Rich Slow” \nfor the fraud it is? Oh I get it, if you’re employed for 40 years and avoid 40% mar -\nket downturns, “Get Rich Slow” works; just sit back, work, and hope death don’t \nmeet you first because, golly-gee, you’re going to be the richest guy in the retire -\nment home! \nThe message of “Get Rich Slow” is clear: Sacrifice your today, your dreams, \nand your life for a plan that pays dividends after most of your life has evaporated. \nLet me be blunt: If your road to wealth devours your active adult life and it’s not \nguaranteed, that road sucks. A “road to wealth” codependent on Wall Street and \nanchored by time with your life wagered as the gamble is a dirty, rotten alley. \nNonetheless, the preordained plan continues to wield power, recommended \nand enforced by a legion of hypocritical “financial experts” who aren’t rich by their \nown advice, but by their own Millionaire Fastlane. The Slowlane prognosticators \nknow something that they aren’t telling you: What they teach doesn’t work, but \nselling it does.\n\f\n5\npART 1 — weAlTh in A wheelchAiR: “geT Rich slow” is geT Rich oldw eaLTh y oung: i s iT b u LLshi T?\nThe Millionaire Fastlane isn’t about being retired old with millions, but about rede-\nfining wealth to include youth, fun, freedom, and prosperity. Take this comment \nposted on the Fastlane Forum:\n“Is it bullshit?

Can you really get free of the rat race young? I’m a 23-year-old \ninvestment banker in Chicago, Illinois. I make a modest salary and modest \ncommissions.

I remember looking at him and thinking ‘God . . . that \ncan’t be true! It’s gotta be bullshit! It’s gotta be!’”\nI can verify—it isn’t bullshit. You can live “the life” and still be young. Old \nage is not a prerequisite to wealth or retirement. However, the real BS is thinking \nyou can do it by the default “Get Rich Slow” construct, at least by the time you hit \nyour 30th birthday.

I see \nold and immobile. Heck, I even smell something musty circa 1971. People retire \nin their 60s or 70s. Even at that age, they struggle to make ends meet and have \nto rely on bankrupted government programs just to survive. Others work well \ninto their “golden years” just to maintain their lifestyle. Some never make it and \nwork until death. \nHow does this happen? Simple. “Get Rich Slow” takes a lifetime to travel and \nits success is nefariously dependent on too many factors you cannot control. Invest \n50 years into a job and miserly living, then, one day, you can retire rich alongside \nyour wheelchair and prescription pillbox. How uninspiring. \nYet, millions undertake the 50-year gamble. Those who succeed receive their \nreward of financial freedom with a stinking lump of turd: old age. Gee thanks.

A 50-year road to \nwealth isn’t compelling, and because of it, few succeed and those who do settle for \nfinancial freedom in life’s twilight. \nThe problem with accepted norms of retirement is what you do not see . You \ndon’t see youth, you don’t see fun, and you don’t see the realization of dreams. \nThe golden years aren’t golden at all but a waiting room for death. If you want \nfinancial freedom before the Grim Reaper hits the on-deck circle, “Get Rich Slow” \nisn’t the answer.\nIf you want to retire young with health, vibrancy, and hair, you’re going to need \nto ignore society’s default “Get Rich Slow” roadmap and the gurus spoon-feeding \nyou the slop in the trough.

Common roads to wealth for the young are competitive and \nrequire talent; become an actor, a musician, an entertainer or a pro athlete—all \nroads that had a big “ROAD CLOSED” sign that laughed, “Not a chance, MJ!” \nSo, early in life, I conceded. I gave up on my dreams. “Get Rich Slow” made it \nabundantly clear: Go to school, get a job, settle for less, sacrifice, be miserly and \nquit dreaming about financial freedom, mountainside homes, and exotic cars. \nBut I still dreamed. It’s what teenage boys do. For me, it was all about the cars—\nspecifically, the Lamborghini Countach. \nThe 90 s econds T ha T c hanged m y Li Fe\nI grew up in Chicago and was a porky kid with few friends. I wasn’t interested \nin teenage girls or sports, but lying around in a beanbag stuffing my face with \ndoughnuts while watching Tom-n-Jerry reruns. Parental supervision was absent; \nMom divorced Dad years earlier, which left my older siblings and me to be raised \nby a single mother. Mom didn’t have a college education or a career, unless a deep-\nfrying job at Kentucky Fried Chicken qualified. That left me to my own indulgences, \nusually consumption of sweets and the latest episode of the A-Team. My exertions \nwere epitomized by a long broken broomstick: I used it as the TV’s remote control \nsince the real one was broken and I was too lazy to move. When I did move, the\n\f\n8\nthe millionaire fastlane local ice cream shop was often my target; a sugary delight was a motive I could \ncount on.\nThat day was like any other day: I sought ice cream. I plotted the flavor of my \nnext indulgence and headed toward the ice cream parlor. When I arrived, there \nit was. I was face to face with my dream car; a Lamborghini Countach famous \nfrom the 80s hit movie Cannonball Run . Parked stoically like an omnipotent king, \nI gazed upon it like a worshiper beholden to its God. Awestruck, any thoughts of \nice cream were banished from my brain. \nPosterized on my bedroom walls and drooled upon in my favorite car magazines, \nI was acutely familiar with the Lamborghini Countach: cunning, evil, obscenely \nfast, spaceship doors, and ungodly expensive. Yet, here it was just a few feet away, \nlike Elvis resurrected. Its raw tangible grandeur was like an artisan coming face \nto face with an authentic Monet. The lines, the curves, the smell . . .\nI gawked for a few minutes, until a young man left the ice cream parlor and \nheaded toward the car. Could this be the owner? No way. He couldn’t have been \nmore than 25 years old. Dressed in blue jeans and an oversized flannel shirt with \nwhat I spied to be an Iron Maiden concert shirt underneath, I reasoned this couldn’t \nbe the owner. I expected an old guy: wrinkled, receding gray hairline, and dressed \ntwo seasons late. Not so.\n“What the heck?” I thought. How could a young guy afford such a kick-ass auto-\nmobile? For God’s sake, that car costs more than the house I live in! It’s got to be \na lottery winner, I speculated. Hmmm . . . or maybe some rich kid who inherited \nthe family fortune. No, it’s a pro athlete. Yes, that’s it, I concluded.\nSuddenly, a daring thought invaded my head: “Hey, MJ, why don’t you ask the \nguy what he does for a living?” Could I? I stood on the sidewalk, dumbfounded \nwhile I negotiated with myself. Emboldened and overcome with adrenaline, I found \nmy legs moving toward the car as if my brain weren’t agreeable. In the back of my \nmind, my brother taunted, “Danger, Will Robinson, danger!”\nSensing my approach, the owner hid his trepidation with a forced smile and \nopened his door. Whoa. The car’s door flung up into the sky, vertically, as opposed \nto swinging out sideways like a normal car. It threw me off what little game I had \nand I tried to maintain my composure, as if cars with futuristic doors were stan -\ndard fare. What couldn’t have been more than 20 words seemed like a novel. My \nopportunity was here and I snatched it. “Excuse me, sir?” I nervously muttered, \nhoping he wouldn’t ignore me. “May I ask what you do for a living?”\nRelieved that I wasn’t a teenage derelict, the owner kindly responded: “I’m an \ninventor.” Perplexed that his answer didn’t match my preconception; my prepared \nfollow-up questions were nullified, paralyzing my next move. I stood there frozen \nlike the ice cream I had sought minutes earlier. Sensing the opportunity for escape, \nthe young Lamborghini owner took the driver’s seat, closed his door, and started \nthe engine. The loud roar of the exhaust swept through the parking lot, alerting\n\f\n9\npART 1 — weAlTh in A wheelchAiR: “geT Rich slow” is geT Rich oldall life forms to the Lamborghini’s formidable presence. Whether I liked it or not, \nthe conversation was over.\nKnowing it might be years before such a sight would happen again, I took \nmental inventory of the automotive unicorn before me. I left awakened as a neural \npathway suddenly smacked open in my brain.  \nThe Libera Tion F rom Fame and Ta Len T\nWhat changed that day?  I was exposed to the Fastlane and a new truth. As for \nthe sweets I pursued that day, I never made it into the store. I turned around and \nwent home with a new reality.  I wasn’t athletic, I couldn’t sing, and I couldn’t act, \nbut I could get rich without fame or without physical talent.\nFrom that point forward, things changed. The Lamborghini encounter lasted \n90 seconds, but transcended a lifetime of new beliefs, directions, and choices. \nI decided that I would someday own a Lamborghini and I would do it while I was \nyoung.  I was unwilling to wait until my next encounter, my next chance experi -\nence, and my next poster: I wanted it for myself. Yes, I retired the broomstick and \ngot off my fat ass.\nThe s earch F or T he m iLLionaire Fas TLane\nAfter the Lamborghini encounter, I made a conscious effort to study young mil -\nlionaires who weren’t famous or physically talented. But I wasn’t interested in all \nmillionaires, just those who lived a rich, extravagant lifestyle. This examination \nled me to study a limited, obscure group of people: a small subset of fameless mil-\nlionaires who met these criteria:\n1) They were living a rich lifestyle or were capable of such. I wasn’t interested in \nhearing from frugal millionaires who lived “next door” in the middle class.\n2)  They had to be relatively young (under 35) or they had to have acquired wealth \nfast. I wasn’t interested in people who spent 40 years of their life jobbing and \npenny-pinching their way to millions. I wanted to be rich young, not old.\n3)  They had to be self-made. I was broke. Silver-spoon winners of the lucky sperm \nlottery weren’t invited to my lab. \n4)  Their riches couldn’t be from fame, physical talent, playing pro ball, acting, \nsinging, or entertaining. \nI sought millionaires who would have started like me, an average guy without \nany special skill or talent, who, somehow, made it big. Through high school and \ncollege, I religiously studied this millionaire divergence. I read magazines, books, \nand newspapers and watched documentaries of successful businessmen; anything \nthat provided insight into this small subset of millionaires, I absorbed it. \nUnfortunately, this zest to uncover the secret to fast wealth led me to disap -\n\f\n10\nthe millionaire fastlane pointments. I was a late-night infomercial marketer’s dream come true—gullible, \nwilling, and armed with a credit card. I bought into countless opportunities, from \n“one tiny classified ad” to the Asian real estate mogul and his sexy bikini-clad yacht \nvixens. None of them delivered wealth, and despite the slick commercials and their \nclaims, the large-breasted models never materialized.\nAs I fed my appetite for knowledge and endured one odd job after another, my \nresearch uncovered some remarkable common denominators. I was confident \nI had uncovered all the components to the Millionaire Fastlane and fameless \nwealth. I was determined to become rich young, and the journey would begin \nafter college graduation. Little did I know what lay ahead—the roadblocks, the \ndetours, and the mistakes.\nresis Tance in To m ediocri Ty\nI graduated from Northern Illinois University with two business degrees. College \nwas a five-year prenatal employee brainwashing with graduation as the overrated \nclimax. I viewed college as indoctrination into corporate droneship; an unfulfilled \nmarriage between me and a life of jobs, bosses, and being overworked and under-\npaid. My friends were hired for great jobs and bragged about it:\n“I work for Motorola.”\n“I got a job at Northwestern Insurance!”\n“Hertz Rental Cars hired me as a training manager!”\nWhile I was happy for them, my friends bought into the “Slowlane” lie. Me? \nThanks but no thanks. I sought to avoid the Slowlane like a medieval plague. My \nidea was to find the Fastlane, retire rich, and retire young.\nr oadb Locks, de Tours, and de Pression\nDespite the confidence, the next few years fell horribly short of my expecta -\ntions. I lived with my mother as I bounced from one business venture to another. \nSuccess was absent. Every month was a different business: vitamins, jewelry, some \nhot “turnkey” marketing program purchased from the back of a business magazine, \nor some goofy long-distance network marketing gig. \nDespite the hard work, my record of failures grew, as did my mounting debts. \nYears passed and folly fermented as I was forced to take a series of Neanderthal jobs \nthat crippled my ego: a busboy at a Chinese restaurant (yes, there are cockroaches in \nthe back), a day laborer in the slums of Chicago, pizza-delivery boy, flower-delivery \nboy, dispatcher, limo driver, early morning newspaper delivery for the Chicago \nTribune, Subway sandwich restaurant salesman (WTF?), Sears stock clerk (in the \nfreaking drapery department), charity can collector, and house painter.\nThe only thing worse than these shitty jobs and their pay? The hours. Most\n\f\n11\npART 1 — weAlTh in A wheelchAiR: “geT Rich slow” is geT Rich oldrequired a predawn start . . . 3 a.m., 4 a.m. . . . if any ungodly hour was involved \nyou could bet my job required it. Five years of college and I graduated to live like a \ndairy farmer. Hell, money was so tight that I prostituted myself to an older woman \nto pay for my best friend’s wedding gift. Yes, cougars preyed in the 1990s.\nMeanwhile, my friends progressed in their careers: They got their 4% yearly pay \nincreases. They bought their Mustangs and Acuras and their 1,200-square-foot \ntownhouses. They appeared to be content and lived the expectant life preordained \nby society. They were normal and I wasn’t.\nAt 26 years old, I fell into depression; my businesses were not self-sufficient \nand neither was I. Seasonal depression gnawed at my fractured psyche. Chicago’s \nrainy, dark, dreary weather made me crave the comfort of a warm bed and tasty \npastries. Accomplishments were preceded by sunshine; so yes, I wasn’t accom -\nplishing much. Tired of the high-school dropout jobs, I struggled to get out of \nbed, and doubt became the daily affirmation. Physically, emotionally, and finan -\ncially exhausted from failure, I knew my results weren’t indicative of my true self. \nI knew the Fastlane way to wealth but just couldn’t get it executed. What was \nI doing wrong? What was holding me back? After all these years of research and \neducation, complete with a closet full of books, magazines, and “quick start” vid -\neos, I was still no closer to wealth. I sat stalled on the sidewalk with the Fastlane \nnowhere in sight.\nMy deep depression sunk me into escapes, but instead of drugs, sex, or alcohol, \nI lost myself in books and kept studying fameless millionaires. If I couldn’t be suc-\ncessful, I’d escape into the lives of those who were by absorbing books of the rich, \nautobiographies of the successful, and other rags-to-riches tales.\nBut it got worse. The people in my life gave up on me. My long-time girlfriend \nproclaimed, “You have no resolve.” She had a safe and secure job with a rental \ncar agency, but we’d argue because she worked long hours for chump change, a \nwhopping $28,000 a year. Of course, she rightly retorted with the facts: “You \ndon’t have a job, you make $27,000 less than me, and none of your businesses \nwork.” She was a smart cat. Our relationship ended as she found courtship with \na corporate radio ad executive.\nAnd then there was my mother. For the first years after college, she cut me slack, \nbut then came the failures and the goofy jobs. I begged patience and pleaded that \nwealth creation for a Fastlane entrepreneur operates under an exponential scale—\nthose who hold jobs operate under a linear scale. Unfortunately, it didn’t matter \nhow great my charts and diagrams were; mom lost faith and I didn’t blame her. \nLanding a man on Mars showed more promise. \nHer directives dulled my drive. She’d shout, “Get a job, baby!” at least 20 \ntimes a week. Ugh, even today I shudder. That phrase, shouted in that voice, could \nexterminate cockroaches in a post-apocalyptic world. There were days I’d want \nto pound my head into a vise and crush my ears into deafness. “Get a job, baby!”"

The \nfour aspirins I chased two hours earlier had no effect. I wanted to get home but \ncouldn’t. I was stuck in a blizzard and my usual routes were snowed in.

Ground zero for my \nnew life was a small studio apartment in central Phoenix that rented for $475 per \nmonth. I transformed my studio apartment into an office. No bedroom set, no \nfurniture, just a mattress that invaded the kitchen. I slept with Pop Tart crumbs, \na side effect of laying a mattress next to the kitchen counter.\nI lived poor and without security, but I felt rich. I was in control of my life.\nOne of the many businesses I created was a Web site. While driving that limo \nin Chicago, sometimes I’d sit idle for hours and had plenty of downtime to read \nbooks. I didn’t waste that time. While I waited for clients at the airport or while \nthey got obliterated at the local watering hole, I sat in the limo and read. And \nread. I studied everything from finance to Internet programming to more auto -\nbiographies of the rich.\nThe limo job did something special: it put me at the forefront of an unsolved \nneed that needed a solution. One of my limo clients asked if I knew of any good \nlimo companies in New York. I dropped the passenger off at the airport, but he \nleft me with a seed of invention. If I lived in Chicago and needed a limo in New \nYork, where would I go to find it? I didn’t have a New York Yellow Pages handy, \nand surely no one else outside of New York did either. Faced with this question, \nI concluded that other travelers would have the same challenge.

But, like my prior businesses, it didn’t make a lot of money. However, \nnow it was different. I was naked in a strange town with no money, job, or safety \nnet. I had to focus.\nI aggressively marketed my Web site. I sent out emails. Cold-called. Mailed \nletters. I learned search engine optimization (SEO). Because I couldn’t afford books, \nI visited the Phoenix library daily and studied Internet programming languages. \nI improved my Web site and learned about graphics and copywriting. Anything \nthat could help me, I consumed. \nThen one day I had a breakthrough; I received a call from a company in Kansas \nthat raved about my Web site service and wanted me to design its Web site. While \nmy focus wasn’t web design, I obliged for a price of $400. They thought the price \nwas a steal, and within 24 hours, I had built the company its Web site. I was ecstatic. \nIn 24 hours, I had most of my rent payment. Then, coincidentally, not 24 hours \nlater, I received another call from a company in New York asking for the same \nthing, a new Web site. I designed it for $600 and it took me two days to complete. \nI had another rent payment!\nNow, I know this isn’t a lot of money, but from poverty to $1,000 in three days \nfelt like winning the 50-million-dollar Powerball.

I was purely self-employed! \nI was momentous acceleration, a wind at my back that foreshadowed a directional \nchange into a new universe of wealth generation.\nBut something still wasn’t right. Something was missing and I knew it. Most \nof my income was attached to my Web site designs and not my Web site advertis-\ning business. My income was tied to my time, the construction of Web sites. More \nWeb sites jobs meant more time spent, and if I didn’t work, my income would stop. \nMy time was being sold off for money. \na n ew w eaLTh e qua Tion y ieLds w eaLTh a cceL era Tion\nIn the winter, a friend visited from Chicago. I showed him my web directory and he \nwas amazed at all the traffic my service received. I’d get limo price inquiries from \naround the world, every minute of the day. How much for a limo from Boston to \nWorcester? How much from JFK to Manhattan? We’d scan my email inbox and it \nhad 450 emails. Ten minutes passed, click refresh, and then there would be another \n30 emails. Emails were pouring in several per minute. He suggested “Dude! Turn \nthose emails into money somehow.”\nHe was right, but how? And how can it solve a legitimate need? He left me with \nthis challenge and I was intent to solve it. Days later, I created a risky, unproven \nsolution and I gave it a shot. What did I do? Instead of selling ad space I decided \nto sell leads. There was a problem though. This “revenue model” was new and \ngroundbreaking. Additionally, I had to convince my customers that this method \nof business was beneficial to them, and I had no data to predict whether it could \nsucceed. Remember, this was the late nineties, when “lead generation” in Web \nspace was unfounded, at least until I went out and did it.\nNonetheless, I took the risk and implemented it. In the short term, I expected \nthe change to kill my income and it did. I predicted its success would take months, \nif it worked at all. The first month the new system generated $473. Yikes. I built more \nWeb sites to fill my income gap. The second month’s revenues were $694. Third \nmonth, $970. Then $1,832. $2,314. $3,733.

I didn’t have a job; I had a passion to make a difference. Thousands \nof people benefited from something I created, which addicted me to the process. \nI made a difference!\nI started to compile testimonials from clients.\n“Because of you, my business grew tenfold.”\n“Your Web site led me to my biggest corporate client.”\n“Your company has been instrumental in growing my business.”\nThis feedback was wealth currency. I wasn’t awash in riches quite yet, but I felt \nrich. \nmy “Faked” s hor Tcu T To w eaLTh\nIn 2000, my telephone rang with a different type of inquiry. Technology startups \ncalled; they wanted to know if I would sell my business. In that year, the dot-com \nfrenzy was in full force. Not a day went by without a tall tale about some dot-com \nmillionaire who struck it rich by selling a tech property. Remember the fame -\nless millionaires? This subset of the rich grew at a staggering rate, and the wave \nswelled my way.\nSo, did I want to sell my company? Hell yes! I had three offers to sell. Offer 1: \n$250,000. Offer 2: $550,000. Offer 3: $1,200,000. I accepted offer three and became \na millionaire . . . instantly . . . well, almost.\nIt didn’t last. At the time, I thought $1.2 million dollars was a lot of money. \nIt wasn’t. Taxes. Worthless stock options. I made mistakes and invested poorly. \nI bought a Corvette, hoping it would make me look rich. I thought I was rich, but \nI really wasn’t. By the time it was over, I had less than $300,000 left.\nThe tech bubble arrived with unforgiving consequences, at least for buyers \nof my company. Against my recommendations, they made poor decisions, deci -\nsions that were good for short term revenue but horrific for long-term growth. \nThey flushed money down the toilet as if there were an endless supply. Do we \nreally need custom-branded water bottles? And logo T-shirts? Are these revenue-\ngenerating actions? \nDecisions were made slowly and by committee. Customers were ignored. \nIncredulously, most of the company’s executive management had Harvard MBAs, \nproof that the business logic doesn’t come with expensive initials after your name. \nDespite having $12 million in venture capital to buoy the storm, my Web site \nslowly started to die. \nA few months later, near the cliff of bankruptcy, it was voted that my Web site \nwould be dissolved, even though it was still profitable. Tech buyers dried up and \nstocks were in the tank. Everyone was on life support, including them.\n\f\n16\nthe millionaire fastlane Unwilling to watch my creation fade into oblivion, I offered to repurchase \nmy Web site at a firesale price—a mere $250,000, financed by its own profit. The \noffer was accepted and I regained control of the same company I had just sold a \nyear earlier. Essentially, I’d operate the business, take the profit and pay down \nthe carry-back loan. What was left over I reinvested into the business. With my \ncompany back in my control, a new motivation surfaced—to not only survive the \ndot-com crash, but to thrive.\nThe b ir Th o F The m oney Tree\nThe next 18 months I was revitalized to take my service to the next level. In hindsight, \nI wanted to prove to myself that I wasn’t just some lucky chap who got caught up in \nthe dot-com boom. I continued to improve my Web site. I integrated new technolo-\ngies and listened to customers. My new passion was automation and process.\nAs I streamlined my processes and systems, a slow and steady transformation \ntook place. I worked less and less. Suddenly, I worked an hour a day instead of ten. \nYet, the money rolled in. I’d go to Vegas on a gambling spree; the money rolled in. \nI’d be sick for four days; the money rolled in. I’d daytrade for a month; the money \nrolled in. I’d take a month off; the money rolled in.\nThen I realized what I achieved. This was the Fastlane. I built myself a real, liv-\ning, fruit-bearing money tree. It was a flourishing money tree that made money 24 \nhours a day, 7 days a week, and it didn’t require my life for the trade. It required \na few hours a month of water and sunshine, which I happily provided. Outside of \nroutine attention, this money tree grew, produced fruit, and gave me the freedom \nto do whatever I wanted.\nFor the next few years I lived a life of laziness and gluttony. Sure, I worked a \nfew hours a month, but mostly, I worked out, traveled, played video games, bought \nand raced fast cars, entertained myself with dating Web sites, gambled—I was free \nbecause I had a money tree that surrogated  for my time and yielded a bountiful \nmonthly harvest.\nSince reclaiming my business, it grew meteorically. Some months I’d PROFIT \nmore than $200,000. Yes, profit! A bad month was $100,000. I earned in two \nweeks what most people earned in an entire year. Wealth poured in and I was \nflying low on the radar . . . no fame. If you earned $200,000 every month, how \nwould your life change?\n • What would you drive? \n • Where would you live?\n • What vacations would you take? \n • What schools would your children attend? \n • Would debt be a noose around your neck?"

    "raw_text": "Part 2\nWealth is Not a Road, \nBut a Road Trip!\n\f\n\n\f\n21\n3\nThe Road Trip to Wealth\nThe journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step.\n~ Lao Tzu \nw eaLTh i s a r oad Tri P, n o T Jus T a r oad!\nWhile in college, my friends and I embarked on a spring break road trip from \nChicago to South Florida. Naturally, as young men, we were gushing with anticipa-\ntion and enamored with the destination: a sunny, crowded Florida beach of scant-\nily clad, well-tanned, boozed-up college coeds. Unfortunately, preoccupied with \nthe destination, we failed to address the journey and the vehicle that we relied on \nto get us there. Eight hours into the trip, our old Dodge Duster started billowing \nsmoke and clanked to a stop. With a ruptured gasket and no oil, our trip stalled \non some country road in the middle of southern Illinois. Cows, manure stink, and \ncornfields, light years away from the sandy beaches of South Florida. \nSadly, for most, the journey to wealth often ends like my spring break road trip: \nstalled on the side of the road in the middle of nowhere, left to ask, “How the hell \ndid I get here?” Like my spring break trip, to know and drive “the road to wealth” \nis not enough because the road itself is deficient in delivering wealth. Your pursuit \nof wealth stalls when your focus is the road and its destination, and not the road \ntrip. Sure, the Fastlane might open a rapid road to wealth, but a successful road trip \nwill demand your respect for all of the trip’s vital tools. My spring break stalled \nbecause we neglected the road trip and focused on the road. Oil? Roadmap? Engine \ntune-up? Screw it, just hit the road and head south! When you disregard critical \nroad trip components, your engine redlines, oil burns stale, gas is squandered, \nand decade-long detours are encountered. When your focus is only the road, your \njourney is likely to stall and dreamy destinations never arrive.\n\f\n22\nthe millionaire fastlane w eaLT h’s iLL usionary r oad\nIf wealth has escaped you, it’s probably because you are “road-focused” and not \nusing the whole formula. Sure, you might have bits and pieces: an ingredient cap-\ntured from a book or two, another seeded by some “get rich” seminar or a hot stock \ntip from your broke college buddy. Unfortunately, these isolated ingredients can’t \ncreate wealth and are likened to a car stuck on the road to wealth with an empty \ngas tank and a dead battery. You can’t crack wealth’s code with one variable in a \nmulti-variable equation.\nWealth’s road trip formula is like a recipe. \nImagine if I threw you into the kitchen with sugar and flour and ordered you \nto bake cookies. The feat is impossible because two ingredients alone don’t make \nthe entire formula. Forget the baking soda and the cookies won’t rise. Remove \nthe butter and the cookies taste awful. One forgotten or flawed ingredient and \nthe process fails. Therein lies the fault with most wealth books: They are “road-\nfocused.” They specialize on the most titillating part of the formula—the sugar! \nThey tell you:\n • Buy foreclosures to get rich! \n • Buy a franchise and be your own boss! \n • Learn the mystical secret law and think positive! \n • Start a business! \n • Invest in real estate for passive income!\n • Trade your way to riches with currencies! \nThese strategies highlight various roads to wealth: the real estate road, the trad-\ning road, and the business road. They address nothing else. The failure is within \nthe “else” because the else is the rest of the formula.\nmiLLionaires a re Forged by Process, no T by eV en Ts\nAll self-made multimillionaires create their wealth by a carefully orchestrated \nprocess. They have and use the entire formula. Despite what you may have read \nor heard, wealth is not an event. Wealth doesn’t drop from the sky or come from \na game show. It doesn’t ring the doorbell and await you on the front porch with \nballoons and a check the size of a refrigerator. Wealth does not chime from a \nmachine with spinning bars, lemons, and cherries. \nWealth is a process, not an event. Ask any chef and they will confirm that the \nperfect dish is a series of ingredients and a well-engineered process of execution: \na little of this, a little of that, done at the right time at the right place, and wham, \nyou have a tasty meal. Wealth creation has the same method of execution—a fab -\nricated accumulation of many disassociated ingredients into an assembled whole \nthat has value and is worth millions.\n\f\n23\npART 2 — weAlTh is noT A RoAd, buT A RoAd TRip!Wealth eludes most people because they are preoccupied with events while dis-\nregarding process. Without process, there is no event. Take a moment and reread \nthat. Process makes millionaires, and the events you see and hear are the results of \nthat process. For our chef, the cooking is the process, while the meal  is the event.\nFor example, an athlete who scores a $50-million-dollar contract to play pro \nbasketball is an event from process. You see and hear about the big contract, the \nspectacular “get-rich” event, but you typically ignore the process that preceded \nthe event. The process was the long, arduous road you didn’t witness: The daily \nfour-hour practices, the midnight pickup basketball games, the torn ligaments, \nthe surgery and rehabilitation, the rejection of being cut from the junior varsity \nteam, and the resistance to the neighborhood gangs, all fabricates the journey \nthat forms process. \nWhen a 20-year-old sells his Internet company for $30 million dollars, you \nread about it on a tech blog. The event is lauded and showcased for all to admire. \nSidelined is the process—you didn’t hear about the long hours of coding the \nfounder had to endure. You don’t hear about the cold dark days working in the \ngarage. You don’t hear about how the company was founded on credit cards at \n21.99% interest. You don’t hear about the founder and his rusty P.O.S. Toyota \nwith 174,000 miles. \nWhen J. Darius Bikoff founded Glaceau Vitamin Water in 1996 and 11 years \nlater Coca-Cola offers him $4.1 billion for the company, the offer makes headline \nnews around the world. What doesn’t? The 11 years of struggle forged by a sharp -\nened process. The billion-dollar offer is the event—the process is the struggle and \nthe backstory.\nThe sale of my company climaxed in an event, but its fruition was carved by \nprocess. Outsiders see the nice house and the expensive cars and might think, \n“Wow, if I only could be so lucky.” Such a belief is a mirage of event over process. \nAll events of wealth are preceded by process, a backstory of trial, risk, hard work, \nand sacrifice. If you try to skip process, you’ll never experience events. \nUnfortunately, as a media-driven, “I want it now” society, we spotlight and \nglorify the event, but usher the process behind the woodshed, carefully drying \nits sweat from the public cognition. However, if you search long and hard, you \ncan always find the process, buried in another story or in the trailing paragraphs \nthat glorify the event.\nWhen you make your first million, it will be because of process and not some \nclandestine happenstance that just happened to waltz across your path. Process is \nthe road trip to wealth: The destination shines as an event, but it’s found by process. \nYes, the elevator to success is out-of-order—you will need to climb the stairs.\n\f\n24\nthe millionaire fastlane w eaLTh’s r oad Tri P Formu La\nThe formula for wealth’s road trip is like a long road trip across the country. Success \ndemands your focused exercise into the journey and the tools of that journey (pro-\ncess) as opposed to the destination (event). There are four constituent ingredients \nthat make up the winning formula. They are:\nyour r oadmap (Parts 3, 4, and 5)\nThe compass for the trip—your roadmap—is the guiding force behind your actions. \nYour roadmap makes up your financial belief system and your preconceived con -\nvictions about wealth and money. There are three roadmaps that will chart your \ncourse to wealth: \n1) The Sidewalk\n2)  The Slowlane\n3) The Fastlane\nMuch like a recipe, your roadmap will outline why, where, how, and what. \nyour Vehicle (Part 6)\nYour vehicle is you. No one can drive the journey but you. Your vehicle is a com -\nplicated system composed of oil, gas, an engine, a steering wheel, a windshield, \nhorsepower, and an accelerator—all needing frequent tuning and maintenance \nto ensure peak efficiency during the road trip.\nyour r oads (Part 7)\nYour roads are the financial pathways you travel. For example, you can travel the \njob road, and within that road you have limitless choices: You can be an engineer, \na project manager, a physician, a plumber, a truck driver. Then there are entrepre-\nneurial roads: You can be a real estate investor, a retail storeowner, a franchiser, \nan Internet marketer, or an inventor. Just like a road trip across the country, roads \nare plentiful with millions of permutations. \nyour s peed (Part 8)\nSpeed is execution and your ability to go from idea to implementation. You could \nsit in a Ferrari on an empty, straight road, but if you fail to hit the accelerator, you \nfail to move. Without speed, your roadmap has no direction, your vehicle stands \nidle, and your road mutates into a dead end. \nThe r oad Tri P i s Pa Ved wi Th To LL r oads\nSuccessful Fastlane travelers are warriors who live and die on rough roads.

Unfortunately, some feel \nthat wealth’s toll can be paid by entitlements or certain “prerequisites,” such as:\n • A functional family/good childhood \n • “Hard work” versus “smart work” \n • Educational accomplishments and credentials after your name\n • A stellar business plan \n • Venture capital \n • Being a certain sex, color, or age \n • Wishing, dreaming, and thinking positively\n • Knowing the right people in the right places \n • Attending the right schools\n • Being passionate or “doing what you love”\nNothing is further from the truth. The Millionaire Fastlane doesn’t care about \nthese things. The Fastlane isn’t a straight and smooth tree-lined street with white \npicket fences and children swinging on tires hanging from oak trees. It’s a dark, \ndeserted, unpaved road strewn with potholes that forces change and evolution. If \nthe road trip to wealth were easy, wouldn’t everyone be wealthy? \nExpect a price to be paid. Expect risk and sacrifice. Expect bumps in the road. \nWhen you hit the first pothole (and yes, it will happen) know that you are forging \nthe process of your unfolding story. The Fastlane process demands sacrifices that \nfew make, to resolve to live like few can. \nThe r oad Tri P c an’ T be o u Tsourced To a c hau FFeur\nWe live in a society that wants to outsource everything, from our household \nchores to raising our kids. Outsourcing might work for a dirty bathroom, but it \ndoesn’t work for wealth. Wealth’s road trip has no chauffeur and the toll can’t be \noutsourced to a virtual assistant in India.\nHad someone gifted a Lamborghini to me (or any dream) when I was 16 years \nold, I can guarantee you I wouldn’t be where I am today. When someone grants \nyou your desires without you exerting any effort, you effectively handicap process. \nThe person I needed to become would have been dwarfed because process would \nhave been outsourced. There is no wisdom or personal growth gained in a journey \nthat someone else does for you. The journey is yours.\nc ha PTer s ummary: Fas TLane d is Tinc Tions\n • Wealth is a formula, not an ingredient.\n • Process makes millionaires. Events are by-products of process.\n • To seek a “wealth chauffeur” is to seek a surrogate for process. Process cannot \nbe outsourced, because process dawns wisdom, personal growth, strength, \nand events.\n\f\n26\n4\nThe Roadmaps to Wealth\nIf you don’t know where you are going, any road will get you there.\n~ Lewis Carroll\nThe c om Pass F or w eaLTh\nIf you don’t know where you are going, how will you know if you get there? If your \ndestination is undefined, undoubtedly you’ll never arrive and likely end in a place \nyou don’t want to be. Wealth is found with a roadmap, not a dartboard. \nSelf-made millionaires don’t become millionaires by stumbling into money, \njust as financial failures don’t become failures by stumbling into poorness. Both \nare the direct result of the financial roadmap chosen and the actions and beliefs \nthat evolve from that roadmap. Your financial roadmap is definitive to process, \nand it’s the first tool for your road trip to wealth. \nYour current financial situation is a product of your existing roadmap, whether \nchosen or not. Your roadmap guides your actions, and the consequences of those \nactions have created your financial life. How your life unfolds is determined by \nyour choices, and these choices originate from your belief systems, and those belief \nsystems evolve from your predisposed roadmap. If you want to change your life, \nchange your choices. To change your choices you must change your belief system. \nYour belief system is defined by your roadmap. \nHow do beliefs affect finances? Beliefs precede choices, which precede action. \nFor example, if you believe “rich people got rich investing in mutual funds” your \nactions will reflect that belief. If some financial guru tells you to cancel your credit \ncards because “all debt is bad,” you do it. If an author says, “$50 invested today \nwill be worth $10 million in 40 years,” and you believe it, your actions reflect \nthat belief. \nBeliefs are powerful mechanisms that drive action, whether true or not.

We believe what we’re taught until we gather evidence to the \ncontrary. \nYour belief system acts like a roadmap, a compass that, if errant, can lead you \nto a lifetime of detours. Fictitious beliefs are lying roadmaps; they escort you down \ndead-end roads where “Wealth: Next Exit” never happens.\nThe Three Financia L r oadma Ps To w eaLTh\nPlotting your course to wealth and building your process starts with an exami -\nnation of your current financial roadmap and the alternatives. There are three \nfinancial roadmaps:\nThe sidewalk r oadmap\nThe slowlane r oadmap\nThe Fastlane r oadmap\nWithin these three roadmaps lies a psychology, a belief system that dictates \nactions relative to each roadmap. More importantly, each roadmap operates within \na “universe” governed by a mathematical “wealth equation.” Whatever roadmap \nyou choose, your universe for wealth creation will abide by each map’s respective \nwealth equation. Additionally, each roadmap is naturally predisposed toward a \nspecific destination. Those predispositions are:\nThe sidewalk >— Poorness \nThe slowlane >— m ediocrity \nThe Fastlane >— w ealth\nWhichever financial roadmap you follow will predispose you to the destination \ninherent in the roadmap—the roadmap’s “true essence.”\nWhat is true essence? If you play blackjack and win 15 consecutive hands, you \nviolate the true essence of randomness. The natural state of randomness is to not \ndeliver 15 wins in a row. When a wild African lion is tamed to perform in a Las \nVegas magic act, the lion is trained to violate its true essence. The lion naturally \nwants to be wild, to hunt, to kill, to feed, to mate. The lion wants to revert to its \nnatural self, which is why some flamboyant magicians get their heads bitten off. \nYou have to be special to bend the laws of true essence. \nSimilarly, the roadmaps each possess a true essence that leads either to poor -\nness, mediocrity, or wealth. For example, if you follow the Sidewalk, you’ll likely \nend poor. While wealth is possible using any of the maps, finding it via a roadmap \nnot predisposed to wealth is improbable.\n\f\n28\nthe millionaire fastlane Each roadmap contains key mindsets that act as signposts, or “mindposts,” that \nprovide direction and guide actions, just like a roadmap. Those mindposts are:\ndebt Perception: Does debt control you or do you control your debt? \nTime Perception:  How is your time valued and treated? Abundant? Fleeting? \nInconsequential? \neducation Perception: What role does education have in your life? \nmoney Perception:  What is money’s role in your life? Is money a tool or a toy? \nPlentiful or scarce?\nPrimary income source: What is your primary means of creating income?\nPrimary w ealth a ccelerator:  How are you accelerating your net worth and \ncreating wealth? Or are you?\nwealth Perception:  How do you define wealth? \nwealth equation: What is your mathematical plan for accumulating wealth? \nWhat wealth equation defines the physics of your wealth universe?\ndestination:  Is there a destination? If so, what does it look like?\nr esponsibility & c ontrol: Are you in control of your life and your financial \nplan? \nLife Perception:  How do you live your life? Do you plan for the future? Forsake \ntoday for tomorrow? Or tomorrow for today? \nThe r oadma Ps oP era Te wi Thin d is Tinc T u ni Verses\nEach roadmap operates under a specific set of mathematical formulas, the wealth \nequation that determines the speed at which you can create wealth. Like Einstein’s \nE=MC², these formulas govern your wealth universe much like physics governs \nour universe. And because physics is bound by mathematical absolutes, so are \nyour equations (and probabilities) to wealth. \nThe velocity of wealth acceleration evolves from your chosen roadmap’s “uni-\nverse,” and it is within these universes that your financial plan accelerates or stalls. \nThink of it as a railroad track, with each track having its own set of speeds, rules,"

One business deal from broke. One gig from broke. One layoff from \nbroke. On the Sidewalk, you’re always “one something” from being homeless, \nbankrupt, or back living in your parent’s basement. \nYes, some Sidewalkers actually earn large incomes, but none of them ever \nobtains true wealth. Don’t let the contradiction fool you. The Sidewalk doesn’t \nhave an exit ramp to wealth—only a “DEAD END” sign signaling impending doom. \nThe Sidewalker’s road trip is a financial treadmill with a destination that typically \nceases at bankruptcy or a crisis of reckoning. \nw ha T i s a s idewa Lker?\nA Sidewalker’s financial destination doesn’t exist. The plan is to have no plan.  \nSurplus money is immediately spent on the next great gadget, the next trip, the\n\f\n34\nthe millionaire fastlane next newer car, the next fashionable styles, or the next hot fad. Sidewalkers are \ncarelessly trapped in a “Lifestyle Servitude” fed by an urgent, insatiable need for \npleasure, image, and instant gratification. This perpetuates a cascading cycle that \nspins faster every month, increasing the velocity of the burden, forever enslaving \nthe Sidewalker to their job or their business.\nThe Sidewalk is the road most traveled because it’s the path of least resistance. \nIts siren song is instant gratification, and money is a hot potato that’s quickly \nexchanged for the latest fix of the day. Want to witness how Sidewalkers live and \nthink? Watch the television show Judge Judy for a few hours. Daughters suing moms \nfor $100, people denying responsibility, consequence ignorance, people wanting \nrent for free. Seriously, the show should be renamed Life from the Sidewalk .\nThe m ind Pos Ts o F a s idewa Lker\nThe Sidewalker’s roadmap contains behavioral characteristics that drive the \nSidewalker’s actions.

This data unmasks the ugliness behind the Botox injec -\ntions and the luxury German sedans: Sidewalkers are the majority. An estimated \n60% of adults live their lives on the sidewalk. Yes, the world is full of financial \nillusionists. Once the recent financial crises are factored in, the latest figures will \ndevolve into chilling depths; I estimate that 85% of American families will have \nzero or negative net worth. But you can bet that they have 650 cable channels \nstreaming into their five flat-screen HDTVs.

How many people have lost their homes due to \nthe current economic crisis? Their savings, their jobs, or their 401 Ks? The Sidewalk \noffers no protection, because you’re naked and you can’t absorb the hits. If you’re \nhit by traffic, you’re roadkill. If you want to be unshakable on your financial road \ntrip, you have to get tough and strap on a bulletproof vest and have a plan that \ntranscends years, not days. \nA life on the Sidewalk naturally pulls you to poorness. Because the Sidewalk is \nabout the short term, it never works for the long term. Your future becomes a mort-\ngage for a pleasant present. Unfortunately, any bump in the road causes the loans of \nthe Sidewalk to be called in: a recession, a job loss, an interest rate hike, a mortgage \nreset. Living on the Sidewalk can literally end in living on the sidewalk.\nIf you ask any derailed Sidewalker what spun his financial life out of control, he \nwill quickly blame some external factor: I was laid off! My car broke down! I had \nno health insurance when I broke my foot! The judge ordered a 20% increase in \nalimony! When you rev your financial engine at the redline you’re guaranteed to \nburnout. And then, ironically, your pleasant todays turn into horrible tomorrows: \nmore work, more debt, and more stress.\nI don’t know your age, but let’s be honest and ask the uncomfortable question: \nCan you seriously expect to retire on $13,000 in net worth? Or $113,000? Is it \nrational to think you can live off your home equity refinance? Have you thought \nbeyond next week’s paycheck? At what threshold do you realize that it’s time to \nshift gears and reevaluate? Is there a threshold? Why would something that you’ve \nbeen doing for 5, 10, 20 years suddenly start working? Yes, insanity is doing the \nsame things repeatedly and expecting different results.\nThe Sidewalk is not a road to wealth unless your strategy is casinos, lottery \ntickets, or some poison-your-spouse insurance scheme. Government aid, social \nsecurity, charity, and “my parents will soon die and leave me a fortune” inheritance \nis not a financial plan! If you don’t want to work at Kmart until you’re 75 years old \nor you don’t want to retire under a bridge in a cardboard box, you have to have a \nplan. Should life grant you another 50 years, what the heck is your plan?!\nThe first step to escape the Sidewalk is recognizing that you might be on it . . . \nthen replace it with something that works!\nmoney d oesn’ T s oLV e money Prob Lems\nNewsflash: The Sidewalk is money blind. It doesn’t care about how much money \nyou make. You can’t medicate poor money management with more money. Yes, \nyou can look filthy rich and still be riding the Sidewalk dirty. \nSidewalkers come from all walks of life, even those with the visual embodiments \nof wealth. They own businesses, they work high-paying careers like medicine or law, \nor they live as successful actors or musicians and earn big incomes. The common\n\f\n39\npART 3 — pooRness: The sidewAlk RoAdmApdenominator remains consistent: There is no plan, no savings—spend more than \nyou earn and trade a secure tomorrow for a “living large” lifestyle of today. \nA Sidewalker’s wealth equation is determined by income plus debt, determined \nby available credit. \nWealth = Income + Debt\nSidewalkers create their lifestyle in direct proportion to their income and \nsupplement that lifestyle with extensive use of debt. All Sidewalkers stress about \npaying their mortgage or rent, paying the utility bills, meeting the minimum pay-\nments on their credit cards—it’s just what happens when there is no thought given \npast the happy hour after payday.\nThe aFFL uen T s idewa Lker: i ncome- r ich\nWhen an income-rich Sidewalker goes broke it makes big news. Have you ever \nwondered how a rich rapper can go broke three years after his last album? Or why \na famous actor needs to file bankruptcy a few years removed from the public spot-\nlight? How does one transform an $80-million NBA  contract into the oblivion of \nbankruptcy? I’ll tell you: The Sidewalk where wealth equals income plus debt.\nYou don’t have to look hard to find an “Income-Rich” Sidewalker. These are \npeople who look rich, but in reality are one paycheck, one album, or one movie \nfailure from broke. They make large incomes, with every dime spent on the next \nlavish accoutrement. Their lifestyle is accelerated by a big income and a big credit \nline. Yes, after their big income is spent, they buy more things they don’t need with \nmoney they don’t have, trusting fully that their large incomes will go on forever. \nI laughably refer to Sidewalkers as “all credit cards.” They drive nice cars \nand wear expensive clothes, but are one blown gasket away from a total financial \nmeltdown. \nA member of the Fastlane Forum (TheFastlaneForum.com) posted this slice of \nSidewalking overhead from a friend who works at a lending agency:\n“A famous rapper was denied a loan for $60,000 . . . despite putting on \nhis application that he was making $400,000 per month . . . yet, after hav-\ning two hits in the past year, he must be broke. He also had a terrible credit \nscore. Goes to show you, money management skills and having good credit \nare very important, even when you are having a ton of success.”\nSince Income-Rich Sidewalkers earn big incomes, having designer clothes, \naccessories, and hobbies are commensurate with their earnings. For example, if \nan Income-Rich Sidewalker earns $20,000 a month, they feel justified in buying \na pair of $300 jeans. The problem is that, just like Income-Poor Sidewalkers, an\n\f\nIncome-Rich Sidewalker’s spending isn’t satisfied until they’ve burned through \ntheir entire monthly income plus some. It’s an irrational way to live, as if these \npeople fear that not spending the money will cause it to disappear. Earn $50,000 \na month? Spend $60,000. Earn $250,000? Spend $350,000. The money outflow \nalways outpaces the money inflow.\nSomeone who earns $2 million a year is susceptible to the same Sidewalking \npitfalls as someone who earns $20,000! Financial discipline is blind to income. \nLack of financial discipline resides on the Sidewalk and it doesn’t care what you \nearn or what you drive. \nThe i ncome/ w eaLTh m irage o F The s idewa Lk\nNotice how both income-poor and income-rich sidewalkers share the same prob-\nlems but different scenery. The reason is, more money is not a solution to poor \nfinancial management . Poor money management is like gambling at a casino, \nbecause, over time, the house always wins. Tossing more money at the deficiency \nis like trying to plug a hole in a dam with more water. More money doesn’t buy \nfinancial discipline.\nThose lacking financial discipline misuse money to delay the inevitable. If you \ncan’t live on $40,000 a year, you won’t be able to live on $400,000 a year. While \nyou might fret about your $900 mortgage payment, the income-rich Sidewalker \nfrets about his $9,000 mortgage payment. The fretting is alike; the problems are \nthe same, only the amounts differ. Only a mindset change regarding money is \na solution to money problems. To change your mindset, you must change your \nroadmap. Get off the Sidewalk and stop equating wealth to income and debt. \nc ha PTer s ummary: Fas TLane d is Tinc Tions\n • A first-class ticket to the Sidewalk is to have no financial plan.\n • The Sidewalk’s natural gravitational pull is poorness, both in time and money. \n • You cannot solve poor financial management with more money. \n • You can be income rich and still ride the Sidewalk dirty.\n • If wealth is defined by income and debt, wealth is an illusion, because it is \nvulnerable to potholes, detours, and “bumps in the road.” When the income \ndisappears, so does the illusion of wealth.\n • Poor financial management is like gambling; the house eventually wins.\n\f\n41\n6\nHas Your Wealth Been Toxified?\nWealth is the ability to fully experience life.\n~ Henry David Thoreau\nsocie Ty’s To XiFica Tion oF  w eaLTh\nThe lure of the Sidewalk evolves from society’s poisonous and toxic corruption of \nwealth. Society has resolutely declared wealth’s definition for you: “Wealth” is a \nchauffeur-driven Rolls Royce, chartered jets, exotic trips to the South Pacific, a \nmansion on the bay, and a penthouse in Las Vegas. Society says wealth is six-carat \ndiamond earrings, Aston Martins, and watches that cost more than most people’s \nhomes. Society says wealth is an Indecent Proposal to buy a romp in the sack with \nDemi Moore for $1 million based on the argument “the night will come and go, \nbut the money will last a lifetime.” How am I doing? Sound like wealth?\nAsk 10 people “what is wealth?” and you’ll hear 10 different answers. Your \n“wealth” might be symbolized by a Lamborghini like it was for me, or it might be \na farm on 70 acres in Montana and a stable full of race horses. If you think like \nmost, “wealth” is instinctually defined by lavish luxury lifestyles.\nSociety has conditioned us to believe that wealth is an absolute construct per -\nfected by material possessions. In fact, I’ve had to tailor the “hook” of this book \nto society’s definition of wealth over the real definition. Why the misdirection? \nLike Pavlov’s dogs, you’ve been trained to respond to it. You see, society has done \na fabulous job of defining wealth for you, and unfortunately, they (again) have \nmisled you. But don’t worry; if you want luxury, the Fastlane can deliver.\nThe w eaLTh Trini Ty: w ha T i s w eaLTh?\nWealth isn’t as ambiguous as it may seem. The happiest moments in my life \nwere when I felt true wealth. And guess what? It wasn’t the day I bought my first\n\f\n42\nthe millionaire fastlane Lamborghini. It wasn’t the day I moved into a big house on a mountain or sold my \ncompany for millions. Wealth is not authored by material possessions, money, or \n“stuff,” but by what I call the three fundamental “F’s”: family (relationships), fitness \n(health), and freedom (choice). Within this wealth trinity is where you will find \ntrue wealth and, yes, happiness.\nWealth is strong-spirited familial relationships with people. Not just your fam-\nily, but with people, your community, your God, and your friends. At the end of \nthe iconic movie It’s A Wonderful Life we’re given the final lesson: “Remember, no \nman is a failure who has friends.” This reflects on the importance of having your \nlife shared with friends, family, and loved ones. Wealth is making a difference. \nWealth is community and impacting the lives of others. Wealth cannot be expe -\nrienced alone in a vacuum. Believe me, the richest moments of my life occurred \nwhen I was surrounded by a family of friends and loved ones. \nSecond, wealth is fitness: health, vibrancy, passion, and boundless energy. If you \ndon’t have health, you lack wealth. Ask any terminally ill person what they value. \nAsk any cancer survivor how they suddenly feel reborn and happiness is displaced \nfrom “stuff” to people and experiences. There is no price on health and vibrancy. \nAnd finally, wealth is freedom and choice: freedom to live how you want to live, \nwhat, when, and where. Freedom from bosses, alarm clocks, and the pressures of \nmoney. Freedom to passionately pursue dreams. Freedom to raise your children \nas you see fit. And freedom from the drudgery of doing things you hate. Freedom \nis the liberty to live your life as you please. \nw eaLTh c an’ T be bough T For 60 e asy Paymen Ts\nI vividly remember the day. After I sold my company in 2000, my attorney handed \nme my first installment payment, a check for $250,000.\n“Yippee, $250,000! I’m rich! I made it!” I mistakenly gleamed. And now it was \ntime to announce it the world. I immediately envisioned fast cars, designer clothes, \nspeedboats, and an entourage of bikini-clad women. I thought I was wealthy and \nI was going to flaunt it. \nUnfortunately, that fantasy was miles from the reality. Yet, I tried. I bought a \ncandy-apple red convertible Corvette. Sports car? Check. Designer clothes from \nNordstrom? Check. I researched buying a speedboat until the Internet crash inter-\nrupted my orgasmic vision. I invested my newfound wealth in tech stocks and lost \nthousands of dollars. Within months, more than half of my “wealth” evaporated, \nand after a conversation with my accountant, another third was soon to be parted \nwith, thanks to taxes. \nIronically, in my attempt to look wealthy, real wealth slid further away. With \nno job, no business, no income, and a small sum of money, I couldn’t support my \nlife forever, nor the wealthy lifestyle I envisioned for someone rich. I wasn’t rich \nat all."

    "raw_text": "43\npART 3 — pooRness: The sidewAlk RoAdmApThe iLL usion oF  w eaLTh: Looking r ich\nIn pop culture, master illusionists of wealth are called “30 K millionaires.” If you \nhaven’t heard this phrase, it characterizes someone who maintains an image of \na millionaire, yet has no net worth. These folks aren’t hard to find. They drive \nentry-level BMWs with custom chrome rims, they wear fancy designer clothes \nwith gothic cursive lettering from some faux French guy, and they congregate in \nthe VIP section of the club ordering bottle service, of course, on credit. These folks \nbroadcast like dashing debutantes with an extraordinary A-game, but behind all \nthe flash-and-cash they’re miserable magicians of the Sidewalk.\nThe problem with looking wealthy versus being wealthy is that the former is \neasy while the latter is not. Easy credit and long-term monthly financing options  \n(make no payments for one year!) are tempting conduits to help you purchase the \nillusion of wealth. Society has led you to believe that wealth can be bought at a \nmall, at a car dealership, or on an infomercial. Like my initial spending spree when \nI cashed my first check, these appearances of wealth are supposed announcements \nto the world: “I’m rich!” \nBut are you? When you finance an $80,000 Mercedes Benz over six years because \nthat’s all you could afford, that isn’t wealth, but impersonation of wealth. You’re fool-\ning yourself, and it’s a Fastlane detour. But don’t jump the bandwagon yet; this isn’t \na sermon about how you can’t spend money on pricey German sedans. Not at all. \nWealth isn’t embodied in a car but in the freedom to know that you can buy it. \nFreedom to walk into the dealership, know your price, pay cash, and drive away. \nFor a gift, I bought my brother a new Lexus. It was the easiest transaction I ever did. \nI researched the car and determined the price I wanted to pay. I walked into the \ndealership with a cashier’s check and told the salesman, “I have a cashier’s check \nfor $44,000 and I want to buy that car. I need a YES  or a NO.” Twenty minutes later, \nI owned a Lexus. This is wealth, not an impersonation of wealth.\nWhen I drive to the gym, I pass a dilapidated apartment complex near the \nexpressway. In the parking lot I always see the same car parked: a shiny black \nCadillac Escalade with 22-inch chrome custom rims. Do you see the incongruity? \nYou live in a crappy apartment but you drive a $60,000 car with $10,000 rims? \nDo I see monitors in those headrests and hear a 24-speaker stereo? Geez, 90 grand \nof image and two bucks of common sense. Wouldn’t it be wiser if you focused \non owning a nice house in a nice neighborhood instead of leasing the tightest car \nin the Marbella Gardens apartment complex? Priorities:  Some want to look  rich, \nwhile others want to be rich. \nFau X w eaLTh d esTroys r eaL w eaLTh\n“Faux wealth” is the illusion of wealth without having it. It believes society’s defini-\ntion of wealth. It’s not realizing that the pursuit of “faux wealth” does something \nterribly destructive: It destroys real wealth.\n\f\nAnd as the chasm between real wealth and faux wealth expands, expectations \nare violated and misery creeps in. Like a Chinese finger-cuff, the more you try to \nlook rich, the tighter the grip of poorness becomes. Wealth cannot be purchased \nat a Mercedes dealership, but the destruction of your freedom can. \nLost in wealth’s translation is freedom. People flaunt the icons of wealth, but \ndo not have freedom, and when you don’t have freedom, it assiduously gnaws at \nthe other true wealth elements, health and relationships. \nHenry Sukarano buys his dream house in the Baltimore suburbs for $1.8 \nmillion. As a pharmaceutical representative for one of the leading drug mak-\ners, Henry’s career is on the fast-track. His big home has everything he wants, \nincluding a pool, horse stables, and an impressive five-car garage. The purchase \ngives Henry a feeling of “I’ve made it!” . . . for about eight weeks. \nCorporate politics and job cuts invade Henry’s career, forcing him to work \nlonger hours. He assumes other territories once covered by recently laid-off \nworkers. Henry commutes two hours daily and is mandated to cover the \nentire Eastern seaboard. He’s either on the road, in a plane, or sleeping. The \nlong hours have disturbing clarity: Henry rarely “lives” at his dream home, \nand when he does, he spends it sleeping or recharging from the hustle of the \nworkweek. His relationship with his wife and kids suffers. His health declines \nas the stress of responsibility mount.\nHenry comes to a moment of truth: “I’m not living a dream, but my dream \nis living me.” Feeling trapped to the lifestyle illusion, Henry continues to work \nbelieving the ideology that wealth has its price. \nNotice how the destruction of freedom attacks the other sibling wealth com -\nponents. Unaffordable material possessions have consequences to our health and \nrelationships. The irony of looking wealthy is that it is an enemy to real wealth: It \ndestroys freedom, it destroys health, and it destroys relationships.\nForemost, The Millionaire Fastlane addresses the FREEDOM portion of the \nwealth trinity, because freedom offers protection to health and relationships. Only \nyou can define your freedom and how you prefer to live. If you want the freedom \nto fly private jets, that’s it. If you want the freedom to live a minimalist lifestyle, \nthen that is it. Everyone’s freedom is different! Within your personal definition, \nyou’ll find a big piece of your wealth puzzle, as opposed to society’s version, which \nleads to Sidewalking purgatory.\nc ha PTer s ummary: Fas TLane d is Tinc Tions\n • Wealth is authored by strong familial relationships, fitness and health, and \nfreedom—not by material possessions. \n • Unaffordable material possessions are destructive to the wealth trinity."

Does the guy who owns a \nFerrari automatically have a small penis while the guy behind the wheel of a Honda \nmust be well hung?\nGo to Google and search the phrase “Money doesn’t buy happiness.” Page after \npage concludes that money has no bearing on happiness. Should you be shocked \nthat a Connecticut businessman earning a six-figure salary might be unhappier \nthan a cattle-herder in Kenya? Absolutely not. \nThat fact is, these analyses fall short because they don’t isolate the real thief \nof happiness: servitude , the antithesis of freedom. The irony is that when most \npeople earn “more money,” it doesn’t add freedom, it detracts. By creating Lifestyle \nServitude, more money becomes destructive to the wealth trinity: family, fitness, \nand freedom.\nAccording to Creighton University’s Center for Marriage and Family, debt is \nthe leading cause of strife for the newly married. Debt and Lifestyle Servitude \nkeeps people bound to work and unbound to relationships. A 2003 World Value \nSurvey (worldvaluessurvey.com) found that the happiest people in the world\n\f\n46\nthe millionaire fastlane have a tight sense of community and strong family bonds. After basic needs are \nmet (security, shelter, health, food), our happiness quotient is most significantly \nimpacted by the quality of our relationships with our partners, our family, our \nfriends, our spirituality, and ourselves. If we are too busy chasing the next great -\nest gadget to strike down the competitive opulence of the Joneses, we finance our \nmisery. The World Value Survey concluded that “consumerism” is the leading \nobstacle to happiness.\nThe fact is, there are many millionaires and well paid career folks who are \nabsolutely miserable, and it has nothing to do with the money. It has to do with \ntheir freedom. Money owns them, instead of them owning their money. The well-\nsalaried workaholic who is never home to strengthen the relationship with his wife \nand kids is likely to be less happier than the poor farmer in Thailand who spends \nhalf his day tending to his fields and the other half with his family. \nIn 2009, the popular American talk show host David Letterman went pub -\nlic with an extortion plot by a producer from another CBS show. The men who \nperpetrated the alleged $2 million blackmail scam reportedly earned $214,000 \na year. Yet the man claimed to be in severe financial ruin, partly due to spousal \nalimony payments of nearly $6,000 per month. Was this extortionist trying to \nblackmail a celebrity because he wanted to “buy happiness?” What was his real \nmotive? I contend that he was trying to buy freedom because his debts kept him \ncontained in servitude. Would $2 million have made a difference? Perhaps in the \nshort term, but not in the long term because his relationship with money was \nalready corrupted. A source close to the investigation said, “He just didn’t want \nto work anymore.” In other words, he craved freedom.\nn orma Lcy i s T he r aT r ace, a m odern- day sL aVery\nWhy am I wealthy, versus the guy stuck in morning traffic driving to work? \nI have freedom. I wake up and do what I want. I pursue dreams. I write this book \nwithout worrying about how many will sell. I hop a plane to Las Vegas for two \nweeks without worrying about jobs, bosses, or unpaid electric bills. Freedom is \nfantastic.\nYet my lifestyle is not “normal.” Like wealth, society, through its “Get Rich \nSlow” mandates, has defined “normal” for you. Normal is waking at 6 a.m., \nfighting traffic, and working eight hours. Normal is to slave at a job Monday \nthrough Friday, save 10%, and repeat for 50 years. Normal is to buy everything \non credit. Normal is to believe the illusion that the stock market will make you \nrich. Normal is to believe that a faster car and a bigger house will make you \nhappy. You’re conditioned to accept normal based on society’s already corrupted \ndefinition of wealth, and because of it, normal itself is corrupted. Normal is \nmodern-day slavery .\n\f\n47\npART 3 — pooRness: The sidewAlk RoAdmApI’m amazed that most people perilously operate one crisis away from financial \nruin. We have become a nation of undisciplined spenders and consumers. We have \nbecome a nation where unfettered spending and material extravagance write our \nobituaries in the ink of stress. If you’re held hostage to your lifestyle, you aren’t \nwealthy, because you lack freedom.\nThe ProP er u se oF  money\nMoney doesn’t buy happiness when it’s misused. Instead of money buying freedom, \nit buys bondage. “Wealth” and “happiness” are interchangeable, but only if your \ndefinition of wealth hasn’t been corrupted by society’s definition. Society says wealth \nis “stuff,” and because of this faulty definition, the bridge between wealth and hap-\npiness collapses. When you don’t feel wealthy, you’re likely to try to conjure that \nfeeling. You buy icons of wealth to feel wealthy. You crave feelings, respect, pride, \nand joy. You want admiration, love, and acceptance. And what are these feelings \nsupposed to do for you? You expect deliverance into happiness.\nAnd that’s the bait. We equate the corrupted definition of wealth with hap -\npiness, and when it doesn’t deliver, expectations are violated and unhappiness is \nthe consequence.\nUsed properly, money buys freedom, and freedom is one parcel in the wealth \ntrinity. Freedom buys choices. The fact is, there are plenty of poor people who live \nricher than their overworked upper-middle-class counterparts because the latter \nlack freedom, they lack solid relationships, and they lack health—all deleterious \neffects of working a hated job five days a week for 50 years.\nMoney secures one agent of the wealth formula, freedom, which is a powerful \nguardian to wealth’s sibling ingredients: health and relationships. \n1) Money buys the freedom to watch your kids grow up.\n2) Money buys the freedom to pursue your craziest dreams.\n3) Money buys the freedom to make a difference in the world.\n4) Money buys the freedom to build and strengthen relationships.\n5)  Money buys the freedom to do what you love, with financial validation removed \nfrom the equation.\nAre any of the above likely to make you happy? I bet they will. They certainly \nwon’t make you unhappy. \nLiFesTyLe s er ViTude: The Tra P o F The s idewa Lk\nSidewalkers are embroiled in Lifestyle Servitude, where life is forced into a rat race, \na constant tug-of-war between lifestyle extravagances and work, a self-perpetuating \nmerry-go-round of work for income, income for lifestyle, and lifestyle for work. \nWherever there’s Lifestyle Servitude, there’s a systematic erosion of freedom."

After college graduation, \nI took a hellacious job as a construction laborer in Chicago and fought city traffic \ndaily. The pay was more than I had ever earned at my young age, and with my increase \nin income, I felt wealthy. So what did I do? I elevated my lifestyle and financed the \nillusion of wealth. I bought my first sports car, a Mitsubishi 3000 GT. \nIt didn’t take long for me to realize that my dream car wasn’t an icon of wealth, \nbut a parasite that fed on my freedom. I hated my job, it was stressful, and it drained \nmy energy, leaving my entrepreneurial dreams tethered. I couldn’t quit. I had \nresponsibilities: car payments, gas, and insurance. Because of my obligations to \n“stuff,” I had sentenced myself to imprisonment in a job I loathed. \nYet, this type of servitude is normal. We’re taught to strive for the latest and \ngreatest regardless of consequence.

If you have to think about \n“affordability,” you can’t afford it because affordability carries conditions and con-\nsequences. If you buy a boat and resort to mental gymnastics over affordability, \nYOU CAN’T AFFORD IT. Sure you can assuage affordability and make outlandish \narguments, often starting with “I can afford this as long as . . .\n. . .

If you pay cash and your lifestyle \ndoesn’t change regardless of future circumstances, you can afford it. In other \nwords, if you buy a boat, pay cash, and are NOT  be affected by unexpected \n“bumps in the road,” you can afford it. Would you regret a gum purchase if you \nlost your job a week later? Or if your sales forecast was slashed by 50%? Nope, it \nwouldn’t make a difference. This is how affordability is measured against your \nlevel of wealth.\nTo overcome wealth impersonation, know what you can and can’t afford. There \nis nothing wrong with buying boats and Lamborghinis if you can truly afford \nthem. There is a time and a place to indulge. The Millionaire Fastlane is designed \nto bring you to that place. \nThe b ai T o F Li FesTyLe s er ViTude \nThe siren call of Lifestyle Servitude is the false prophet of feel-good—instant \ngratification and immediate pleasure. Wouldn’t it be nice if everything that felt \ngood were good? Chocolate? That super-sized fast-food combo meal? Sunbathing? \nSmoking? Unfortunately, short-term feel-good is often long-term bad. Instant \ngratification is a populous plague and its predominant side effects are easily spot -\nted: debt and obesity. \nMost Americans are fat because the easiest (and cheapest) instant gratification \ncomes from food. When you plop your butt on the recliner and maul through a \ncan of Pringles, you choose pleasure now in lieu of pain later. If you live with your \nparents and you finance $45,000 over 72 months for a new Mustang based on a \n$31,000-a-year bartender’s wage, you let instant gratification win, and Lifestyle \nServitude ensues. \nWealth, like health, isn’t easy and is cut from the same fabric. Their processes \nare identical. They require discipline, sacrifice, persistence, commitment, and \nyes, delayed gratification. If you can’t immunize yourself from the temptations \nof instant gratification, you’ll be hard pressed to find success in either health or \nwealth. Both demand a lifestyle shift from short-term thinking (instant gratifi -\ncation) to long-term thinking (delayed gratification). This is the only defense to \nLifestyle Servitude. \nLook F or T he hook!\nInstant gratification is the bait and Lifestyle Servitude is the hook.  The advertising \nindustry is on a great fishing expedition, and their goal is to hook you. Their juicy \nbait? That shiny new car, the bigger house, the designer clothes, the “got-to-have-it-\nnow” product. Every day you are bombarded with instant gratification’s bait . . .\n“You can’t survive life without this product!” \n“Buy now and life will be so much easier!”\n\f\n“You are not a success until you own one of these!” \n“Imagine how envious the neighbors will be when you buy this!” \nThese messages share one commonality: You’re their prey and the peddlers \ndon’t care if you can afford it or not. Defend yourself by exposing the hook beneath \nthe bait: the bucket of bondage which is Lifestyle Servitude. When instant grati -\nfication entices you to bite the bait, you become a casualty of the hook: Lifestyle \nServitude. Instead of you owning your stuff, your stuff owns you.

I’m not lucky; I’m a player of the game . While Mr. Lucky-\nBastard-Hater uttered that under his breath and sat his ass in the dugout, I was \nat the plate taking swings.\nJoe is a Sidewalker and believes luck is required to get rich. He spends his days \nworking construction and his evenings commenting on gossip blogs, playing video \ngames, and watching TV. He has given up on his dreams of financial independence \nbased on his ideas of luck. “I’m just not a lucky guy,” he laments. Joe’s brother Bill \nalso has a job in construction, except Bill spends his evenings surfing the Internet, \nresearching the newest practices of inventing and engineering. Bill’s dream is to \nbe an inventor and has created four prototypes of inventions in various fields. \nBill also spends his vacation time at trade shows and marketing seminars. While \nJoe is killing ogres and wizards in the latest dungeon of doom, Bill is out of the \nbox of nothingness and exposing himself and his inventions to the world. Who’s \ngoing to “get lucky”?\nseLF-made m iLLions arise F rom se LF-made Luck\nMark Cuban, billionaire entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks NBA  \nteam (http://www.blogmaverick) told a telling tale of luck in regards to his success. \nMark recalls the struggles of his early successes before his big sale to Yahoo for\n\f\n52\nthe millionaire fastlane $5.9 billion. In each story, Mark remembers how people attributed his success to \nluck . . . lucky to sell his first company, MicroSolutions . . . lucky to make money \ntrading in the technology boom . . . and lucky to sell his company to Yahoo for \na few billion. Notice how events are quickly reasoned to be luck and process is \nswept underneath the rug. \nCuban understands the dichotomy that most don’t: Process creates events that \nothers see as luck. He goes on to comment how nobody mentioned luck when it came \ntime to reading complicated software texts or Cisco router manuals or sitting in his \nhouse testing and experimenting with new technologies. Where was luck then?\n“Rich people got lucky” is a Sidewalker’s creed and a disempowering belief \nthat strips you of your free will. While luck can create riches by way of lotteries, \ncasinos, and rich parents, it rarely creates long-lasting wealth. To take advantage \nof The Millionaire Fastlane understand that luck is a product of process , action, \nwork, and being “out there.” And when you are “out there” you stand a chance at \nbeing in the right place at the right time. \nThere are right places and wrong places. The right place isn’t on your sofa watch-\ning American Idol  or slapping greenbacks into thongs at Betty’s Booty Cabaret, \nor down at the neighborhood bar getting jacked-up on Bud Light while watching \nthe Cubs lose another game. If you want to be at the right place at the right time \nyou indeed have to be at the right place—and the right place knows which places \nare the wrong places. \nIf you aren’t off the Sidewalk taking action and engaging in process, you will \nnever realize luck. Luck is always perceived to be a matter of event: you win the \nlottery, you win a sweepstakes, or you find a 200-year-old painting in the attic \nworth millions. Again, more falsities. Like wealth, luck is not an event but an \naftereffect of process. Luck is the residue of process . \nSidewalkers love events but hate process. It’s only natural for Sidewalkers to \nassume wealth is luck, because they believe wealth is an event. A member of the \nFastlane Forum (TheFastlaneForum.com) recently posted that Bill Gates got lucky. \nI had to disagree. Luck didn’t create Windows. Luck didn’t create a company. Luck \ndidn’t create repetitive, concerted action toward a specified purpose. When you \nconsistently act and bombard the world with your efforts, interacting with the \nwaves of others, stuff happens. And that stuff? Sidewalkers interpret it as luck, \nwhen it is nothing more than action engaged with better probabilities. \nLuck occurs when probability moves from impossible to likely. For our two \nbrothers in construction, who is going to get lucky? The brother who exposes his \ninventions to the world bends probability in his favor. His lazy brother does not. \nForce your process out into the world and you can defy the odds of “being in the \nright place at the right time.”\nWhen I think of luck, I think about poker players. Mistakenly, their craft is \nconstrued as luck, while career poker players will affirm it isn’t luck, but systematic \nanalytics and player psychology. The best poker players in the world are superior\n\f\n53\npART 3 — pooRness: The sidewAlk RoAdmApstatisticians and interpreters of human behavior. Does luck play a role? Sure, but \nthe role is minor, while player competency siphons the majority’s bankroll. To tell \na great poker player “you’re lucky” is to hurl an insult. Likewise, to ascribe luck to \na self-made millionaire’s success is to perform the same insult. \nTo realize luck, engage in processes where better probabilities exist. Luck is intro-\nduced when you play. When life is played to win, luck shows its face. Unfortunately, \nSidewalkers assign luck to events of faith—luck not engaged by process. If you want \nluck, engage in process, because process raises events from the ashes. \nr enounce T he “ big h iT” as y our Financia L PLan \nSidewalkers loathe process, so their financial plan omits standard process (such \nas saving or budgeting) and relies on events. If you believe that luck is the sole \nsource of wealth, you’ll gravitate toward events of luck—a diligent quest to find -\ning “the big hit.” \nWhat’s a big hit? Big hits are sudden miracles that create wealth fast. Lotteries, \ncasinos, poker tournaments, heck, even frivolous lawsuits and defrauding the gov-\nernment are considered avenues to “the big hit.” In effect, “big hits” are attempts \nto bypass the wealth journey and start at the finish line. It’s the removal of your \nyellow brick road and the sharpening lessons that come from it. \nSidewalkers seek “big hits” because their belief systems tell them wealth is an \nevent. Unfortunately, big hits are long shots and violations of true essence. Do you \nbelieve in miracles? Sidewalkers do.\nWhy do reality TV competitions such as American Idol attract so many people \nwhen most of the contestants suck? These people are searching for that elusive \n“big hit.” While the talented make it through (they have talent because they have \nprocess), the disqualified bemoan off the set, blaming Simon Cowell, the micro -\nphone, or some other insignificant factor for their failures.

And when that \nhappens, you’re vulnerable to joining the ranks of victims. \nThe road to victimhood is through denial: First responsibility, then account -\nability.

Kennedy’s “Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can \ndo for your country” has maligned into “What can my country do for me?” While \nI can’t comment on the societal deterioration outside of the United States, within \nthe last 20 years Sidewalking has become a way of life in America. Americans \nonce loyally proclaimed, “Give me liberty or give me death.” Now we just say, \n“Give me.”\nAs I write, the economy is in a tailspin. The housing market crashed, lending \ndried up, and millions have lost their savings. How did we get here? It isn’t com -\nplicated: We relied on “others” to make financial decisions for us. We ignored the \nfine print. We didn’t read the contract. We didn’t read the legislation. We made \ngovernment an insurance policy. As a society, history is doomed to repeat if we \ncontinue to repeat the same behavior.\nI’m a minor participant in the recession. Sure, my home declined in value but \nthat’s OK because I don’t use my home as a wealth tool! Yet the gurus say “your \nhome is your greatest investment!” Baloney! When the markets crashed, I didn’t \nlose a lot of money because the markets weren’t my wealth acceleration vehicle! \nThe Fastlane is about control, and if you live like a Sidewalking hitchhiker, you \nhave no control. \nOn a public forum in August 2005, I predicted the forthcoming housing bust \nand outlined my theory with seven reasons I thought so. As it turns out, I was \ncorrect, and that truth crystallized because I chose to make financial decisions for \nmyself. I didn’t rely on the pontificators at CNBC who rapaciously declared that \nhousing was safe. I didn’t rely on the mainstream media. I didn’t rely on others. \nI relied on me. I was driving, not hitchhiking. And the beauty of driving is some -\nthing that escapes most people: responsibility.\n\f\n58\nthe millionaire fastlane w eaLTh d emands r esPonsibi LiTy, Fo LLowed by a ccoun Tabi LiTy\nResponsibility is the forefather to accountability, but one doesn’t evidence the \nother. When you admit responsibility to overdrafting your checking account yet \ndo it again next week, you’re not accountable. When you admit responsibility to \nfathering a child out of wedlock, yet continue to engage in that behavior, you’re \nnot accountable. When you take responsibility for having your purse stolen but \nflaunt it on the table in open view, you’re not accountable.\nAccountability is being culpable to your consequences and modifying your \nbehavior if need be to prevent those consequences. You can be responsible while \nnot being accountable. A Fastlane Forum user does a great job distinguishing \nbetween responsibility and accountability:\n“What kills me is when people make the same piss-poor choice multiple \ntimes but then claim to be responsible. It’s easy to be “responsible” when \nresponsible means just walking away. I’ve seen single parents who pledge to be \n“responsible” for the wild oats they’ve sown, only to occasionally send a check \nin the mail. I’ve seen people walk away from homes, claiming to be “respon-\nsible” for their actions, only to buy another home they can’t afford. I’ve seen \npeople being “responsible” for the actions their drinking and driving caused \nonly to do it again! I am sick and tired of people being “responsible!” I want \npeople to be accountable. People need to think before they act. Own their \nchoices before they make them. I am okay with people making mistakes—but \nfreaking own that you made a mistake and learn from it. That’s what true \naccountability and responsibility is all about.”\nA friend of mine recently had her identity stolen. As we dined at a restaurant \nshe bellyached about the nightmarish ordeal. Determined to find the cause of her \nproblem, I stopped her contempt midstream and asked a few questions. I wondered, \nwas she a victim, or not being accountable? \nI asked, “How did your identity get stolen?” \n“My purse was stolen in Mexico.” \n“How did that happen?” I probed. \n“I was at a restaurant and someone swiped it” \n“Oh? Was your purse laid out, wide-open on the table, like it is now?” \nShe glanced at her purse and got my point. As we dined, her purse sat on \nthe tabletop in open view of everyone. Any thief could easily snatch her purse \nand run. She looked at me, scoffed, and then grabbed her purse and secured it \nto her lap. \nA victim? Or not holding herself accountable? Her problem was caused by a bad \nchoice—the choice to not safeguard her purse. And even after this costly lesson, \nshe still didn’t understand the power of being accountable. If she were accountable"

While the Sidewalk is a chronic lifestyle that mortgages the future for a \npleasurable today, the Slowlane is the antithesis: a sacrifice of today in the hopes \nof a brighter and freer tomorrow. \nAs a Slowlane traveler, you’re deluged with a series of doctrines that plead dis-\ncipline to the trade-off. Get a job and waste five days a week toiling at the office. \nBag a lunch and stop drinking $10 coffee. Faithfully entrust 10% of your paycheck \nto the stock market and your 401 K. Quit dreaming about that sports car in the \nwindow because you can’t buy it! Delay gratification until you’re 65 years old. Save, \nsave, save because compound interest is powerful: $10,000 invested today will be \nwith 10 gazillion in 50 years! \nSurprisingly, the Slowlane is the first convenient exit off the Sidewalk and evolves \nwith maturity and increased adult responsibilities. Most college graduates begin \ntheir post-schooling life on the Sidewalk. I certainly did. Graduation pardoned a \nlicense to buy stuff that yielded instant pleasure: trips to Cancun, a flashy car with\n\f\n64\nthe millionaire fastlane a booming stereo, nightly drinking binges, a massive CD  collection. Life was all \nabout now, regardless of future consequences. Sidewalkers (and people in general) \ninstinctively regard a better future: “I’ll be making more money,” “I’ll hit the lot-\ntery,” “After my father dies I’ll inherit thousands.” Future crutches often justify \npleasurable nows and, behind the scenes, Lifestyle Servitude swells.\nHowever, with increased responsibilities, perhaps a growing family, mounting \ndebt loads, and future expectations not matching reality, the Sidewalker comes to \nterms with the uncertainty of the Sidewalk and does the seemingly responsible lane \nchange: He off-ramps and graduates to the Slowlane roadmap, a strategy touted \nand praised by credible sources. While the Sidewalk is typified by undisciplined \nbehavior, the Slowlane’s financial plan introduces responsibility and accountability \ninto the wealth formula. That can’t be bad right?\nUnfortunately, the Slowlane is like bad directions given at a gas station, except \nthese directions aren’t given by strangers, but by people you trust: teachers, televi-\nsion and radio personalities, financial advisers, and yes, even our parents. These \nostensible sources reinforce the strategy’s fictitious strength when its efficacy is \na sucker’s bet. The Slowlane is a lifetime wager that a sacrificial today will yield a \nwealthier tomorrow. \nThe Promise o F w eaLTh . . . The Price? y our Li Fe\nThe Slowlane is rarely challenged. It’s a lie so deceiving that when the ruse is \nuncovered, decades of life have passed . . . meanwhile, millions more are being \nnewly indoctrinated to the deception.\nIf you buy the lie, you sell off today in hopes of a glorious tomorrow. And \nwhen does this glorious tomorrow happen? When can you splurge, spend your \nmillions, and enjoy life? When? The driving force behind wealth under Get \nRich Slow is time —time employed at the job and time invested in the markets. \nYour glorious tomorrow might arrive after 40 years, when you’re living your last \npresidential administration and on your second hip replacement. Your glorious \ntomorrow might arrive when you’re 73 years old and soaked in urine and strapped \nto a stinking bed because you’ve lost your mind to Alzheimer’s. Seriously, when \ndoes this Slowlane plan of retiring rich actually become real so you can enjoy \nyour millions?\nAs a teenager, Joe reads several personal finance books about getting rich. \nThey tell him to save, get a career, clip coupons, and live below your means. \nAfter graduating with a law degree, Joe follows this advice. While it is dif -\nficult, Joe follows this plan for wealth diligently. He works 60 hours weekly \nat his law firm, often neglecting his family and children. His weekdays are \nconsumed at the office, while his weekends are spent home “recharging” from \nthe rigors of the workweek."

Unfortunately, \nmillions of people have faithfully invested decades into the plan only to discover \nthe ugly truth: The Slowlane is risky and insufferably impotent.\nA strategy that requires your life and your dreams to be paid as penance is a \nsucker’s bet.

Unfortunately, wheelchairs don’t fit in the \ntrunks of Lamborghinis.\nsL ow Lane m ind Pos Ts and m issiV es\nOver time, the Slowlaner collects and espouses a series of mindposts reinforced \nby credible sources.

While coupons and other Slowlane strategies \naren’t worthless in a plan, they shouldn’t be the plan. The Slowlane as a total plan \nis the problem, not the Slowlane being a part of a plan. This distinction is critical \nbecause financial discipline must transcend to any wealth campaign.\nThe sL ow Lane r oadmaP : a  maThema TicaL  in Troduc Tion\nHow is wealth created in the Slowlane? To expose its method (and its weakness) \nyou need to reverse engineer and deconstruct the strategy down to its mathemati-\ncal roots, or its wealth equation. In other words, you want to expose the plan’s \ntheoretical speed limits for wealth, which is always determined by two variables: \nyour primary income source (a job) and your wealth acceleration vehicle (market \ninvestments). These two variables formulate the Slowlane’s wealth equation and \ngoverns its wealth creation power or, in this case, futility.\nWealth = (Primary Income Source: Job) + (Wealth Accelerator: Market Investments) \nThis equation factored looks like this:\nWealth = Intrinsic Value + Compound Interest\nThe primary income variable, intrinsic value has two variables itself dependent \non how you are paid within your job. It could be either:\n • Go to school\n • Get good grades\n • Graduate\n • Pay yourself first\n • Overtime\n • Corporate ladder\n • Save X% of your paycheck\n • Contribute to your 401 K\n • Invest in mutual funds\n • Buy and hold\n • Paychecks, pensions, benefits\n • Diversify\n • Raise your insurance deductibles\n • The stock market\n • Say “no” to expensive lattes\n • Be frugal\n • Get out of debt\n • Clip coupons\n • Cancel your credit cards\n • Dollar cost averaging\n • Get an advanced degree\n • Pay off your house early\n • Your home is an asset\n • Individual retirement accounts (IRAs)\n • Live below your means\n • Understand compound interest\nSlowlane Weapons\n\f\n68\nthe millionaire fastlane Intrinsic Value = Hourly Wage × Hours Worked\n~ or ~\nIntrinsic Value = Yearly Salary \nCompound interest is derived from “market investments,” which is the univer-\nsal concept that $ X invested in the stock market today will be worth $ X millions \ndecades from now. In chapter 12, we will examine the Slowlane’s mathematical \nconstructs and exploit their true deficiency. Therein, you’ll discover why society’s \nplan, your parent’s plan, the media’s plan, and the guru’s plan are horrific strate-\ngies for wealth. \nh aVe you s o Ld y our s ou L For a w eekend?\nYour soul is worth more than a weekend. Banality followed by blindness is the \nside effect of Slowlane institutionalization.\nIn 2007 on a cold January morning, a violinist stationed himself in a Washington, \nDC, train station and played six classical pieces from Bach. Except this was no \nordinary violinist and it was no ordinary violin. This was an incognito Joshua \nBell, one of the greatest musicians in the world, who nights earlier had played to \na sold-out concert hall in Boston for nearly $100 a ticket. As Joshua played his $3.5 \nmillion violin in the midst of the morning commuter rush, approximately 2,000 \npeople passed through the station, most of them on their way to work.\nHe played continuously for 45 minutes. Only six people stopped to listen briefly. \nNo crowd formed. About 20 folks gave money but continued onward at a brisk \npace. When he finished, there was silence except for the rhythmic hustle of a busy \ntrain station. No applause. No crowd. No recognition. \nThis experiment, conducted by the Washington Post , uncovers something \nincredibly powerful—and disturbing. Not even the greatest musician in the world \ncan illuminate the blinding depths of the rat race and those entrenched by its \nindifference. Have you become so numbed by making a living that the living has \nbeen sucked out of your life? Are you so blinded by Monday through Friday that \nany beauty that sings before you is muted? The train commuters come and go like \nzombies—they’re oblivious to the splendor of Monday through Friday. Yet, what \nif this experiment occurred on Saturday; would its outcome be any different?\nThis story exposes the Slowlane for its contempt: When you trade your life \nmindlessly for a paycheck, you risk being blinded to life itself as you cursively walk \nby it in a busy train station. Life does not begin on Friday night and end Monday \nmorning."

It’s Saturday night!” he wailed. I told him something a Slowlaner \ndoesn’t understand: For me, every day is a Saturday because I haven’t sold off  \nMonday through Friday.\nWealth’s provenance evolves from the three Fs: family, fitness, and freedom. \nFreedom’s value to wealth is evidenced on Friday evenings, which just so hap -\npened to be the setting for an epic conversation I had with my friend at a happy \nhour. While we sat on the bar’s patio, we heard a chattering cacophony of patrons \nengaged in spirited conversation. The bar was “happening” and within the rustling \nsoundtrack, you’d never guess a recession was ongoing.\nOver the noise, I asked my friend “What do you hear?”\n“I hear people having a great time, a celebration,” she said.\nI asked further, “Why?”\n“Why what? It’s Friday!” she declared.\nI probed further. “What’s so special about Friday? If we came here on Monday, \nthis place would be empty and the sound of celebration would be absent. What \nmakes Friday so special as opposed to Monday or Wednesday?”\nKnowing that she was trapped into one of my paradoxical interrogations, she \nhumored me. \n“Uhh . . . people get paid on Friday?”\nI levied the verdict: Friday evening is glorified because people celebrate the \ndividends of their trade: five days of work-bondage exchanged for two days of \nunadulterated freedom. Saturday and Sunday is the payment for Monday through \nFriday, and Friday evening symbolizes the emergence of that payment, freedom \nfor two days. The prostitution of Monday through Friday is the reason “Thank \nGod it’s Friday” exists. On Friday, people are paid FREEDOM in the currency of \nSaturday and Sunday!\nn ega TiVe 60%: The d isma L r eTurn o F The sL ow Lane\nThe ultimate insanity is to sell your soul Monday through Friday for the paycheck \nof Saturday and Sunday. Yes, give me $5 today and in return I’ll give you $2 back \ntomorrow. 5-for-2. No? How about five loaves of bread today and in return, I’ll \ngive you two back tomorrow. No again? Why? This is a smoking deal!\nHopefully you recognize that five of anything in exchange for two is a bad \nreturn. The 5-for-2 return on investment is a negative 60%. If you make consis -\ntent negative 60% return on investments, you’d go bankrupt quick. What logical \nperson would accept such a horrific deal? \nMost likely, you already do. When you accept the Slowlane roadmap as your \nstrategy, you accept 5-for-2. You give five days of work servitude in exchange for \ntwo days of weekend freedom. Yes, Monday through Friday is prostituted for\n\f\n70\nthe millionaire fastlane Saturday and Sunday. While people easily recognize and reject a negative 60% \nreturn on their money, they do it willingly with their time.\nIf you have children you have to question this normality. Kids grow on Mondays \nand Tuesdays. I’ve heard they grow on Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays too. \nYes, they don’t wait for the weekend to grow up. When little Miranda speaks her \nfirst word, walks her first walk, dances the first dance, she doesn’t care if you’re in \nHouston for the quarterly manager’s meeting. Kids and relationships don’t wait \nfor the weekend to grow, and while you’re out trading 5-for-2, guess what—the \nkids get older and so do you.\nPeople who are bankrupt with time see their freedom, their families and their \nrelationships disintegrate. Time is mismanaged because the Slowlane is predicated \non time. Five days of servitude for two days of freedom is not a good trade unless \nyou trade time into a system that can give you a better return on your time. Instead \nof 5-for-2 for life, how about a 5-for-2 trade that has the potential to blossom into \na better ratio? Like 1-for-2 or 3-for-10? Would you make a 5-for-2 trade knowing \nthat it could transform into a 1-for-10? Would that be a something to invest in?\nWhile I worked my plan, I gave 7-for-0 (I worked seven days and didn’t take \na day off) because I knew the roads on my roadmap converged with dreams. \nI worked for a better ratio in the near future, not in 40 years. I controlled my \ndestiny and eventually my time trade investment yielded a dividend of 40 years. \nNow I do 0-for-7. I work zero days and get seven days of freedom. Sadly, if you are \nentrenched in the Slowlane, your options to shatter this negative 60% return for \nyour freedom is restricted. Remember, wealth is defined by freedom, and if you \nrequire proof, look no further than Friday night when people celebrate freedom \nas the Slowlane dictatorship takes a weekend furlough.\nnorma L is c ondemna Tion T o m ediocri Ty\nRevolutionary Road, the 2008 movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, \ndoes an excellent job portraying the Slowlane’s death grip. A young couple find \nthemselves living in suburbia, going through the motions of life: The husband \n(DiCaprio) goes to work every morning and immerses himself in a crowd of his \npeers while his wife (Winslet) fills the role of the good housewife. Both instinctively \nknow that something is wrong. They’re settling. They’ve accepted normal. They’ve \nforsaken their dreams for the insane plan of everyone. Throughout the movie we \nwitness their attempts to escape, and with perilous consequences. \nThe problem is, we’ve been brainwashed to accept the Slowlane roadmap as \nnormal. The defective roadmap gains traction early in life and is sanctified as the \n“commoners” only probable means to wealth. Sounds logical right? Folks like us \njust don’t get rich playing pro ball, rapping, singing, acting, or entertaining, so \nwe’re left with the Slowlane. And for some, that just might be OK. But for the rest \nof us with big dreams, big goals, and big ideas, it just doesn’t cut the mustard.\n\f\n71\npART 4 — mediocRiTy: The slowlAne RoAdmApHere’s a Slowlane story pulled from the pages of the Fastlane Forum \n(TheFastlaneForum.com):\nIn the quest for becoming wealthy, my life has become quite uncomfortable. \nIt all started five years ago when I had nothing. I had turned 30 years old and \nI thought that living paycheck to paycheck was no way to live at all. I made \na vow to myself that I would become wealthy. In order to do this I took on a \nsecond job and saved all of the money from that job while I used the money \nfrom the first job to pay for my living expenses. Basically, the last five years \nof my life have been as such in order for me to save money:\n– living and paying relatively cheap rent for an 8×13 foot room\n– using public transportation and a motorcycle for transportation. \n– working almost every day with no days off during the week\n– rarely eating out\n– never buying “toys” or nice things for myself or wife\n– almost never going out and having a good time\nWith the second job and my economical lifestyle I have managed to save \nabout $50,000 in five years. It would have been more, but I lost a good $30,000 \nwhen I invested right before the Dow hit its peak in October of 2007. \nI’ve reached a breaking point. Five years is a long time to live in a room \nno bigger than a jail cell. The jobs are mind numbing. I feel like my life is \na prison. I have a good lifestyle for saving money, but at the expense of my \nmental sanity and happiness as a human being. I just feel like I can’t live \nlike this any longer. \nThe Slowlaner accepts an existence of frugality and sacrifice to a tipping-point \nwhere life feels like incarceration. Does this guy’s life seem awesome or mediocre? \nWill it merge with a dream? The Slowlane plan forsakes the now for a faint promise \nof a wealthy future. I don’t consider “settle for less” a strategy, which is why the \nSlowlane is predisposed to mediocrity. Life isn’t great, but it isn’t so bad either. No, \nit could be better . . . but you’ve got to swap the Slowlane for a new plan. \nc ha PTer s ummary: Fas TLane d is Tinc Tions\n • The Slowlane is a natural course-correction from the Sidewalk evolving from \ntaking responsibility and accountability.\n • Wealth is best experienced when you’re young, vibrant, and able, not in the \ntwilight of your life.\n • The Slowlane is a plan that takes decades to succeed, often requiring masterful \npolitical prowess in a corporate environment.\n\f\n• For the Slowlaner, Saturday and Sunday is the paycheck for Monday through \nFriday.\n • The default return on your time in the Slowlane is negative 60%—5-for-2.\n • The 5-for-2 trade inherit in the Slowlane is generally fixed and cannot be \nmanipulated, because job standards are five days a week.\n • The predisposed destination of the Slowlane is mediocrity.

F or a Phonebook?\nBefore college graduation, I humored myself and attended a few job workshops. \nOne I remember vividly: an entry-level position at a big insurance firm in Chicago. \nDuring our introduction at the corporate facility, the company recruiters told us \nexactly what to expect:\n“Over there [pointing to a sea of cubicles] is where our new hires sit. I won’t \nbe coy; in the beginning this job is difficult. We give you three things: a desk, a \ntelephone, and a telephone book. You will spend 10 hours a day cold-calling \nto build your clientele. I know, not glamorous, but the rewards . . .”\nAt that point the rewards were inconsequential and I went into acting mode. \nI acted interested. I acted happy. I acted like it was acceptable. It wasn’t. I spent \nfive years in college just to sit in a 6 ×6 cubicle and cold-call elderly people out of a \ndamn telephone book? Are you freaking kidding me? I could have done this out of \nmiddle school, and I didn’t need to spend thousands on a college degree to hawk \ninsurance. Yet, my peers salivated at the opportunity of having a nice base salary, \na great 401 K, and a top-tier health plan. No thanks. If I’m cold-calling out of the \ndamn phonebook, it won’t be for my boss, but for me."

    "raw_text": "74\nthe millionaire fastlane Jobs: d omes Tica Tion in To norma Lcy\nIf you want to escape the Slowlane, find wealth and freedom fast, you’ve got to \ndump the job. Let me repeat. Dump the damn job! \nJobs suck. I mean that generically, not targeted toward a specific job. Whether \nyou’re an electrician or a store manager, you hold a job. Jobs suck because they’re \nrooted in limited leverage and limited control . Sure, you can have great job (and \na fun one too!) but in the scope of wealth, they limit both leverage and control—\ntwo things desperately needed if you want wealth. Here are six sucky reasons your \nfinancial plan shouldn’t revolve around a job, the nucleus to the Slowlane. \nsuckage #1: To Trade Time i s To Trade Li Fe\nWho taught us that trading time in exchange for money was a great idea? Why does \nthis normalcy consistently translate into unrivaled suckage? If you’re shackled to \na job, you’re engaged to a glorified exchange of your time (your life) for pieces of \npaper that grant you freedom. You sell your freedom to get freedom. Pretty stupid, \nhuh?\nJobs suck because they ravenously consume TIME . At a job, TIME TRADE is \ncentral to how you make money. A job is the basis for that horrific 5-for-2 exchange. \nBut let me translate that word, TIME, differently: LIFE. In a job, you sell your life \nfor money. If you work, you get paid. If you don’t work, you don’t get paid. Who \nofficiated this bloodsucking marriage? \nHere is a list of common jobs and how long you have to work just to earn $1 \nmillion. If you diligently save 10% of your earnings and stuff it under a mattress, \nyour time to $1 million multiplies by a factor of 10. Do you have 300 years to save \nyour way to $1 million?\nCareer/Job Average Annual \nSalary\nYears to EARN  \n$1 MM\nYears to SAVE  \n$1 MM\nArchitect $64,000 16 years 156 years\nAuto Mechanic $34,000 30 years 294 years\nBartender $16,000 61 years 625 years\nCarpenter $37,000 27 years 270 years\nSoftware Engineer $80,000 13 years 125 years\nSecretary $38,000 27 years 263 years\nHairdresser $22,000 47 years 454 years\nTeacher $46,000 22 years 217 years\nPharmacist $95,000 11 years 105 years\nPolice Officer $48,000 21 years 208 years\nPhysical Therapist $66,000 15 years 152 years\nVeterinarian $72,000 14 years 139 years\nSource: US Bureau of Labor Statistics, Anthony Balderrama, CareerBuilder.com. Figures rounded for simplicity.\n\f\n75\npART 4 — mediocRiTy: The slowlAne RoAdmApWouldn’t it make sense to get paid regardless of what you’re doing? Get paid \nwhile you sleep, while you have fun, while you poop, while you sit on the beach? Why \nnot get paid with the simple passage of time and make time work for you instead \nof against you? Does that exist? It does, but it doesn’t come from a Slowlane. \nsuckage #2: Limi TaTion on eXP erience \nI learned more as an entrepreneur in two months than I did working 10 years at \ndozens of dead-end jobs. The problem with a specialized skill set is, it narrows \nyour useful value to a confined set of marketplace needs. You become one of many \ncogs in a wheel. And if that cog becomes obsolete or expendable? Guess what, \nyou’re out of luck. \nFor example, thousands of autoworkers have been displaced because their \njobs have been outsourced or replaced by robotics. Experience doesn’t help them, \nit hinders them. Remember typewriters? How is the typewriter repairman doing \nthese days? How about stockbrokers? Travel agents? Dying breeds of jobs move out \nof favor like fashion fads. One year your skill set has value, the next, it doesn’t.\nSecond, job experience is usually regimented into a core group of activities that \nis routinely repeated over and over again, day after day. After the initial learning \nexperience, the job becomes regimented and accumulation of new knowledge \ncreeps to a crawl. A job limits learning and mutates into life’s death knell: a trade \nof life force for money.\nExperience comes from what you do in life, not from what you do in a job. You \ndon’t need a job to get experience. \nAsk yourself this: Which experience is more important? The experience of a \nmenial job designed to pay your bills? Or the experience (and failures) of creating \nsomething that could provide you financial freedom for a lifetime without ever \nhaving to hold a job again?\nsuckage #3: n o c on Tro L \nA job is like sitting in the bed of a pickup truck. You’re exposed to the harsh ele -\nments while the driver of the truck sits comfortably in the driver’s seat. And if \nthe ride gets rough? You get jacked around or worse, tossed overboard. There is \nno control sitting in the back of a pickup truck, and to have this “strategy” at the \nheart of your financial plan is asinine. If you don’t control your income, you don’t \ncontrol your financial plan. If you don’t control your financial plan, you don’t \ncontrol your freedom.\nMillions obediently sing the employee Kumbaya , believing that a job is cen -\ntral to supporting themselves. Sure, a job can support you, but is your goal only \n“support”? Do you want wealth or mediocrity? If the momentum of your financial \nroad trip can be road blocked by a pink slip, you’re gambling. You aren’t being real; \nyou’re being stupid. There is neither safety nor security in a job."

So-and-so is sleeping with the boss and courting favor. Jim \nis lazy but takes credit for the work. Linda has bad breath and everyone is afraid \nto tell her. Lacey arrives late and leaves early. Horace steals food and wears the \nsame sport jacket every day. Lazy Lester never replaces the copier paper. Same \nstories, different office.\nNo matter where you work, office politics play a part.

By the time \nthe “idea” gets anywhere it’s either stale or four other people have staked a claim \nto it. Who needs this entangled web destroying your sanity? The only defense to \noffice politics is to control the playing field, and to do that, you have to be the boss. \nAnd to be the boss, you not only need to run the show, you need to own it. \nsuckage #5: a s ubscri PTion To “Pay y ourse LF Las T”\n“Pay yourself first” is a Slowlane doctrine. The problem is that it’s near impossible \nin a job. Local, state, and federal governments heavily tax earned income and your \noptions to shield that income from taxation is limited to contributions to 401K s \nand IRAs—which are also limited—10% of your income or a maximum of $16,500, \nwhichever is less. If you diligently trade your life and ascend into corporate man -\nagement, expect 50% of your money to disappear before it touches your hands. As \nan employee, you immediately receive a subscription to “pay yourself last,” and yes, \nthat subscription arrives even if you don’t subscribe. If you are paying yourself last \nand everyone gets your money first, don’t expect to build wealth fast.\nsuckage #6: a d ic TaTorshi P on i ncome\nEver get hit with a 1,000% pay raise from your boss? Imagine this: Impressed at \nthe obvious returns you’ve provided at your job, you confidently stroll into your \nboss’s office and demand a raise. “I bring value to this company,” you argue. “I’m \nreliable and rarely call in sick.”\nYour boss takes a defensive posture, crosses his arms, tilts his head skyward, \nand leisurely reclines in his big, red executive chair. You take a deep breath and \nlet it ride. “Therefore, sir, I’d like a 1,000% pay raise.”\n\f\n77\npART 4 — mediocRiTy: The slowlAne RoAdmApYour boss emits a guttural groan.

As an employee, you can’t demand a pay \nraise greater than 10%, let alone 1,000%. Yet, as an employee of any company, this \nis your playing field.

    "raw_text": "78\n12\nThe Slowlane:  \nWhy You Aren't Rich \nSomebody should tell us, right at the start of our lives, that we are dying.  \nThen we might live life to the limit, every minute of every day. Do it! I say. \nWhatever you want to do, do it now. There are only so many tomorrows.\n~ Michael Landon\neXPosing sL ow Lane i ne PTiTude\nIf the Slowlane is your “get rich” strategy I can make a likely assumption: You’re \nnot rich and you never will be. Wow, how could I be so sure? Simple. The Slowlane \nstrategy is rooted in Uncontrollable Limited Leverage, or ULL (pronounced “yule”). \nIf you need help remembering this important concept, just think, “If the Slowlane \nis your plan, ‘ULL’ never get rich.”\nUncontrollable Limited Leverage is the disturbing evidence that proves the \nSlowlane’s futility. How do you get rich in the Slowlane? You get a great-paying job, \nsave money, live frugal, invest in the stock market, and repeat for 50 years. If you \nmine this strategy into its mathematical constructs, you’ll find that the variables \nthat define the plan cannot be controlled nor leveraged.\nu ncon TroLL ab Le Limi Ted LeV erage ( uLL) – Par T 1\nWhy is ULL so important? To accumulate financial wealth, you need to attract large \nsums of money. To attract large sums of money, you need two things: 1) Control \nand 2) Leverage. The Slowlane has neither and that truth is exposed when you \nreverse engineer the strategy into its mathematical equivalent, or its wealth uni -\nverse. Uncover the mathematics behind the plan and you uncover its weakness! \nWhen the Slowlane is deconstructed, you find two variables: 1) The “primary\n\f\n79\npART 4 — mediocRiTy: The slowlAne RoAdmApincome source,” which defines how income is earned, and 2) The “wealth accelera-\ntor,” which defines how wealth is accumulated. The Slowlaner’s primary income \nsource comes from “a job,” while the wealth acceleration vehicle comes from \n“market investments” like 401 Ks and mutual funds. Put it together and you arrive \nat the Slowlaner’s wealth equation: \nWEALTH = (Job) + (Market Investments)\nThe primary income source        The wealth accelerator\nUnder this plan, income from a job funds both lifestyle and market investments. \nHowever, to uncover the prohibitive ULL within the plan, we have to factor these \nvariables further, starting with the job variable. \nThe w arden o F w eaLTh: i n Trinsic Va Lue\nHow is money earned in a job? Intrinsic value. \nIntrinsic value is determined by the marketplace and is the price at which \nyou can trade your time for money. Intrinsic value is what you earn working \na job. How much is someone willing to pay you for what you offer to society? \nIntrinsic value is measured in units of time, either hourly or annually. If you’re paid  \n$10/  hour to flip burgers at the neighborhood grill, your intrinsic value is $10 per \nhour. If you’re an accountant and earn a $120,000 annual salary, your intrinsic \nvalue is $120,000 per year. \nJOB [Intrinsic Value] = Hourly Rate of Pay × Hours Worked\n~ or ~\nJOB [Intrinsic Value] = Annual Salary\nNotice that intrinsic value is measured in units of TIME . This “time attach -\nment” introduces the Slowlane’s first punitive element of wealth creation. Can you \ncontrol time? Can you leverage time? You can’t. Your time is limited to 24 hours \nof exchange. If you earn $200/hour, you can’t miraculously demand to work 400 \nhours in one day. If you earn $50,000/year, you can’t miraculously demand to \nwork 400 years in your life. Time has no leverage. \nFor the hourly worker, your maximum upper limit is 24 hours, and guess what. \nThere’s nothing you can do to change this limit. In theory, you can trade 24 hours \nof your day for income, but you can’t trade more. Of course, working 24 hours a \nday is humanly impossible, so 8 to 12 hours per day are traded.\nFor the salaried worker, the prohibition is the same. You can’t work more years \nthan your normal life expectancy. What is the upper limit of this exchange? Forty, \nfifty years? In all of recorded history, no human has ever worked 10,000 years of\n\f\n80\nthe millionaire fastlane his or her life. Whether you’re paid hourly or annually—it doesn’t matter—you \ncan’t leverage time!\nConsider this. Is 12 a large number? Or 50? Are these numbers predisposed to \ncreate millionaires? They aren’t, and it exposes why the mathematics of a job are \nwealth punitive: Your time is limited to small numbers and cannot be leveraged. \n“Hours worked” or “annual salary” are mathematically inept because they’re based \non time measurements that cannot be controlled or manipulated. Mathematics \ndoesn’t lie; 12 will always be less than 10,000,000. If leverage is limited, so is \nwealth creation. Small numbers do not make millionaires.\nBehind limited leverage is another corrosive wealth killer—no control. Can you \ncontrol your employer? Can you control your salary? Can you control the economy? \nCan you earn $50,000 one year and next year bank $50 million? Can you control \nanything about your job, including your measly 4% pay raise? You might think \nyou can by job-hopping, but you can’t. Control is weak, if not absent. \nc om Pound i n Teres T: w ha T “They” d on’ T TeLL y ou\nThe second variable in the Slowlane wealth equation is the “primary wealth accel-\nerator,” which comes from market investments like mutual funds, 401 Ks, and other \ntraditional investments touted by gurus and financial advisers. These investments \nuse the financial strategy known as “compound interest,” which is a mathematical \nconstruct that outlines the power of interest accumulation over great periods of time. \nThe fundamental sell of compound interest is the old guru swan song regurgitated \nad nauseum: $10,000 invested today will be worth gazillions in 40 years. Invest \n$250 a month for 50 years and you will retire rich! Used correctly, “compound \ninterest” is a powerful ally to wealth; used for Slowlane purposes and it dredges \nthe wealth road trip to a crawl. Why? Again, the puzzle is solved if you exploit the \nmath—the answer plays sibling to why a job won’t make you rich: time. \nWealth creation via compound interest requires the passing of time and lots \nof it. Like a job, compound interest, or market investments such as mutual funds \nand 401 Ks, can’t be leveraged nor can they be controlled. They rely on deficient \nmath to create wealth.\nInasmuch as the income you make in a job is measured in an hourly rate or \nan annual salary, the wealth acceleration process of “compound interest” is also \nmeasured in time (years) multiplied by a yearly yield. Let’s again review the phys-\nics, the mathematical formula for the Slowlane pathology to wealth:\nWEALTH = (Job) + (Market Investments)\nThe primary income source         The wealth accelerator\n\f\n81\npART 4 — mediocRiTy: The slowlAne RoAdmApOr factored:\nWEALTH = [Intrinsic Value (Yearly)] + [Compound Interest (Yearly)]\nThe primary income source                  The wealth accelerator\nFactored further:\nWEALTH = (Time × Hourly or Salaried Value) + Invested Sum × (1 + Yield) time\nThe primary income source                  The wealth accelerator\nLike a job, the flaw in “compound interest” lies in the same mathematical \nrestrictions in which numbers work AGAINST you instead of FOR you. Take a look \nat this chart, which highlights the effect of compound interest and that $10,000 \ninvestment.\n$10,000 Investment\nTime \n(Years)\nRate of Growth\n5% 10 % 15% 20 %\n5 $ 12 ,763 $16,105 $20,114 $24,883\n10 $ 16 ,289 $25,937 $40,456 $61.917\n15 $ 20 ,789 $41,772 $81,371 $154.070\n20 $ 26 ,553 $67, 275 $163,665 $383,376\n25 $ 33 ,864 $108,347 $329,190 $953,962\n30 $ 43 ,219 $174,494 $662,118 $2,373,763\n35 $ 55 ,160 $281,024 $1,331,755 $5,906,682\n40 $ 70 ,400 $452,593 $2,678,635 $14,697,7 16\nA Slowlane guru preaches that a $10,000 investment grown at 15% will be \nworth over $2.5 million dollars in 40 years!!! Hooray!!!\nWhat don’t they tell you? They don’t tell you that a 15% return year-after-year \nis impossible unless you invest with Bernie Madoff or Charles Ponzi. They don’t \ntell you that in 40 years you’ll be dead, and if you’re not, you’ll be close. They \ndon’t tell you that in 40 years, your $2.5 million will likely be worth $250,000 in \ntoday’s dollars and that a gallon of milk will cost $12.00. They don’t tell you that\n\f\n82\nthe millionaire fastlane this method of wealth acceleration is not what they use. They don’t tell you plenty, \nand yet you’re supposed to believe it without question.\nu ncon TroLL ab Le Limi Ted LeV erage ( uLL) - Par T 2\nFor compound interest to be effective, you need three things: \n1) TIME, as measured in years. \n2) A favorable YEARLY INVESTMENT YIELD within those years. \n3) An INVESTED SUM, repeatedly invested. \nThese three variables make up the latter portion of our Slowlane wealth \nequation:\nCompound Interest = Invested Sum × (1 + Yield) time\nAlthough this is a simplified version of a more complicated equation, the point \nof this analysis is its variable components. Compound interest demands that your \ninvestments yield a predictable 10% return per year. Good luck with that 40-year \ngamble. Have the markets ever lost 20% in one year? Or 40%? They have, and \nwhen they do, your hard-earned savings evaporate. \nYou see, wealth acceleration via compound interest is deficient because its vari-\nables are deficient . Neither time nor yield can be leveraged or controlled. Again, \nmeet my friend Uncontrollable Limited Leverage.\nCan you demand a 2,000% return on your money this year? Can you demand \nyour investment time horizon increase from the standard 40 years to 400 years? \nAgain, the numbers can’t be leveraged. Your upper limit of time investment hori-\nzon is 50 years. Yield is worse—6%, 8%, or 10% yearly investment returns are \ntypical standards. Time is restrained by the years in your life, yield is restrained \nby the average yield of typical market investments, and sum is limited because \nyour means of creating income comes from a job—also limited! The only way to \nsubvert the mathematical weakness of compound interest is to start with a large \nnumber, and large numbers require leverage!\nAdditionally, like a job, you can’t control compound interest. Can you demand \nyour bank pay 25% interest on your savings? Hey, Mr. Slowlane Bank, I demand a \n25% yield on my savings account! Can you control the economy? Hey, Mr. Economy, \ncan you guarantee me low unemployment and a business-friendly tax environment? \nCan you control the average yield of the stock market? Hey, Mr. Stock Market, I’m \ntired of 8% returns, can you give me 250% this year? Funny stuff! Can you control \nanything in this equation other than a furious, labor-intensive search for the best \ninvestments to ensure you eek out another marginal 1%? You can’t.\n\f\n83\npART 4 — mediocRiTy: The slowlAne RoAdmApw hy m u Tua L Funds and 401 ks w on’ T m ake y ou r ich\nIn 2008, I went to a fixed-income investment seminar given by a major brokerage \nhouse. Fixed-income investments are instruments like municipal and corporate \nbonds. Approximately 50 people attended the standing-room-only seminar. I sat \nin the back and surveyed the crowd. Remove the gray hair, the socks-n-sandals \ncombos, the canes, and the wheelchairs and what was left? Just me. I was the \nyoungest person in the room (and heck, I’m not even that young anymore). How \ndoes a thirty-something get in a room full of retirees?\nThe people in the room were Slowlane success stories. They used time to accel-\nerate wealth, and what it got them was old age. I don’t say that to be mean-spirited \nto older generations, but to cast light on the point: Compound interest (401 Ks, \nmutual funds, the stock market) cannot accelerate wealth fast.\nAccording to research and marketing firm The Harrison Group (Harrison -\nGroupInc.com), only 10% of penta-millionaires (net worth $5 million) report that \ntheir wealth came from passive investments. Age data was not provided but you \ncan guess that none of the 10% were under 30.\nThink about it. Have you ever met a college student who got rich investing in \nmutual funds or his employer’s 401 K? How about the guy who bought municipal \nbonds in 2006 and retired in 2009?

With inflation, the real pur -\nchasing power is $500. My spare change bucket on my kitchen table was a better \ninvestment. Had I invested $1 million, I’d have lost more than $400,000. And \nthis is the Slowlaner’s anointed weapon of wealth? Hilarious! Millions worship \nthe Slowlane roadmap with “buy and hold” as Main Street, a Main Street that is \ndecades long, imperiled by hazards, and rarely routes to wealth. \nI recently heard a Slowlane prognosticator proclaim the effectiveness of “Get \nRich Slow” by citing this tasty factoid: If at the end of 1940 you had invested $1,000 \nin the stocks of the S&P500 you would now have $1,341,513. So let’s examine this \nfact, assuming it is fact.\n1) It’s 1940 and assume you are 21 years old. \n2)  It’s 1940 and you somehow got your hands on $1,000, which in today’s dollars \nis about $15,000.\n3) You took that $1,000 in 1940s money and did as above.\nCongratulations! It is NOW 2011 and you are 91 years old, rich with $1,341,513. \nOr if you were lucky to get your $1,000 ON BIRTH , you’d now be 71 years old! Yes, \nfolks, it’s time to get excited! “Get Rich Slow” is going to make you rich! Just ignore \nyour 74-year life expectancy and make sure your wheelchair comes equipped with \nchrome rims. Seriously, how does anyone get excited over this crap? \nThe sL ow Lane’s TraiT orous r eLaTionshi P wiTh Time \nCompound interest and a job have the same disease: the sinful and gluttonous \nconsumption of your time while forsaking control. Both variables within the \nSlowlane wealth equation are anchored by time—time traded in a job and time \ntraded in market investments. Time becomes the lynchpin for wealth that con -\ngenitally ties to the mathematical handicaps of mortality: 24 hours in a day and a \n50-year work-life expectancy. Yes, “getting rich” is a function of time. Unless you \nplan on living forever, this relationship is dubiously foolhardy. Why? Because to \ntrade your time away is to trade your wealth away. \nExamine these pathetically common examples. Assume a 5% savings rate on \ngross salary and an annual investment yield of 8% per year. We’ll exclude taxes \nand inflation.\nSalary @ $25,000/yr, save $1,250/year, invested over 40 yrs @ 8% = $362,895\nSalary @ $50,000/yr, save $2,500/year, invested over 40 yrs @ 8% = $725,791\nSalary @ $75,000/yr, save $3,750/year, invested over 40 yrs @ 8% = $1,088,686\nSalary @ $100,000/yr, save $5,000/year, invested over 40 yrs @ 8% = $1,451,581\nSalary @ $150,000/yr, save $7,500/year, invested over 40 yrs @ 8% = $2,177,132"

If you are 30 years old, you \nwill be 70 years old. If you are 40 years old, you’ll be dead. Sorry, but that’s beyond \nlife expectancy. \nSo at these ages, does this money and the freedom it buys sound appealing? \nAlso, do you realize that this money will have 50% of today’s buying power? Forty \nyears ago you could buy a car for $3,000 and a loaf of bread for 20 cents. Lest we \nnot forget the other lofty assumptions, gainful employment and a robust economy \nthat behests a safe 8% per year. In 2008 the markets lost 50%. I guess the gurus \nforgot to mention these anomalies.\nFolks, you don’t want millions to accompany your cane, you want it to accom-\npany your youth.\nEvery day, people sacrifice their time for tiny nuggets of wealth, where time \nis the liability and not the asset. Anything that steals time and doesn’t have the \npower to free time is a liability.\nWithin the Slowlane, time is mistreated like an effervescent fountain that runs \nforever. Unfortunately, the mortality rate is 100% and life’s prognosis is death. Some \nday you will die, and, hopefully, 60% of your time wasn’t squandered in a cubicle \nwhile your children grew up and your spouse cheated with the yoga instructor. \nThe sL ow Lane i s a P Lan o F h o Pe\nThe Slowlane dilutes your control. You’re reading this book because you want to \ncontrol your financial destiny, NOT put it in the hands of some company or the \nstock market. If you want to get rich, you have to control and leverage the variables \nin your financial plan —any financial plan without control immediately disinte -\ngrates into a plan of hope. Hope I don’t get laid off! Hope my stocks rebound! \nHope I get that promotion! Hope my hours aren’t cut! Hope my company doesn’t \ngo bankrupt! Hope, hope, and hope! Sorry, hope isn’t a plan!\nThe Slowlane plan rests in a mathematical prison, with time as the warden. \nTo create explosive wealth fast, you must abandon the Slowlane formula and \nits lecherous relationship to time. Wealth is built with time as an asset, not as a \nliability!\nYet, the Slowlaner’s reaction to Uncontrollable Limited Leverage is predictable: \nThey embark on an errant fight against the one variable they perceive as controlla-\nble—their intrinsic value. The Slowlaner argues, “I must make more money!” And \nthat fight is fought futilely with an expensive education. \nc ha PTer s ummary: Fas TLane d is Tinc Tions\n • Slowlane wealth is improbable due to Uncontrollable Limited Leverage \n(ULL).\n • The first variable in the Slowlane wealth equation evolves from a job that\n\f\nfactors to intrinsic value that equates to your nominal value for each unit of \nyour life traded.\n • Intrinsic value is the value of your time set by the marketplace and is measured \nin units of time, either hourly or yearly.\n • In the Slowlane, intrinsic value (regardless of its time measurement) is numeri-\ncally inhibited because there are only 24 hours in the day (for the hourly worker), \nand the average lifespan is 74 years (for the salaried worker).\n • Like the Slowlaner’s primary income source (a job), the Slowlaner’s wealth \nacceleration vehicle (compound interest) is also pegged to time.\n • Like a job, compound interest is mathematically futile and cannot be manipu-\nlated. You cannot force-feed the market (or the economy) to give you phenom-\nenal returns, year after year.\n • Wealth cannot be accelerated when pegged to mathematics based on time.\n • Time is your primordial fuel and it should not be traded for money.\n • Your time should not be an expendable resource for wealth because wealth \nitself is composed of time.\n • Your mortality makes time mathematically retarded for wealth creation.\n • If you don’t control the variables inherent in your wealth universe, you don’t \ncontrol your financial plan.\n\f\n87\n13\nThe Futile Fight:  \nEducation\nThe only thing that interferes with my learning is my education.\n~ Albert Einstein\nThe Figh T a gains T u ncon TroLL ab Le Limi Ted LeV erage: educa Tion\nThe Slowlaner’s natural reaction to the Uncontrollable Limited Leverage ( ULL) \ninherent in their wealth equation is to wage war with intrinsic value by deploying \nthe education weapon. Since ULL defines the Slowlane, the Slowlaner rationalizes \nthat the only variable worthy of escalation is their rate of pay. I need to make six \nfigures! I need to make more money! So, predictably, they go back to school and \nget an MBA or some certification. They’ll argue, “MBA grads earn 15% more!” or \n“The starting salary of a certified PMP is $120,000 year!” \nFor example, Steve Ambrose enrolls into an MBA program to sweeten his cre -\ndentials. The cost of the MBA is $44,000 and 800 hours. Steve justifies this twofold \nexpense (time and money) because he anticipates his intrinsic value to rise. Upon \ncompletion, Steve expects to be worth more to his company and worth more in the \ncompetitive marketplace. Unfortunately, he still trades his time for money—just \nat a higher rate, yet still uncontrolled and unleveraged.\nAnother example is my friend who enrolled in a project management certifi -\ncation class that ate five eight-hour Saturdays from her life and cost $2,700. Her \ngoal? A project management credential that would raise her intrinsic value in the \nmarketplace. As a certified project manager, she exposes herself to new opportu -\nnities at higher grades of pay. But still, a trade of time for money.\nWhether consciously or not, the Slowlaner believes that elevating intrinsic \nvalue can create wealth. Want to be highly paid right out of college? Go to medical\n\f\n88\nthe millionaire fastlane school and become a doctor. As a physician, your intrinsic value is now worth \n$200 per hour. Become an engineer, a lawyer, or an accountant—all highly paid, \nprofessional, salaried positions. Typically, a formal college education is used to \nserve Slowlane purposes—an explicit attempt to raise intrinsic value. Fight that \nintrinsic value variable!\nno T aLL  educa Tion i s c rea Ted e qua L\nThe problem with formal education used to raise intrinsic value is that it’s ungodly \nexpensive in time and money. Not a week goes by when I don’t hear about some \nfreshly minted MBA graduate who struggles to pay his student loans while work -\ning a mid-grade job he could have gotten out of high school. Debt that traps you \nto a job is not good debt. A preoccupation to become “highly educated” could be \na Trojan horse to your freedom. \nNot all education is created equal. Some education can roadblock your wealth \nroad trip. If an education entombs you under a mountain of debt and shackles you \nto a job for the rest of your life, is it really a good education? If an MBA increases \nyour salary by 15% but takes 15 years to pay, was it a good investment?\nIt’s a great myth: To get rich you need an expensive college degree. Hogwash. \nA degree isn’t a prerequisite to Fastlane wealth. Some of the richest Fastlaners \nare people who never finished either high school or college. Bill Gates, Steven \nSpielberg, Richard Branson, Michael Dell, Felix Dennis, David Geffen, and John \nPaul DeJoria all dropped out of school to pursue Fastlane objectives. How dare \nthey get rich and not be “educated”? \nsL ow Lane e n TraP men T\nFinancing expensive college tuition for an education is a dangerous game that can \nlead to Slowlane entrapment: conformity and education servitude.\nA typical collegiate study progresses from general knowledge to very specific \nskill sets. For example, while studying finance I learned complex mathematical \nformulas that aided in financial decision-making, things like “lease or buy” and \n“return on investment.” These concepts are specific tools to a trade that can hinder \nyour future options. The prescribed path for graduates with finance degrees was \nto get a job in the financial sector, an insurance company, an accounting firm, or \nan investment house. \nMy education had the indirect and unintended consequence of restricting my \noptions to specific disciplines based on an educative skill set. The result? Conformity \nand limited choice. If there aren’t opportunities in my field, my education becomes \nmarginalized and devalued. If the opportunities available require less education \n(say, a BS) than I have (MBA), I become overqualified and unemployable. If my skills \nerode in practicality based on technological evolution, my education becomes \ndeprecated and my value to society plummets accordingly.\n\f\n89\npART 4 — mediocRiTy: The slowlAne RoAdmApThe second educational entrapment danger is “education servitude.” While the \nSidewalker deals with “Lifestyle Servitude,” the Slowlaner wrestles with “Education \nServitude” (freedom eroded by education) that traps the victim to a job. Has your \neducation indentured you to a job? Advanced degrees are not cheap. According \nto The College Board the average college degree, including room and board, now \ncosts nearly $60,000. Prefer the prestige of a private school? The tab will set you \nback a Ferrari. This kind of debt buries the dreams of your youth and puts them \npermanently bound to the Slowlane or worse, the Sidewalk.\nConsider the statistics. In 2007, the Washington Post reported that, according \nto Nellie Mae, the big student loan service provider, by the time college students \nare seniors, 56% of them will have four or more credit cards with an average bal -\nance of $2,864. According to a research report by Demos- USA.org, a public policy \nresearch and advocacy organization, people in the 18–24 age bracket spend nearly \n30% of their monthly income on debt repayment. This is double from 20 years ago. \nA survey of college borrowers found that the average college senior graduated with \nnearly $19,000 in student loan debts, and graduate degree pursuers more than \n$45,000. A 2007 Charles Schwab survey revealed that teenagers believe when they \nget older they will earn an average salary of $145,000. The reality? Adults with \na college degree earned an average of $54,000. Unfortunately, the future isn’t so \nbright that you have to wear shades. The truth behind reality and expectation is \nabout a $100,000 chasm. This disparity might explain why the debts of our youth \nhave exploded as they bridge their reality to expectation. If I can’t make $145 ,000 , \nI can look like I make $145 ,000 !\nThe best excuse people have for not having wealth is “I don’t have time.” Well, \nwhy don’t you have time? Because you have a job. Why do you have a job? Because \nyou need one. Why do you need one? Because you have bills to pay. Why do you \nhave bills to pay? Because you have debt. Why do you have debt? Oh yes, because \nyou went to school for six years and have six figures in student loans.\nIf you financed your advanced education with debt, the debt automatically \nbecomes parasitic and traps you into forced job servitude, and that destroys free -\ndom. While you might earn more, work is forced to stave off the debt. The debt is \nparasitic because it fails to free time and instead creates indentured time. Sadly, \nthe parasitic debt is unforgiving and isn’t sympathetic to the source. Whether you \nowe $35,000 for your awesome BMW  or for student loans, debt steals freedom and \nforces indentured time.\nc ha PTer s ummary: Fas TLane d is Tinc Tions\n • Slowlaners attempt to manipulate intrinsic value by education.\n • Indentured time is time you spend earning a living. It is the opposite of free \ntime.\n • Parasitic debt is debt that creates indentured time and forces work.\n\f\n90\n14\nThe Hypocrisy of the Gurus \nThere was a time when a fool and his money were soon parted,  \nbut now it happens to everybody.\n~ Adlai Stevenson\nyou’ Ve been d u Ped\nSuppose after college you’re getting a bit pudgy around the middle and decide it’s \ntime to get back in shape. You enroll in a community college class called “Healthy \nNutrition: Eat Your Way to a Beautiful Body.”\nOn the first day of class, you arrive early, seat yourself, and anxiously await \nthe class instructor. After a few minutes, an obese man walks into the room and \nwaddles to the front of the class. You think, “Wow, he’s fat . . . but he’s here to \nchange that . . . good for him!” As the man profusely sweats while fumbling with \na stack of papers, you glance at the student chair near the man and wonder if he \ncan fit on it . . . he’s twice the size of the chair! \nThen suddenly you’re hit with the paradox. This isn’t a student but the instruc-\ntor! Are you freaking kidding me? How can this man effectively teach a class \ncalled “Healthy Nutrition: Eat Your Way to a Beautiful Body” when he is not a \nmodel of his teaching? How can anyone take him seriously? Bewildered at the \nhypocrisy, you leave the class and head to the bursar’s office, intent on getting a \ntuition refund.\nWhen it comes to gurus and financial advisers this is what you must do: leave \nclass and request a refund because they’re guilty of a Paradox of Practice. \nThe Parado X o F Prac Tice\nThe Paradox of Practice asks, “Do you practice what you preach? Are you a model, \nan exemplification of what you teach?”"

These fat behemoths are walking \nhypocrisies on how to live a life of health and fitness. Listen to these folks with \nan entertainment expectation, not advice. Good advice comes from the guy who \nscores all the touchdowns—not the guy shut out in the fourth quarter!

If someone tells you how they \n“scored,” make sure they disclose their real method to wealth, not the illusion \nconcealing the real culprit. Sadly, it’s virtually impossible to get good, practical \nmoney advice, because most gurus live a Paradox of Practice. Yes, gurus are rarely \nrich because of their advice, but rich because they’re successful Fastlaners who \ncovertly hide their Paradox of Practice.\n\f\n92\nthe millionaire fastlane These paradoxical metaphors described earlier befit the hypocrisy of the people \nwho you’ve entrusted with your financial roadmap. You’re sold blindly down the \nriver by a ride they’ve never completed. Meanwhile, they gaze at you comfort -\nably above in their corporate jet, drinking champagne. No one tells you the real, \nunadulterated story behind their road to wealth, but I will. \nThe Slowlane roadmap is sanctimoniously trumpeted by best-selling book \nauthors who dispense financial advice through TV, radio, and books. The strate -\ngies they sell are a travesty of grand illusions. Do you seriously think these people \nare rich from their preachings? Or, are they selling you the Slowlane while they get \nrich in the Fastlane?\nLet me hypothesis about the probable wizardry behind their charade. \nFirst is “Suze.” Suze preaches mutual funds, dollar-cost averaging, 401 Ks. We \ncan absorb Suze in many media: radio, TV , and in any of her half-dozen books. \nHer grille is everywhere. She’s the wretched Slowlane poster child, a high-volume \nproducer of Slowlane junkets spewed to millions. So what’s the problem? Ask \nyourself this: Is Suze rich because she followed her own advice like municipal \nbonds, dollar-cost-averaging and 401 Ks? The probable hypocrisy—the Paradox of \nPractice—is that Suze’s method of creating wealth doesn’t appear to be the road \nshe travels, nor teaches. Is Suze Fastlane rich because she leverages the Fastlane \nroadmap while she pitches you the Slowlane? Is she worth millions  because she \nfollowed her own advice? Or because she sold millions  of books? Is her wealth \nequation different from the one she teaches? Things that make you go hmmm…\nIn a 2007 article Suze was quoted as admitting to having the bulk of her \nwealth (an estimated $25 million) in bonds, primarily municipals. Additionally, \nshe admits that only 4% of her wealth is tied-up in the stock market because “if \nI lose a million dollars, personally I don’t care.” Wow, and yet, this is the vehicle \nyou should entrust to build your  wealth? How exactly did Ms. Suze acquire that \n$25 million nest egg? Because of her advice which champions the stock market, \nmutual funds, IRA s, bonds, and treasuries? Or, did she use the Fastlane road -\nmap, amass wealth fast via explosive net income, and then pour her wealth into \nthese instruments? Yet, her advice for people at the precipice of poverty is that \nthey should invest in the stock market to create wealth when it appears like she \nhasn’t. Folks, the rich use the markets for income and wealth preservation—not \nto create it!\nThen there’s David. As I thumbed through David’s many books, I was inun-\ndated with an alarming quantity of Slowlane ilk: compound interest tables, save \n10% of your paycheck, stop drinking expensive coffee, and other chronic Slowlane \ndiatribes. Again, the Paradox of Practice rears its ugly mug. Did David get rich \nfrom his advice? Or from selling 11 books, over and over several million times, \noften regurgitating the same Slowlane sludge until you can’t take it anymore?\n\f\n93\npART 4 — mediocRiTy: The slowlAne RoAdmApAnd finally, we have Robert, who hails from Hawaii and has two dads—one \nrich, one poor. “Double-Dad Robert” bellicosely explains the real definition of \nassets and that sophisticated investors are deep into real estate. On national tele -\nvision, Robert once bragged about his Lamborghini and I found this extravagant \nexposition ironic, yet disingenuous. Why? Isn’t Robert showcasing the fruit of his \nteachings? Perhaps.\nRobert is a Fastlane success story. He created and built a brand worth millions. \nBut the curious question is this: Which came first? The best-selling book or the \nLamborghini? Is there a Paradox of Practice underneath? Did Robert have this status \nicon “pre-book” by leveraging his real estate teachings? Or did the Lamborghini \narrive after selling millions of books? Robert has undoubtedly amassed a great \ndeal of wealth selling books, games, and seminars. Is it possible you’re being sold \none wealth equation while the architect of the game uses another ? \nGurus fill a market need and I don’t deny it. However consider this: Are they \nbeing truthful about their paradox and their magic potion? Are they rich because \nof what they preach, or what they sell? Once you’re familiar with Fastlane math -\nematics, it should become clear to you which gurus are likely guilty of the paradox. \nIs the underlying mathematical equation which governs their teachings the same \none that made them rich? If the “do as I say” doesn’t match the “do as I do”, you \nshould be suspicious. \nWhat makes me different is this: The Fastlane concepts in this book gave me \nfinancial independence. I already have financial freedom—the nice house, the \nsports cars, and the flashy rapper credit card. I don’t need this book to get me \nthese things. I also confess this Fastlane disclaimer: This book has the power to \nmake me wealthier because it leverages the same wealth equation I teach you. In \nother words, the “do as I say” matches the “do as I do.”\nsL ow Lane gurus admi T Fai Lure\nOn a Slowlane financial radio show, a caller sought advice: In a few months the \nrecession destroyed more than 50% of her savings, which had taken her nearly 10 \nyears to accumulate. The Slowlane guru’s advice? A palliative “Stick to the plan.” \nRecommit. Rebuild.\nIn other words, my crappy plan has failed you, has taken 11 years to fail you, yet \nstand by it. Hope the economy rebounds. Hope the economy never sees another \nrecession. Hope, hope, and hope. And yes, please buy my newest book, Rebuild . . . \nEconomic recessions expose the Slowlane as a risky fraud with lifetime ramifi-\ncations. Since these gurus make their rich livelihood selling the Slowlane roadmap, \nthey need you to believe it works. Their wealth comes from your belief.

He never sees the promise of the journey \nbecause life has no guarantees.\nSadly, Slowlane wealth is akin to this long, perilous journey through the desert. \nIt’s a trip that takes decades to finish, starves your life, and makes no promises. \nYes, graduate from college, get a good job, entrust your money to the stock market, \nserve the boss well, and you might be rewarded. In today’s harrowing financial \nclimate, I’m surprised people still believe it.\nBut people do, and in legions. When I see sales figures for Slowlane books, I’m \ndumbfounded. Millions sold. How sad. Millions being led astray down a path lit -\ntered with dangerous potholes and detours, a road that takes years to travel for a \nfar-fetched promise of a freer tomorrow. To assume that you will live a long, healthy \nlife is arrogant. To assume that life won’t throw you any curves is naïve. For the \nSlowlane to prevail, it assumes life is predictable and forgiving. \nIt isn’t. You lose your job. You get sick. The car needs a new transmission. You get \nmarried. You get divorced. You have kids. You have a child with special needs. You \nhave aging parents who need care. The economy dips into recession or depression.\n\f\n96\nthe millionaire fastlane Life is a menagerie littered with crisis points, which make the Slowlane roadmap \na risky bet that consumes your most precious asset: time.\nseVen sL ow Lane d angers\nPeople drive the Slowlane because it’s what they’ve been told to drive. They believe \nthe risks are minimal and it’s safe. After all, 90% of all new businesses fail after five \nyears, so the “Fastlane” can’t be any safer! If you lob a little logic into the Slowlane \nnarratives you’ll find that it’s extremely hazardous and a plan based entirely on \nhope. Assumptions—decades of them—expose the Slowlane’s true risks. Choose \nto travel the road and choose to gamble. Here are the risks:\n1) The danger of your h ealth\n The Slowlane HOPES you will live long enough to enjoy the fruits of your sav -\nings as you hit your late stage years. Remember, you will have millions when \nyou retire at 65! Will you be healthy enough to enjoy it? Alive? If you can’t \nwork your job, you can’t make money. If you can’t work, what happens to this \nplan? Also, avoid other calamities; hope your job stress doesn’t kill you and \nyour family remains healthy. \n2) The danger of the Job\n The Slowlane HOPES that you’ll be gainfully employed at all times, safely climbing \nthe corporate ladder year after year. You must avoid layoffs, corporate politics, \nfirings, poor industry cycles, job skill degradation, and bad job markets. \n3) The danger of your h ome\n Home equity is lauded as a middle-class wealth vehicle. Many gurus have \nshouted from the rooftops, “Retire on your home equity!” and “Your home is an \nasset!” Capital BS. The Slowlane HOPES that real estate values always rise, and \nit’s patently false. In 2008, the value of my home equity plummeted $800,000. \nI disavow my home as an investment and, thankfully, I do not rely on it.\n4) The danger of the c ompany\n Not many companies outlive the centuries. If your retirement faith is put into \none company in the form of either 1) your job, 2) your pension, or 3) their stock, \nyou HOPE the company survives. You make a bet. Many retirees discover too \nlate that their retirement pensions are lost to mismanagement by company \nexecutives. Others who focus their wealth into one company stock accept \ngreat risk that the stock will be worth more in the future. If you assign your \nretirement unto others, you then accept external risks that you can’t control. \nWhen the torque of you’re financial plan resides with others, you’re likely to \nlose control.\n\f\n97\npART 4 — mediocRiTy: The slowlAne RoAdmAp5) The danger of your Lifestyle\n The Slowlane begs you to settle and become a miser. Want to own an exotic car? \nForget it. Want to live on a beach? Wishful thinking. If you cannot control your \ntemptations of lifestyle improvement (a nicer home, a nicer car, a nicer meal \nout), the Slowlane becomes slower and reverses course. The Slowlane HOPES \nyour “delayed gratification” moves to “no gratification.”\n6) The danger of the economy\n The Slowlane HOPES that your investments will yield a predictable 8% return \nyear after year. You must believe the theory that “buy and hold” works. It \ndoesn’t, because economic busts, recessions, and depressions happen. For \nexample, in 2008–2009, the equity markets lost nearly 60%. If you saved for \n15 years and amassed $100,000, it would now be worth $40,000. It would \ntake you 14 years at 8% yearly returns just to get back even! That equates to \nalmost 30 YEARS GONE ! And this doesn’t account for inflation, which makes \nyour $100,000 more like $50,000! \n7) The danger of the s idewalk\n Frustrated Slowlaners often revert to the Sidewalk. Why? Hope over control. \nWhen you can’t control time, when you can’t control your job, when you \ncan’t control five days of your life each week, you feel powerless. Emotions of \nhelplessness create an environment ripe for instant gratification and Lifestyle \nServitude. A study published in 2008 by the Journal of Consumer Research  \nfound that when people feel powerless and out of control, they have a strong \ndesire to buy things that convey a high status. Why do they feel powerless? \nSimple. In the Slowlane, you relinquish control because time is in control and \nthe gates to the Sidewalk reopen. Hope is not a plan.\nr esis Tance i s Fu TiLe\nWhen you perform an autopsy on the Slowlane you see its true colors: It’s slow, it \neats time, and it’s risky. When a Slowlaner realizes the plan isn’t working, he goes \ninto overdrive. Overdrive in the Slowlane is like pushing a car’s accelerator to the \nfloor, hoping its upper speed limits somehow will mystically extend higher, when \nin fact, the racetrack itself is the problem—not the accelerator.\nYet, a Slowlaner will try to manipulate his weak mathematical universe by try-\ning to make the variables malleable.\n • Manipulate intrinsic value by increasing hours worked. (I need to make more \nmoney!)\n • Manipulate intrinsic value by changing jobs or adding jobs. (I need to get \npaid more!)\n\f\n98\nthe millionaire fastlane  • Manipulate intrinsic value by going back to school. (I need a better career!)\n • Manipulate compound interest by seeking better investment yields. (I need \nbetter investments!)\n • Manipulate compound interest by expanding investment time horizon. (I need \nmore time!)\n • Manipulate compound interest by increasing the investment. (I need to save \nmore!)\nEach of these six responses is a futile attempt to manipulate the impotence of \nthe Slowlaner’s wealth equation. Unfortunately, the limitations of the mathematics \ncannot be subverted, and doing so results in dangerous cause-effects cycles. When \na Slowlaner wants to make more money, he increases his hours worked, switches \nto a better paying job, or adds jobs. When a Slowlaner wants to get paid more, he \ngoes back to school, hoping to increase intrinsic value. When a Slowlaner real -\nizes that a 3% investment return isn’t building wealth fast enough, bigger risks \nare assumed for bigger returns. When a Slowlaner watches 40% of his nest egg \ndisappear in an economic recession, he goes back to work arguing that five years \nis not enough to “get back to even.”\nYou can’t overcome the limitations of mathematics. A car that has a top speed \nof 10 mph will always have a top speed of 10 mph, no matter HOW HARD YOU \nPUSH THE ACCELERATOR. If you travel across the country at 10 mph, you’re going \nto need 40 years!\nThe Slowlane is predisposed to mediocrity because the numbers are always \nmediocre.\nThe Slowlane is risky because its variables are uncontrollable and leverage is \nabsent. ULL really means “ ULL” never get rich. Yet, lifestyle is the one variable \nSlowlaners can effectively manipulate. Unfortunately, this quickly turns Slowlane \nlife into a stale exhibition of misery. Yes, settle for less.\nw eaLTh Fai L: w rong e qua Tion. w rong Variab Le\nAt some point, the Slowlaner realizes he can’t force the stock market to yield bigger \nreturns. He can’t force a 200% pay raise. He can’t afford an advanced education \nto raise intrinsic value. Job-hopping offers little incremental pay upgrades. The \nSlowlaner is enslaved to his equation and resorts to manipulating the only control-\nlable variable, personal net income, which is increased by reducing expenses.\nPersonal Net Income = Intrinsic Value – Personal Expenses\nSlowlane gurus praise this strategy. The edicts are clear: Pay down your debt. \nDump the new car for an old one. Raise your insurance deductibles. Cancel \nyour credit cards and pay cash for everything. Quit buying $10 coffee at Starbucks."

Since wealth is tied \nto time and can’t be controlled, you’re left with kitchen scraps . . . lifestyle degra-\ndation in the form of expense reduction. Yup, become a cheapskate.\nWrong. Hoodwinking expenses does not create wealth. Exploding income \nand controlling expenses creates wealth. For example, when I routinely earned \n$100,000 per month, I accumulated wealth fast because I maintained control over \nmy expenses. As my income exponentiated, expenses grew linearly and weren’t \nneglected. If my income increased by 100%, expenses only grew by 10%. I didn’t \naccumulate wealth because of expense dickery. Income explosion and expense \ncontrol created wealth. \nSo what happens when a Slowlaner commits to the expense variable? Life \nbecomes about what you can’t do. You can’t take that trip. You can’t buy your \nkids a decent pair of shoes. You can’t own a dream car. You can’t subscribe to the \nmovie channels.

When you recognize the difference, you \ncan critique advice properly and assign it to its correct Fastlane or Slowlane box. \nmiLLionaires a re r ich . . . or a re They?\nI recently read an article about a young woman named Callie from the U.K. who, \nseveral years ago, won millions in a lottery, only to lose most of it shortly thereaf -\nter. Of course, “lose” implies that the entire bag of cash flew out of the car while \ncruising down the boulevard in her brand new convertible. \nShe didn’t “lose” it— she spent it. She was just 16 years old when she won the \n$3 million, and it took only six years for her to blow it: drugs, partying, exotic cars, \nbreast implants, and a jaw-dropping $730,000 in designer clothes. The problem? \nCallie thought she was rich and spent like she was rich. Surely she bought into her \ntitle: “I’m a millionaire.” While $3 million is a decent chunk of change, she needed \n$30 million for her lifestyle. \nWhich brings us to our famous word, “millionaire.” When you hear that word, \nwhat do you think?  Like wealth, you probably have visions of an extravagant life-\nstyle: boats, helicopters, mansions, and expensive jewelry. For decades, the term \n“millionaire” has been ubiquitously used to describe someone “rich.” \nExcept these visions of opulence describe a lifestyle of a millionaire elevated by \nthe Fastlane, not the Slowlane. Slowlane millionaires who don’t escape by fame or \ncorporate bastardization live differently. They own homes in innocuous middle-\nclass neighborhoods. They drive unassuming cars like Hondas or Toyotas, they \nvacation infrequently, they limit their dining expenses, they cut coupons, and they \nmax out their 401 Ks. They work five days a week at jobs they most likely hate and \ndiligently save 10% of their paychecks. Others own small businesses, franchises, \nand retail stores. Several national best-selling books have enlightened us: Yes, these \nare the “millionaires next door.” \nSadly, in today’s terms, a “millionaire” (net worth of $1,000,000) is simply \nupper middle class. A millionaire is not rich. Five million is the old one million. \nDepressing, I know.\nThis hidden truth is why many lottery winners go broke after a few years. \nWinners envision the lavish lifestyle and live it not knowing that several mil -\nlion dollars won’t support it! If you win a million bucks (which after taxes is only \n$600,000), your lifestyle shouldn’t change. If you try to live the “millionaire life -\nstyle” as shown on television, a fool and his money are soon parted.\nPlaying the lottery is a symptom of the Sidewalk. So why would it shock anyone \nto discover that a newly crowned lottery winner goes broke just years later? Lottery \nwinners assign “rich” to the word “millionaire,” so their fortune is fast spent on \nthe icons of wealth, and soon thereafter, they’re bankrupt. The word “millionaire” \nfooled them. Millionaire is middle class. To live a lifestyle normally reserved for \n“millionaires,” you will have to amass far more than $1 million. Having $1 million\n\f\n102\nthe millionaire fastlane doesn’t entitle you to a lifestyle of the rich and famous. You need at least $10 mil -\nlion for that. So when the media spoon-feed you the word “millionaire,” determine \nits perspective: Is it Slowlane and middle class? Or Fastlane and rich?\n12 d is Tinc Tions b eTween sL ow Lane and Fas TLane m iLLionaires\n 1)  Slowlane millionaires make millions in 30 years or more.

Fastlane millionaires \ncan live in luxury estates.\n 3)  Slowlane millionaires have MBA s. Fastlane millionaires hire people with \nMBAs.\n 4)  Slowlane millionaires let their assets drift by market forces. Fastlane millionaires \ncontrol their assets and possess the power to manipulate their value. \n 5)  Slowlane millionaires can’t afford exotic cars. Fastlane millionaires can afford \nto drive whatever they want.\n 6)  Slowlane millionaires work for their time.

Once you understand the roadmaps and their respective wealth \nequations, you can choose the one that will serve as your compass.\nw ha T i s T he Fas TLane?\nThe Fastlane is a business and lifestyle strategy characterized by Controllable \nUnlimited Leverage (CUL), hence creating an optimal environment for rapid \nwealth creation and extraordinary lifestyles. Definitively, pay attention to these \nfour segments:\n1) c ontrollable u nlimited Leverage (cu L)\nWhereas the Slowlane is defined by uncontrollable variables with no lever -\nage, the Fastlane exploits the opposite conditions: maximum control and \nleverage.\n2) b usiness \nYour own business, self-employment, and entrepreneurship are centrist to the \nFastlane, much like a job is to the Slowlane.\n3) Lifestyle \nThe Fastlane is a lifestyle choice: a commitment of blended beliefs, processes, \nand actions.\n4) r apid wealth c reation \nThe Fastlane is about creating large sums of wealth rapidly and beyond the \nconfines of “middle class.”\nHere is a story that best describes the Fastlane, and yes, this story is inspired \nfrom a real story posted on the Internet. \nAfter four long years, I sold my company for $32 million [RAPID WEALTH \nCREATION] and I wouldn’t change a thing. I’m happy I sold because I wanted \nto make money fast and transform paper money into real money. This deci -\nsion changed my life permanently.\nNow, I do whatever I want and I’m not the least bit bored. The world is \nmy playground; I travel, I learned two new languages and how to play piano. \nI play water sports, hike, and snowboard at least a month a year. I own three \nhomes, I watch pro sports and my favorite teams whenever I choose, watch \n3–4 movies a week, and read 1–2 books a week. Most of my time is spent\n\f\n109\npART 5 — weAlTh: The fAsTlAne RoAdmApwith my family, and I literally watch my two daughters grow before my eyes. \nMy family has lived on all four corners of the planet, including Australia \nand the Caribbean. \nLooking back, it wasn’t easy. I worked 12–16 hour days for four years, \nalmost always six days a week, and always a few hours on Sunday. We cre -\nated an awesome service and sold the crap out of it. [THE BUSINESS WITH \nC.U.L.] I remember tough times, and I had to put every dime of my money \ninto the company . . . we had less than 50 bucks in our account at least five \ntimes. Except for my family during those startup years, I sacrificed plenty; \nI canceled cable TV and I temporarily stopped doing a lot of things I enjoyed \nbecause I was committed to a goal and a dream of something far greater than \na lifetime job. [THE LIFESTYLE]\nNow, I am an investor in multiple startup companies and am making \nan impact I could have never imagined. I have no apologies or regrets. My \nlife rocks and I wouldn’t change a thing. If I didn’t make a choice to get into \nbusiness and start a company, I don’t know where I’d be.\nThis story epitomizes the Fastlane. A business was created; a lifestyle grew the \nbusiness, which opened up the expressway, and the expressway led to extraor -\ndinary wealth, which led to freedom. And yes, it isn’t for everyone. Question is:  \nIs it for you?\nThe Fas TLane m ind Pos Ts\nLike the other roadmaps, the Fastlane Roadmap contains the same mindposts \nor behavioral characteristics that drive the Fastlaner’s actions along the journey. \nThey are:\ndebt Perception: Debt is useful if it allows me to build and grow my system . \nTime Perception: Time is the most important asset I have, far exceeding money. \neducation Perception: The moment you stop learning is the moment you stop grow-\ning. Constant expansion of my knowledge and awareness is critical to my journey.\nmoney Perception: Money is everywhere, and it’s extremely abundant. Money is \na reflection of how many lives I’ve touched. Money reflects the value I’ve created. \nPrimary i ncome s ource: I earn income via my business systems and invest -\nments. \nPrimary w ealth a ccelerator:  I make something from nothing. I give birth to\n\f\n110\nthe millionaire fastlane assets and make them valuable to the marketplace. Other times, I take existing \nassets and add value to them.\nwealth Perception:  Build business systems for cash flow and asset valuation.\nwealth equation: Wealth = Net Profit + Asset Value\nstrategy:  The more I help, the richer I become in time, money, and personal \nfulfillment. \ndestination:  Lifetime passive income, either through business or investments.\nr esponsibility & c ontrol: Life is what I make it. My financial plan is entirely my \nresponsibility and I choose how I react to my circumstances.\nLife Perception:  My dreams are worth pursuing no matter how outlandish, and \nI understand that it will take money to make some of those dreams real.\nThese mindposts are what formulate the Fastlaner’s lifestyle. It drives \naction.\nThe Fas TLane r oadma P: Predis Posed To w eaLTh\nThe Fastlane Roadmap is predisposed to wealth because it operates under a wealth \nequation with controllable, unlimited variables, and the mathematical cage of time \nis removed. ULL is replaced with CUL. Correctly exploited, the roadmap reveals \na rapid road to wealth via unlimited mathematics evolving via “profit” or “asset \nvalue” or both.

Can’t you \nmake millions like they say on infomercials? \nThe distinction is that “get rich schemes” aren’t endemic of “Get Rich Quick” \nbut its evil twin, “Get Rich Easy.” “Get Rich Easy” shadows its innocent sibling, \nleaving a trail of victims to be blamed by its brother. “Get Rich Easy” parades in \nthe limelight and on late night television.

Manual labor was \nreplaced in favor of systems, an organized union of distinct parts that coalesced \ninto a specific production outcome. Long and arduous tasks manually handled \nby humans transformed into mechanization, expelling most human labor out of \nthe production equation. For that era, it was their version of “Get Rich Quick.” \nProducts that formerly took months to manufacture now took days.\nLikewise, financial freedom via the Fastlane Roadmap is like an industrial \nrevolution for wealth. The default road to wealth is manual labor, a fight against \ntime and intrinsic value . The rapid road to wealth is to industrialize the wealth \nprocess, to systematize it like our ancestors systematized production. The differ -\nences between the default road (the Slowlane) and the shortcut (the Fastlane) are \nbest demonstrated in an Egyptian parable. \nThe Parab Le o F Fas TLane w eaLTh\nA great Egyptian pharaoh summons his two young nephews, Chuma and Azur, \nand he commissions them to a majestic task: Build two monumental pyramids as \na tribute to Egypt. Upon completion of each nephew’s pyramid, Pharaoh prom -\nises each an immediate reward of kingship, retirement amidst riches, and lavish \nluxury for the rest of their natural lives. Additionally, each nephew must construct \nhis pyramid alone . \nChuma and Azur, both 18, know their daunting task will take years to com -\nplete. Nonetheless, each is primed for the challenge and honored by the Pharaoh’s \ndirective. They exit Pharaoh’s chambers ready to begin the long pyramid-building \nprocess.\nAzur begins work immediately. He slowly drags large heavy stones into a square \nformation. After a few months, the base of Azur’s pyramid takes shape. Townsfolk \ngather around Azur’s constructive efforts and praise his handiwork. The stones \nare heavy and difficult to move, and after one year of heavy labor, Azur’s perfect \nsquare foundation to the pyramid is nearly finished.\n\f\n113\npART 5 — weAlTh: The fAsTlAne RoAdmApBut Azur is perplexed. The plot of land that should bear Chuma’s pyramid is \nempty. Not one stone has been laid. No foundation. No dirt engravings. Nothing. \nIt’s as barren as it was a year ago when Pharaoh commissioned the job. \nConfused, Azur visits Chuma’s home and finds him in his barn diligently \nworking on a twisted apparatus that resembles some kind of human torture device. \nAzur interrupts, “Chuma! What the hell are you doing!? You’re supposed to be \nbuilding Pharaoh a pyramid and you spend your days locked in this barn fiddling \nwith that crazy machine?”\nChuma cracks a smile and says, “I am building a pyramid, leave me alone.”\nAzur scoffs, “Yeah, sure you are. You haven’t laid one stone in over a year!”\nChuma, engrossed and unfazed by his brother’s accusation retorts, “Azur, you’re \nshort-sightedness and thirst for wealth have clouded your vision. You build your \npyramid and I will build mine.”\nAs Azur walks away, he chides, “You fool! Pharaoh will hang you in the gallows \nwhen he discovers your treason.”\nAnother year passes and Azur solidifies the base of his pyramid and begins the \nsecond level. Except a problem arises. Azur struggles in his progress. The stones \nare heavy and he cannot raise them to the pyramid’s second level. Challenged by \nhis physical limitations, Azur recognizes his weakness: he needs more strength to \nmove heavier stones, and to do so, seeks the counsel of Bennu, Egypt’s strongest \nman. For a fee, Bennu trains Azur to build bigger and stronger muscles. With \ngreat strength, Azur anticipates the heavier stones will be easier to lift onto the \nhigher levels. \nMeanwhile, Chuma’s pyramid plot of land is still barren. Azur assumes his \nbrother has a deathwish since, by all appearances, Chuma is violating Pharaoh’s \nmandate. Azur forgets about his brother and his nonexistent pyramid.\nAnother year passes and Azur’s pyramid construction slows to a dishearten -\ning crawl. It often takes one month just to place one stone. Moving stones to the \nupper levels require great strength and Azur spends much of his time working \nwith Bennu to build greater strength. Additionally, Azur is spending most of his \nmoney on counseling fees and the exotic diet required for the training. Azur esti -\nmates at his current construction pace, his pyramid will be completed in another \n30 years. Unfazed, Azur lauds, “After three years, I’ve far surpassed my brother. \nHe hasn’t placed one stone yet! That fool!” \nThen, suddenly, one day while hauling a heavy stone up his pyramid, Azur \nhears a loud commotion erupting from the town square. The townsfolk, regular \nobservers to his work, abruptly abandon his plot to examine the celebratory fuss. \nCurious himself, Azur takes a break and leaves to investigate. \nSurrounded by a cheering crowd, Chuma trolls up the town square comman -\ndeering a 25-foot contraption, a towering machine built from a twisted maze of \ngantries, wheels, levers, and ropes.

After a short trawl to \nChuma’s barren pyramid plot, Azur’s suspicions are confirmed. \nWithin minutes, Chuma’s strange machine starts moving heavy stones and \nbegins to lay the foundation to his pyramid. One after another, the machine effort-\nlessly lifts the stones and softly places them side-by-side into place. Miraculously, \nthe machine requires little effort for Chuma’s operation. Crank a wheel attached \nto a rope and cantilever entwined by a gear system, and bingo! Heavy stones are \nmoved quickly and magically.\nWhile Azur’s pyramid foundation took over a year to build, Chuma lines up \nthe foundation to his pyramid within one week. The second level that Azur so \narduously struggled with is even more shocking: Chuma’s machine does the work \n30 times quicker. What took Azur two months takes Chuma’s machine two days. \nAfter 40 days, Chuma and his machine accomplish as much as Azur’s three years \nof toilsome work. \nAzur was destroyed. He spent years doing the heavy lifting while Chuma built \na machine to do it for him. \nInstead of honoring the machine, Azur vows, “I must get stronger! I must lift  \nheavier stones!” Azur continues the hard labor of pyramid building while Chuma \ncontinues to work the crank of his machine.\nAfter eight years, Chuma finishes his pyramid at age 26: three years to build the \nsystem and five years to reap the benefits of the system. The great pharaoh is pleased \nand does as promised. He rewards Chuma with kingship and endows him with \ngreat riches. Chuma never has to work another day in his life.\nMeanwhile, Azur continues to dredge away at the same old routine. Lift rocks, \nwaste time and money to get stronger, lift rocks, and get stronger. Sadly, Azur \nrefuses to acknowledge his flawed strategy and endures the same old process: \nCarry heavy stones until you can lift no more . . . then get stronger so you can lift \nheavier stones. \nThis mindless prescription leads Azur to a lifetime of toil. He never finishes \nhis pyramid promised to Pharaoh simply because he decides to do the heavy lift -\ning himself when he should have focused on a system to do it for him. Azur has a \nheart attack and dies while on the 12th level of his pyramid, just two levels from \nfinishing. He never experiences the great riches promised by Pharaoh. \nMeanwhile, Chuma retires 40 years early in a crown of luxury. Sloshing in \nfree time, Chuma goes on to become Egypt’s greatest scholar and an accomplished \ninventor. He is entombed alongside Pharaoh in the same pyramid he built.\nThe Fas TLane i s a b usiness s ys Tem: The sL ow Lane i s a Job\nThe Slowlane is a job: your hard work traded for your employer’s cash. Azur’s \nstruggles resemble that of a Slowlaner; to get rich, you’re told to get stronger (spend \nmoney, return to school, and earn more in the job market) so you can lift heavier\n\f\n115\npART 5 — weAlTh: The fAsTlAne RoAdmApstones.

In the Slowlane, \nyou are the source of heavy lifting, while in the Fastlane, you construct a system \nthat does it for you. \nOn your wealth road trip, the Slowlane roadmap asks that you endure a long, \ntiresome walk to wealth.

You need to be a visionary and a creator. You need to give birth to a \nbusiness and offer the world value . While the centrist theme to the Slowlane is a \njob, in the Fastlane, it’s a business . Yes, good old self-employment. I know, not \nbreaking news for “get rich” books, however, it’s important to note that most small \nbusiness owners are light years away from a Fastlane and dickering with Slowlane \nmetrics. Some businesses masquerade as jobs!\nA Fastlane business is the key to the Fastlane wealth equation (Wealth = Profit \n+ Asset Value) because it unlocks LEVERAGE, a new set of wealth variables that are \nunlimited and controllable, whereas in the Slowlane, they are limited and uncon-\ntrollable. Yes, ULL is swapped for CUL.\nFor example, the sale of this book extricates me from the Slowlane wealth \nequation and its universe. This book puts me into the Fastlane universe, which is \ngoverned by its wealth equation of net profit  and asset value . This book is a \nbusiness system that has unlimited leverage in both time and money! \nFirst, it survives time and it is capable of earning income long after my original \ntime investment. This book effectively transfers the act of income generation from \nme (the human asset) to the book (the business asset). \nFrom start to finish, this book cost roughly 1,000 hours of my time. If I sell \n100,000 books at $5 profit each, I earn $500,000, or roughly $500 per hour \ninvested. If I sell 500,000 books, I will earn $2,500 per hour invested. The more \nI sell, the greater the return on my original time investment, as I already paid the \ntime. Imagine 10 years from today I sell one copy of this book. Suddenly I earn $5 \nfrom a time investment I made years ago!\nBut it gets better! If I guest-speak on a radio show for 10 minutes and that \nappearance yields 1,000 book sales, this 10-minute investment yields $5,000 in \nincome (1,000 books × $5 profit) and yields a return on my time at $30,000 per \nhour. Can you get rich trading your time for $30,000 per hour? Yes you can, and \nawfully fast.\nYou see, when you unlock yourself from the handcuffs of time imposed by the \nSlowlane roadmap, you assign income to a system that leverages unlimited math-\nematics, and fast wealth becomes possible.

When I prompt for a guess, the answers are typical: Athlete. \nActor. A spoiled brat indulged by rich parents. A lottery winner. These speculative \n“answers” unmask the reality behind people’s perceptions: To get rich you have to \nget famous, inherit money , or win money. That’s what I thought, until I met that \nstranger in his Lamborghini so many years ago. \nThe Fas TLane w eaLTh e qua Tion\nLiving wealthy in youthful exuberance has to shatter the myth of “Get Rich Quick.” \nIf you’re 30 years old and worth millions, and you aren’t famous or rich via inheri -\ntance, you dirty all fabrics of normality. We can’t have that, now can we? Once \nagain, the secret is unmasked in the universal language of mathematics. The secret \nis to divorce yourself from the ugly and obese Slowlane equation (ULL) and trade \nup to the smoking hot blonde—the Fastlane equation ( CUL).\nWealth = Net Profit + Asset Value\nUnderneath this equation lies the true power of the Fastlane and how to build \nwealth fast. Its variables are controllable and unlimited. If you can control the\n\f\n121\npART 5 — weAlTh: The fAsTlAne RoAdmApvariables inherent to your wealth equation, you can get wealthy. Those variables \nare: \nNet Profit = Units Sold × Unit Profit\n~ and ~\nAsset Value = Net Profit × Industry Multiple\nAll business owners leverage this equation, in which [units sold] × [unit profit] \nwill determine net profit. Using my Internet company as an example, my unit \nprofit was approximately $4 for every Web site conversion. (A conversion was a \nuser who generated a lead). On any given day, I had 12,000 people visiting my \nWeb site. This means my “units sold” variable had an upper threshold of 12,000 \nper day. I had the opportunity to “sell” 12,000 people per day. \nLet’s compare this variable to the Slowlane’s counterpart of hours worked. \nUnder my wealth equation, my upper limit of wealth is “units sold” and currently \nstood at 12,000. Of course, 100% conversion is unreasonable, and “converting” \nall 12,000 is unlikely. Likewise, in the Slowlane, the unreasonable upper limit is \n24 because there are only 24 hours in the day. Logically, the real upper limit is 8 \nto 12 hours per day. \nWhat is going to make you rich? An upper limit of exposure to 12,000 people \nper day? Or maximizing your hours worked in the day? That’s 12,000 vs. 24. No \ncontest. I get rich and the Slowlaner gets old.\nControllable unlimited variables will make you rich. So how did I control this \nvariable? How is it unlimited? Simple. My average conversion ratio was 12%. If \nI want to make more profit, I don’t walk into the boss’s office and ask for a raise. \nNo, I have several weapons available for deployment.\n1) r aise units sold by increasing c onversion r atio\n A 1% increase from 12% to 13% would give me an instant raise of about $480 \nper day. That’s $14,400 per month. If I redesign the Web site, hit a home run \nand get conversion to 15%, now I’ve expanded my income to over $43,000 PER \nMONTH. \n2) r aise units sold by increasing web Traffic\n To raise profit, I can increase traffic. If I increase Web users to my Web site \nfrom 12,000 to 15,000 and conversion stays at 12%, my daily income rises by \n$1,440 per day, or $43,200 per month! Not likely? It happened! On some days \nI would have traffic spikes where over 20,000 users would visit.\n3) r aise unit Profit\n If I detect a weakness in supply for my service or improve value, I can raise \nprices and increase my unit profit. If my unit profit moves from $4 to $4.50,\n\f\n122\nthe millionaire fastlane I raise my income to $10,800 per day from $8,000. That translates to an addi -\ntional $84,000 per month! Is your mouth on the floor yet? \nIsn’t it wonderful to have control? These were my options to create wealth. I had \nreasonable control over both variables, “unit profit” and “units sold,” whereas in \nthe Slowlane you’re left pleading with the boss for a measly 3% salary raise. \nSecond, notice how my wealth variables are virtually unlimited. I controlled \nonly a small part of my market, and conceivably my upper threshold of traf -\nfic wasn’t the current 12,000 people but upward of 50,000–100,000 users PER \nDAY. Unit profit is also pliable. I could experiment with increased prices or new \nservices. \nI remember the time when I introduced a new service that cost me nothing \nand I sent out an email to my advertisers outlining the program. Within minutes, \nI made a few thousand dollars in reoccurring yearly income. My invested time \nwas negligible and the results were accumulative.\nHigh speed limit = high potential income. The power of this example is to \nillustrate why I got rich and most others don’t. I changed my universe because my \nwealth equation was unlimited and controllable. When I make tiny, incremental \nchanges in my strategy, I explode my income. A mere 1% increase in the variables \ncould mean thousands and a new Lamborghini. When your wealth variables have \nhigh leverage, so does your income potential—or would you rather stick with the \nceiling of 24 hours native to intrinsic value?\nUnfortunately, many enthusiastic business owners engage in opportunities with \nlow, punitive speeds. For example, if you sit outside the hardware store and sell \nhot dogs from your hot dog cart, you’ve muzzled your speed with no accelerative \nleverage. The variables are limited because your reach is confined to a small area. \nHow many hot dogs could you conceivably sell in the day? 40? 100? Is it possible \nyou can go home and rave to your wife “Honey! I sold 20,000 hot dogs today!” It \nwould never happen! Again, this isn’t much different from the 24-hour cage on \nintrinsic value. Small numbers have a strong gravity toward mediocrity.\nAnother example is this book itself. How many people are interested in finan -\ncial independence or early retirement? My market, my upper speed limit, is virtu-\nally hundreds of millions of people all over the world. To weaponize the Fastlane \nwealth equation, you must engage in a Fastlane business that has the potential for \nleverage or high speed limits.

Don’t be.\nThe primary wealth accelerant of the rich boils down to one concept: Appreciable \nand controllable assets. Within our Fastlane wealth equation, this second compo -\nnent is called “Asset Value.” Asset value is simply the worth of any property you \nown that has marketplace value. \nSlowlaners and Fastlaners have two antagonistic views of “assets.” Slowlaners \nand Sidewalkers buy and sell depreciating assets that decline in value over time. \nCars, boats, electronics, designer clothes, gizmodos, and sparkly bling to impress \nthat newly divorced woman in the adjacent cubicle—these are all assets that lose \nvalue the moment your credit card is charged. \nContrary to this, Fastlaners buy and sell appreciating assets: businesses, brands, \ncash flows, notes, intellectual property, licenses, inventions, patents, and real estate. \nAs it relates to the Fastlane wealth equation, the power of “Asset Value” lies in your \nability to control the variable in a virtually limitless fashion. \nw eaLTh a cceL era Tion by a sse T Va Lue\nThe rich accelerate wealth by accelerating asset value and selling those upgraded \nassets in the marketplace.\nTwenty-four-year-old Sheila Hinton quits her job to become a roving \ncomputer technician, eradicating viruses and cleaning computers. At first, \nher business operates in the local metropolitan area, but growth forces her \nto hire additional technicians. Her growth to additional cities is explosive \nand driven by demand. In a few years, Sheila owns a company that oper -\nates in 27 states. She moves from a technician to a facilitator of the system, \nand her company enjoys an impressive $2.9 million profit. After enjoying \nthe profits (and saving most of it), she sells her company for $24 million to a \nlarge computer manufacturer. She built an asset from nothing to something. \nThe asset was her system, and now with a $30 million nest egg, she never \nhas to work again.\nThe preceding story best represents the two variables that comprise “asset \nvalue”:\nAsset Value = (Net Profit) × (Industry Multiplier)\nAny time you have an asset that has sustainable profits, an industry multiplier \ngoverned by prevailing market conditions determines the valuation of that asset.\n\f\n124\nthe millionaire fastlane Other people or companies will buy that asset based on the asset’s net profit mul-\ntiplied by the assessed multiple. \nFor example, if you own a manufacturing company that nets $100,000 and \nthe average multiple for your industry is 6, your asset value is worth $600,000. \nIndustry multipliers are subject to intense negotiating as they rise and fall with \nthe economy and within industry sectors. \nYou already might be familiar with “multipliers.” Stocks trading on the public \nmarkets define the multiplier for each respective company by the price-to-earnings \nratio, or PE. If a company’s stock trades at 10 times PE , investors are purchasing \nthat company at a multiple of 10 times. Price-to-earnings is relevant regardless \nof whether your company is a small private company or a large publicly traded \ncompany: The valuation of your company is predicated on the subjective PE for your \nparticular industry.\nFor example, in my particular Web space, industry multipliers ranged from 2 \nto 6. For this analysis, let’s use the middle: 4. This means that any time I increased \nmy net profit, the value of my business increased by a minimum factor of 4 , or 400 % . \n400%! Where can you get a return of 400% in today’s financial market? Are there \nany mutual funds paying 400%? Forget about today, how about ever? \nIn effect, this puts a phenomenal wealth-building tool at your disposal. Since net \nincome, profit, or earnings can determine asset value, I experienced asset growth \nof 400% every time I increased net profit. For every dollar I earned, the value \nof my company would increase by a factor of 4, or $4.

You estimate that your \ntotal market (potential buyers) for your medical product(s) is 16 million. According \nto our chart above, the average multiple for the “medical devices” industry is over \n17. This means within your scope of wealth acceleration, you can accelerate wealth \nat a FACTOR of 17, or 1,700%. Your Wealth Acceleration Factor (WAF)  is 1,700%.\nLet’s extend this example further. For the next six years, you grow this com -\npany to the point that its net income is $1.2 million per year. This means you \nnow earn $100,000 per month (your net profit) AND  your company (the asset) is \nnow worth in the neighborhood of $18.4 million based on the average multiple \n($1 .2 MM × 17.32 multiple). You could continue to grow the business (grow wealth \nvia asset value) and cash flow (grow income) or seek to liquidate (sell asset value) \nto realize wealth acceleration.\nContrast the two wealth acceleration options for the Slowlaner and the Fastlaner. \nYour wealth acceleration options if you stay as an employed engineer:\n1) Raise your intrinsic value and HOPE the boss gives you a pay raise.\n2) HOPE the company doesn’t lay you off, so you can continue receiving your \nincome.\n3) Save 10% of your paycheck in a mutual fund and HOPE  for an 8% return for \nthe next 40 years.\nYour wealth acceleration options if you owned your own medical device \ncompany:\n1)  Grow net income with an income potential only limited by the number of \ndevices you can sell, that is, 16 million.\n2) Grow asset value at a factor of 1,700%.\n3) Liquidate asset value and turn paper money into real money.\nCan you see now why some 30-year-olds are worth $50 million and some are \nworth $13,000? The Fastlane universe operates on gains of 1,700% and millions, \nwhile the Slowlane universe 8% and 40. One plan is about HOPE  while the other \nis about CONTROL.

Then, \nsubsequently, and after profiting millions passively, I put the company up for sale \nand entertained multimillion dollar offers. I bought an asset for $250,000, appre -\nciated and manipulated the variables, and then sold it for millions.

It is the only coin you have,  \nand only you can determine how it will be spent.  \nBe careful, lest you let other people spend it for you.\n~ Carl Sandburg\nindus TriaL izing w eaLT h: d iVorce F rom Time\nMy first Fastlane taste was in my late 20s, when I had one of the worst months of \nmy life: A brutal mix of a bad relationship gone south and some troubling health \nnews served as a lethal cocktail to my business productivity. I spent most of the \nmonth in bed with the shades drawn, watching Judge Judy unleash a firestorm of \ncommon-sense whoop-ass. During this troubling time I had to cash in my Fastlane \nlottery ticket—and let me tell you, it paid. \nDespite being “checked out” on life, my income actually grew. Yes, grew. My \nincome didn’t stop because I stopped. How did I get so lucky? I was divorced from \ntime. Years earlier, I broke the chains of “my time for money.” This allowed me \nto escape the stranglehold of the Slowlane equation and operate on the Fastlane \nplaying field. \nWhen your wealth is predicated on factors that you cannot control and that \nare implicitly limited, you aren’t going to make fast progress. You aren’t in control, \nbecause time is in control. You aren’t in control, because the boss is in control. You \naren’t in control, because the stock market is in control. How did I escape these \ncontrols that society finds perfectly acceptable? Instead of trading my time for \nmoney (manual labor), I traded it into a business system—industrialized wealth \nproduction. \nIn my situation, time was working for me, not against me. My business system \nearned money with the passage of time, and yet was exclusive of my time . It was a\n\f\n129\npART 5 — weAlTh: The fAsTlAne RoAdmApvirtual money tree and it didn’t care what I was doing. Whether I was watching \nJerry Springer or jet skiing in Jamaica, the system was built to be its own machine—a \nliving, breathing entity that did the dirty work for me. My system was a surrogate \nand traded its time. I owned my time instead of time owning me.\nPassi Ve income: The h o Ly g rai L To r eTiremen T\nThe buzzword in moneymaking circles is “passive income”—earning income \nwhile not working. While retired, I receive checks every month like clockwork \nand I don’t lift a finger. Passive income is a successful divorce from the “work-\nfor-money” equation indigenous to the Slowlane. The beauty of passive income is \nit doesn’t care if you’re 20 years old or 80. If your monthly income exceeds your \nlifestyle expenses including taxes, guess what? You’re retired!\nThe Fastlane Roadmap is engineered for two purposes. It’s engineered to create \na passive income stream to the excess of your expenses and lifestyle desires, and \nto make financial freedom a reality, exclusive of age.\nTo b reak Time i s To g row a m oney Tree\nMom convinced me it was true. “We can’t afford that, do you think money grows \non trees?” She was wrong. Money grows on trees if you own a money tree. And, you \ncan own one if you know how and where to get the seeds. Money trees are business \nsystems that survive on their own. They require periodic support and nurturing \nbut survive on their own, creating a surrogate for your time-for-money trade. \nA few years ago, I was in Vegas and I lost nearly $2,000 gambling. After retreat -\ning to my hotel room with my tail between my legs, I realized, why fret? I lost $2,000. \nOn that day, my money tree, my Internet company I created, earned $6,000. While \nI gambled (or slept, swam, or ate) my blooming money tree bore fruit.\nA money tree is a business system, and it’s the Fastlane roadmap’s Main Street. \nMoney trees create passive income streams BEFORE you “officially” retire. Yes, \nyou can experience the destination of retirement and financial freedom without \nactually being retired. This is akin to taking a vacation to the South Pacific and \nmagically bypassing the nine-hour plane ride.\nmoney Tree s eedLings: a Fas TLane b usiness\nNot all businesses are Fastlane, and many of them can’t be transformed into money \ntrees.

Her profit margins, slim \nand softened by franchise royalties, don’t allow her to hire an operator to \nrun the restaurant in her place. She feels trapped as she trades her time for \ndollars. Although she earns a $90,000-a-year profit in her business, Jillian \nhas no free time to enjoy the fruits of her labor. She could pay $60,000 to \na general manager, which would give her free time. Knowing she can’t sur-\nvive on $30,000 per year, she feels trapped to her business while her profit is \ncornered into submission.

It is the old way and still very much a road to wealth. For example, \nI own a single-family rental home with a great tenant. I could be living on the \nmoon and each month I get a check in the mail because my time is detached from \nits income. Real estate is a perfect example of Wealth 1.0 because real estate is its \nown system. It is 95% passive. As time passes, tenants pay landlords to use their \nproperty. From single families to apartment buildings to massive commercial \noffice buildings, real estate has always been the default choice for seedling money \ntrees. Furthermore, real estate is an asset that can be manipulated and its value \nappreciated. Appreciative assets (asset value) are cornerstones in the Fastlane \nwealth equation.\n\f\n131\npART 5 — weAlTh: The fAsTlAne RoAdmApDon’t want to get involved in real estate? No problem. Rental systems aren’t just \nreserved for real estate. Rental systems can come from a variety of other sources \nnot real estate oriented. Leases, royalty payments, and licensing are other forms \nof “rental systems” that can produce reoccurring monthly income. For example, \nwhen you own the rights to a music collection, corporations have to pay you a \nroyalty to use the music. The work might have been recorded decades earlier, but \nit still generates royalties. \nLikewise, if you invent and patent a product process and license it to other \ncompanies, you again earn income from the licensing fee. The patent was invented \nand registered, yet its income survives time exclusive of your time. Photographers \ncan earn licensing revenues by allowing others to use their photos. Cartoonists \nlicense their artistry to book authors and newspaper producers. The creation of a \ncartoon might have happened years ago, yet, it survives time and generates rental \nincome for the owner. Rental systems are powerful money trees because they are \nhigh on the passivity scale and survive time.\nseedling 2: c omputer/software s ystems (Passivity g rade: a -)\nMy preferred system is computer and software systems, including the Internet. \nIt’s no shock that the Internet has paved the road to millions more than any other \nroad out there. In fact, I heard a statistic that the Internet created more million -\naires in the last five years than the previous five decades combined. What makes \nthe Internet and computer systems so potent?\nComputers are miraculous inventions and fertile seeds to money trees. They \nwork 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and they don’t bitch about working condi -\ntions. They don’t bitch that you don’t pay them enough. They don’t bitch and moan \nabout co-workers like Lazy Joan or Same-Shirt Bob. Nope, computers aren’t late, \nthey don’t ask for pay raises, and they don’t care you just bought a new Mercedes \nS-Class. Nope, they just do what they’re programmed to do and it’s done.\nWhat sets the Internet apart from real estate is it implicitly contains leverage. \nWhen you own a Web site, you’re accessible to millions. When you own a three-\nbedroom home on Elm Street, it’s accessible to a few. This duality makes Internet \nsystems one of the best business seedlings in existence. \nAdditionally, computer systems aren’t limited to the Internet. It could be \nsoftware or applications. Some of the richest people on the planet are software \nbillionaires, like Bill Gates of Microsoft and Larry Ellison of Oracle. Software \nenjoys plump margins because it is easily replicated. Once the code is written, it’s \ndone. You can easily sell one or 10,000. Can you replicate an office building with \nease? You can’t. \nSoftware millionaires can be “average Joes.” Facebook and iPhone applica -\ntion developers are making money fast. One iPhone developer, Nicholas, raked \nin $600,000 in a single month with a single iPhone game. In a phone interview,\n\f\n132\nthe millionaire fastlane Nicholas said that he wouldn’t be shocked if he became a millionaire by year’s \nend. Wow. One day Nicholas is treading the Slowlane at his nice cushy job and \npopping a few Benjamins into his 401 K, when suddenly he finds himself smack \nin the middle of a Fastlane. Of course, the road to the Fastlane wasn’t easy for \nNicholas. An engineer at Sun Micro Systems, he worked on his application after \nworking eight-hour days, cradling his one-year-old son in one hand and coding \nwith the other. How did he learn how to code an iPhone app? Nicholas couldn’t \nafford books so he taught himself by scouring websites. Hmmm . . . do you smell \nprocess behind the event?\nSoftware, when tapped into potent distribution, can be replicated to millions. \nIt scales without significant degradation to passivity. \nseedling 3: c ontent s ystems (Passivity g rade: b+)\nContent systems are systems of information. That information can be fused to a \nvariety of other systems, like the Internet and physical distribution systems. This \nbook is a content system that I can effectively move through other channels, like \nthe Internet or a book distributor. \nIn the old days of wealth, striking it rich via content meant you had to be a \nnewspaper mogul, magazine publisher, or successful author. Control the press. \nDistribute content. Information, like software, often has ease of replication. I can \nprint 10 million of these books. I will never own 10 million pieces of real estate, \nnor do I have any desire. Like their software counterparts, some of the richest \npeople on the planet are successful authors. \nIn a few short years, JK Rowling, author and owner of the Harry Potter brand, \nwent from being a 32-year-old divorced English teacher to a media mogul worth \nover $400 million. The single mom has sold over 30 million copies of her books \nin 35 different languages. I guess she didn’t hear the excuse, “I’m a single mom \nand I don’t have time.” Ms. Rowling recalls the happiest point of her life—not the \nacquisition of millions, but the point at which she could write full-time.\nSimilarly, Dan Brown has sold over 80 million copies of the DaVinci Code  in \n51 languages. Let me be perfectly clear: If you sell 80 million of ANYTHING , you \nwill be a very rich human being. \nThe latest trend of content distribution has merged with computer systems. \nBlogs, social networks, e-books, and online magazines all serve the newest hybrid \nof computers systems and content distribution. In fact, this new combination is so \npowerful that it is driving many of the old, hard-line models out of business. Paper \nnewspapers and magazines are officially endangered to be extinct in the coming \ndecade. Change creates millionaires . Those who observe and take advantage of \nchange will be the new millionaires and billionaires.\nContent also survives time. This book might have taken me years to write, but \nit also survives years. If someone buys this book five years from now, I will earn a\n\f\n133\npART 5 — weAlTh: The fAsTlAne RoAdmApsmall profit on a time investment I made years earlier. The content is an asset that \nis salable, over and over again, and with each sale, the effective time cost declines \nwhile the hourly rate of return expands.\nseedling 4: d istribution s ystems (Passivity g rade: b)\nA distribution system is any structure or organization designed to move products \nto the masses. Distribution systems can be hybrids with the other seedlings, such \nas content and computer systems. \nIf you invent and manufacture a new product and sell it on QVC, you are lever-\naging a distribution system. If you sell that product via infomercial at 2 a.m., you \nare leveraging a distribution system. If you sell your product to four wholesale \ndistributors that, in turn, sell it to retailers like Wal-Mart and Target, you are \nleveraging a distribution system. \nWhen inventing any product, the invention is always half the battle. Distribution \nis the other. The greatest product in the world goes unused if it isn’t leveraged into \nthe proper distribution system—either one that exists, or one that you create.\nAmazon.com is one example of a distribution system that I use. This book \nsells on Amazon and is available to millions. However, a book sitting on Amazon \nrepresents unrealized potential, like a 1,000 horsepower car sitting in the garage. \nIt is my job to turn the engine on and drive the power of the distribution system. \nThe tool exists, ready to be exploited by successful (or failed) execution.\nOur iPhone developer leveraged the iPhone “App Store” to move his software. This \nwas his distribution point. Without the distribution, he couldn’t sell software. \nDistribution is a means to move product to the masses. Some systems are bet -\nter than others and when it comes to distribution, it all depends on the control \nstructure. If you create  a network marketing company to sell your new vitamin \nproduct, you are creating a powerful distribution network capable of earning \nmillions. If you join  a network marketing company, you are electing to be a gear \nin the distribution process.\nAnother potent form of distribution is franchising and/or chaining. When a \nsuccessful store concept is branded and systemized, it can be replicated and sold to \nother individuals. Savvy Fastlane entrepreneurs recognize that a successful local \nbusiness with weak leverage can be made highly leveraged by franchises or chains. \nDoes this path sound familiar? It should; this is what Starbucks did to become the \nbiggest coffee chain in the world. \nOther restaurants deploy a combination of chains and franchises. Dairy Queen \nand McDonalds have both chains and franchises. If your business operates in \nlimited scale, it can be conquered with chains and franchises. If you own one \nhot-dog cart and sell at one location, there is no leverage. If you own 500 hot-dog \ncarts and sell at 500 locations through 500 owner-operators, suddenly leverage \nappears. The Fastlane wealth equation has power."

Local travelers to the Phoenix airport could valet-park their car in \na neighboring parking lot and get chauffeured to the airport. In general, this was a \nrental system. People would pay to park their car and I would earn a daily fee for \neach parked car. It had Internet-like qualities; it ran 24/7 and generated income \nwith the simple passage of time. It was great idea with high potential for passivity. \nI found land for sale near the airport and it was perfect. I started to run numbers, \nprojections, and scenarios to see how I could make this business a reality. \nThe numbers uncovered something important. While the business model was \ntruly a “rental system,” the operation itself was a “human resource system.” To \nmake this idea a successful business, it would have required at least two-dozen \npeople on payroll at all times. That stopped me cold and I didn’t pursue it fur -\nther. I wasn’t willing to risk trading passivity for a human resource system that is \nunpredictable and difficult to manage. \nA member of the Fastlane community owns a few self-storage facilities. Her \nbusiness is a rental system. People pay money to store their junk and she receives \nmonthly income. You’d assume that her facility is run by a human resource system—\nmanagers, property assistants—but it isn’t. Her properties have automated kiosks \nthat run each property—a computer system. This makes her business 85% passive. \nRemove the kiosk, add human resource systems, and passivity drops.\nDoes this suggest that human resource systems are a drain to passivity? It \ndepends. First, what is the existing level of passivity to the business as it is now? \nIf you own a coffee shop and work 80 hours a week, you have ZERO  passivity. A \ngeneral manger—a human resource system—would raise passivity by an estimated\n\f\n135\npART 5 — weAlTh: The fAsTlAne RoAdmAp40%. In my business, I was operating at 85% passivity. Adding any human resource \nsystem would have lowered passivity. \nHuman resource systems can add passivity or erode it. Good employees nurture \nmoney trees. Bad employees pluck the fruit of money trees and require pruning. \nHowever don’t let that scare you. If you want to make millions of dollars, or billions, \nhuman resource systems are needed, because you can’t do everything yourself.\nc ha PTer s ummary: Fas TLane d is Tinc Tions\n • To divorce yourself from the Slowlane’s transactional relationship of “time for \nmoney,” you need to become a producer, specifically, a business owner.\n • Business systems break the bond between “your time for money” because they \nact like surrogate operatives for your time trade.\n • If you have a passive income that exceeds all your needs and lifestyle expenses \nincluding taxes, you’re retired.\n • Retirement can happen at any age.\n • The fruit from a money tree is passive income.\n • A Fastlane objective is to create a business system that survives time, exclusive \nof your time. \n • The 5 money-tree seedlings are rental systems, computer systems, content sys -\ntems, distribution systems, and human-resource systems.\n • Real estate, licenses, and patents are examples of rental systems.\n • Internet and software businesses are examples of computer systems.\n • Authoring books, blogging, and magazines are forms of content systems. \n • Franchising, chaining, network marketing, and television marketing are \nexamples of distribution systems.\n • Human resource systems can add or subtract to passivity.\n • Human resource systems are the most expensive to manage and implement."

The best money tree in \nexistence sits right in your pocketbook: The good old-fashioned buck. Yes, money. \nMoney is the king of money trees. \nHow is money passive? If you have a lot of money, you’re given the gate key to \nswitch teams from consumer to producer. Specifically, you move from borrower \nto lender. You move from employee to employer. You move from customer to \nowner. In other words, people pay you to use YOUR MONEY in the form of inter -\nest or ownership.\nFor example, let’s examine interest, which is a fee earned to lend money. Right \nnow you’re probably someone who doesn’t earn interest, but pays it. Someone lent \nyou money for the mortgage on your home, and in return you pay the note-holder \ninterest. That interest is profit or income to someone else. \nWhile the act of becoming a lender sounds complicated, it isn’t. Anytime you \nbuy a certificate of deposit from a bank, you become a lender. Anytime you buy \na municipal bond, either directly from the source or indirectly via mutual fund, \nyou become a lender. When you deposit money in the bank, you become a lender. \nAs a lender, you don’t administer the loans; you just sit back and collect checks. \nIt’s super easy and super passive. Gary, my rich limousine passenger, was a lender \nwho never had to work another day in his life.\nsaVers b ecome Lenders, o wners, and Producers\nI heard a radio commercial the other day from a self-proclaimed “Double-Dad” \nguru who declared: “Savers are losers!” I couldn’t believe my ears. Savers are losers? \nAnd who are the winners? The people you advised to borrow millions on risky real \nestate investments? Savers aren’t losers. Savers are winners because they eventually \nbecome lenders. Savers are winners because they become owners in companies. \nSavers are winners because they become producers and build assets.\nOpen your wallet and look at a dollar. One buck. It doesn’t buy much but it is \nthe embryonic start to a passive income stream. One dollar has the power to give \nyou a nickel of passive income for life. Yes, for life. While one nickel buys squat, it \nunlocks the DNA implicit in money—it’s fully passive.\nI retired in my thirties because of this simple reality. I’m a lender, and when you \nhave a lot of money to lend, you live free because passive income arrives every month. \nIf you had $10 million and lent it at a mere 5% interest, you’d enjoy a passive income \nof $41,666 every single month . At 8% your monthly income would be $66,666 per \nmonth—fully passive. Over $60,000 every month! This is WITHOUT  touching the \nprincipal. You can do this for years and still have 10 million dollars left over! \nImagine opening your mailbox every month to a $40,000 check—and you \ndidn’t have to do anything for it. What kind of trouble can you get into earning \n$40,000 per month? I bet a lot. Unrealistic? It isn’t. This is how I live. Even in this\n\f\n138\nthe millionaire fastlane low-interest-rate environment I can find safe investment yields in the 4%–6% \nrange, some tax-free. While most people shudder at the thought of an interest rate \nincrease, I love it. I get a pay raise. A 1% interest rate hike translates into thou -\nsands per month for me. And since inflation rises in unison with interest rates, my \nincome has an element of inflation protection. If inflation rises, so do interest rates.\nSo how does all of this become a reality? I created a passive income stream via \nmy Internet businesses (a business money tree seedling), which funded my passive \nincome system from lending. While my Internet business was 85% passive (yes, \nI had to work several hours per week), my lending passivity is 99.5%. I do virtually \nnothing and the checks arrive. \nInstead of trading my time for dollars, I invested my time into an autonomous \nsystem simultaneously capable of passivity and capable of funding my money sys -\ntem. It was a dual-flanked attack where passive income was both the short and \nlong term goal. \na mass y our a rmy o F Freedom Figh Ters \nEvery dollar saved is another freedom fighter in your army. If your money is fight-\ning for you, your time is freed and you break the equation of “time for money.”\nMoney is your army. The more you have, the more they will fight for freedom. \nSlowlaners focus on the expense variable in the wealth equation when they should \nbe focused on the income variable. Income is the key to growing your army of \nfreedom fighters. You aren’t going to recruit a massive army detailing cars down \nat the Jimmy’s Auto Salon. \nAnd I’m not referring to just the U.S. dollar, but all international dollar-denom-\ninated assets. As I write this, much of my income is derived from non-U.S.-dollar \nassets in other countries with stronger currencies and better yields. Fastlaners \nthink globally, not locally.\nWhat does a dollar represent to you? A mechanism that gets you bottle service \nat the club every Friday? Or is it the seed of your money tree? Is it your freedom \nfighter? Make money fight for you instead of you fighting for money. \nh ow Fas TLaners ( The r ich) u se c om Pound i n Teres T\nWhile examining the Slowlane, I impugned “compound interest” as an impotent \nwealth accelerator because of its attachment to time. When the Slowlane media \ndarlings read that assertion I’ll be crucified because lambasting compound interest \nis the pinnacle of financial blasphemy. But I also exclaimed it to be a powerful pas-\nsive income generator when leveraged against large sums of money. Contradictory? \nJust like education, Fastlaners and Slowlaners leverage compound interest differ -\nently. Slowlaners (the middle-class) use compound interest to get wealthy while \nFastlaners (the rich) use it to create income and liquidity. Slowlaners start with $5; \nFastlaners start with $5 million.\n\f\n139\npART 5 — weAlTh: The fAsTlAne RoAdmApCompound interest pays my bills. It’s my tool. It’s my passive income source. \nYet, compound interest is not responsible for my wealth. This is critical. Fastlaners \naren’t using compound interest to build wealth, because it’s not in their wealth \nequation. The heavy lifting of wealth creation is left to their Fastlane business.\nWhen a rich politician or public figure comes forth and discloses his finances, \nnotice the common themes. The source of their wealth comes from their business \ninterests, while their liquid cash reserves are tied into fixed-income securities like \nmunicipal bonds, treasuries, and other highly liquid and safe investments. The rich \naren’t using the markets to create wealth; they’re increasing their existing wealth \nwith leveraged business assets . Remember, that 25-year-old multimillionaire who \ngot rich investing in mutual funds is a fairy tale. The millionaires are the guys \nrunning the funds! They’re the producers! \nh ow To r eaLLy u se c om Pound i n Teres T\nWould you rather have $5 million right now, or a penny doubled every day for \nforty days? No-brainer, right? You’d take the $5 million bucks. But that would be \na serious mistake. Accept $5 million now and you forsake nearly $5,500,000,000. \nThat’s $5 .5 BILLION  dollars. Examine the chart below that demonstrates the force \nof doubling.\n\f\n140\nthe millionaire fastlane Now transform the previous chart and replace the days with YEARS . Make \nday-one a person—you—at 21 years old. \nThe transformed chart is indicative of a Slowlaner’s journey where compound \ninterest doesn’t enforce power until most of life has evaporated. Big money doesn’t \ncome until you are in your fifties and sixties, and this is with 100% returns year \nafter year. Average market returns would be 7%. Yet at a doubling, at age 40 you \nhave barely six grand. Again, this is the Slowlaner’s predicament: Imprisoned in \ntime and uncontrollable yield.\nFastlaners understand this weakness and realize that compound interest \nweapon is most effective with large sums of money. For compound interest to be \neffective, you must bypass 30 years of mathematical ineptitude by riding the crest \nwhere it is effective.\nThe Tida L w aVe o F c om Pound i n Teres T\nLike a tidal wave far out to sea, compound interest’s strength isn’t visible until it \nmoves near land. As the wave approaches land, its force becomes incredibly pow-\nerful. Most Slowlaners ride the compound interest tidal wave a million miles out \nat sea. And guess what—nothing happens. They float aimlessly, going nowhere. \nTen percent interest on $5,000 doesn’t make millionaires. Saving $200 a month\n\f\n141\npART 5 — weAlTh: The fAsTlAne RoAdmApfrom your paycheck in a 3% savings account isn’t going to make you rich fast. You \nsimply can’t ride a wave miles out at sea. \nThe Fastlaner observes the tidal forces near land and seeks to meet it at the \nshore. At the shore, the tidal wave can be ridden with impact. To actuate compound \ninterest’s power, start at the shore, with a large number that can be leveraged. Ten \npercent interest on $10 million is $1 million a year—$83,333 every single month. \nExploit compound interest at its crest, not a million miles out to sea.\nThe point of this illustration is to show that the rich aren’t using compound \ninterest to get wealthy; they’re using it for income and liquidity. A 5% tax-free \nyield on $10 million suddenly creates a $500,000 per year passive income. Like a \ntidal wave at the seashore, compound interest rears excruciating force when pitted \nagainst large sums of money. This is where money transforms into a fully passive \nincome stream. As for earning your $10 million, that solution lies in exponential \nleveraged growth stemming from a Fastlane business—net income plus asset \nvalue— NOT in expenses, NOT in the stock market, and NOT in a job.\n\f\nc ha PTer s ummary: Fas TLane d is Tinc Tions\n • One saved dollar is the seed to a money tree.\n • A mere 5% interest on $10 million dollars is $40,000 a month in passive \nincome. \n • A saved dollar is the best passive income instrument.\n • Fastlaners (the rich) don’t use compound interest or the markets to get wealthy \nbut to create income and preserve liquidity.\n • A saved dollar is a freedom fighter added to your army. \n • The rich leverage compound interest at its crest, applied against large sums \nof money.\n • Fastlaners eventually become net lenders.\n\f\n143\n21\nThe Real Law of Wealth\nTry not to become a man of success, but a man of value.\n~ Albert Einstein\neFFec Tion, no T aTT rac Tion\nThe Law of Effection.

Math \nis law. “Secrets” and mystical philosophies are not. \nIf you want to get rich, start observing the true law of the universe— MATH—\nand not some hocus-pocus law that can neither be proved nor documented. \nSinging positive platitudes around the campfire isn’t going to make you rich. Oh, \ndon’t get your panties in a wad; I know the Law of Attraction sounds great and \nhas practical applications. \nFor those not familiar with The Law of Attraction (“L OA”), it’s a mystical phi-\nlosophy that states you become what you think and that your conscious and uncon-\nscious thoughts make your reality. The LOA contends that if you know exactly what \nyou want, ask the universe for it, see it coming, then you will eventually receive it. \nThink riches and you will have riches! Sounds easy, huh? \nI won’t hide my candid sacrilege to the LOA crowd; I think it’s a bunch of balo-\nney orchestrated to sell books to those who think “thinking” will make you rich. \nIn fact, the LOA is nothing but old principles of belief and visualization repack -\naged and remarketed for mass consumption. Who are the true Fastlaners? The \nLOA marketers!\n\f\n144\nthe millionaire fastlane bake a c ake w iThou T s ugar?\nWhy did this book take me so long to write?

I even snapped a picture of \na bookstore shelf and Photoshopped my book on the shelf. What happened? \nAbsolutely nothing. Nada. Zilch. The universe never gave me my finished book. \nThe fact is, despite all my positive thinking and meditations to the universe for \nmy book, it never materialized until I sat my butt down in a chair and started to \nwrite it. I made a coordinated commitment to ACTION, a conscious choice, and \nthen a commitment to that choice in the form of massive action. \nIf you’re a Law of Attraction fan and find this critique offensive, that’s OK;  \nI didn’t write The Millionaire Fastlane to make friends or to book speaking engage-\nments about being a positive thinker. I wrote it to tell you exactly what you need to \ndo to get rich. Thinking never made anyone rich, unless that thinking manifests \nitself into consistent action toward application of laws that work. \nIn fact, I find it insulting that someone might assume my success is due to \npositive thinking. I’m a realist who understands human nature, and that nature \nis to take the path of least resistance. It doesn’t surprise me that these “attraction” \nbooks sell millions.

The “Flaw of Attraction” is that it ignores mathematics.\nThe Law o F eFF ec Tion: The Fas TLane Primer\nThe Law of Effection states that the more lives you affect in an entity you control, in \nscale and/or magnitude, the richer you will become .

The amount of money you have (or don’t have) is a direct reflection \non the amount of value you have provided (or not provided).\neFFec Tion i s s ca Le, magni Tude, or b o Th\nTo exploit the Law of Effection, your business needs to make an impact of either \nscale or magnitude, or both. Within our Fastlane wealth equation, “scale” and \n“magnitude” are implicit to our “net profit” variable. \nNET PROFIT = Units Sold (Scale) × Unit Profit (Magnitude)\nAn example of SCALE is reflected on our Fastlane roadmap via the profit variable \nin our wealth equation: units sold. If you sell 20 million pens and make 75 cents \nprofit on each, you just earned $15 million. This is having an impact on SCALE  with \ntiny MAGNITUDE. Obviously, selling a writing pen doesn’t have a major impact on \nanyone’s life. The wealth is transmuted via SCALE, not magnitude.\nConversely, magnitude is having a great impact on a few and within our Fastlane \nwealth equation is reflected in UNIT PROFIT. Price always reflects magnitude. If \nyou sell a product that’s worth $50 million, you have access to magnitude. For \nexample, if you owned an apartment complex with 400 units and profit $100 from \neach unit, you’d generate $40,000 in monthly income. Because you are provid -\ning housing for 400 families, you are making an impact of magnitude, not scale. \nShelter has magnitude. Activities of magnitude have higher profit potential with \nsmaller scales. Magnitude is always reflected by an item’s price. High value = high \nprice = high magnitude.\nIf you can combine both scale and magnitude, we won’t be discussing millions \nbut billions. Donald Trump makes an impact on both magnitude and scale and \ntherefore is worth billions. \nScale creates millionaires. Magnitude creates millionaires. Scale and magnitude \ncreates billionaires.\nFoLL ow T he m oney!\nUnfortunately, the word “law” is loosely tossed around to represent concepts that \naren’t really laws. The Law of Attraction isn’t a law but a theory. The word “law” \nis absolute. It works 100% of the time. When you drop a watermelon from your \ntenth-floor dorm window, the Law of Gravity takes over—the watermelon falls to \nthe ground every single time. The outcome is a 100% certainty.\nUnfortunately, positive thinking and visualization don’t work with 100% cer -\ntainty. Belief and manifestation aren’t absolute so they can’t be classified as laws. \nHowever, the Law of Effection is absolute. \nShow me any self-made billionaire and I will show you a person who has touched\n\f\n146\nthe millionaire fastlane the lives of many in scale or magnitude, directly or indirectly. To Woodward and \nBernstein, Deep Throat said, “Follow the money,” and when you do, you find the \nonly one true law of wealth, and that is Effection. Why? Because Effection is rooted \nin mathematics, and because of this it operates exclusive of any roadmap.\nA Slowlaner can use the Law of Effection to escape Slowlane confinement. Pro \nathletes, actors, and entertainers—intrinsic value explosions happen because of the \neffection: Society suddenly perceives your value to be meteoric. Yes, these people \nare still trading their time for money, but in an unprecedented stratum of value. \nFor example, over the last decade, Bill Clinton earned more than $50 million \nin public speaking fees. While speaking is a direct trade of time for money, his \nintrinsic value is legendary, perhaps more than $100,000 per hour. Underneath \nthe big fee is the Law of Effection. He speaks to millions and is paid millions. \nA rapper sells millions of songs and is paid millions. A housewife sells a mil -\nlion kitchen gadgets and earns millions. A lottery winner wins millions because \nmillions entered the drawing. Daddy Warbuck’s son inherits millions because \nWarbucks Company served millions. A plastic surgeon earns millions because \nhe serves many in magnitude. A star athlete’s agent earns millions because his \nclients serve millions. Retrace the source of millionaire money and you will find \nmillions of something.\nEffection of scale or magnitude always precedes money, either directly or \nindirectly. The more lives you impact, directly or indirectly, the more wealth you \nwill attract. \nbig w eaLTh Fo LLows b ig n umbers \nAthletes are a perfect example of Effection. If you play professional baseball, you’re \npaid a meteoric intrinsic value. In 2009 Alex Rodriguez signed a $240 million \ncontract. How exactly is that justified? Simple. The Law of Effection justifies all \nwealth. Alex Rodriguez, via baseball, entertains millions. He leverages SCALE . \nThis is the same for any professional athlete. They get paid millions because they \nentertain millions. A comedian who makes millions laugh gets paid millions. \nThe corporate executive who facilitates a corporation that services millions gets \npaid millions. \nAgain, these are glorified power intrinsic-value positions that leverage the Law \nof Effection. If you want to get rich via intrinsic value, you must do it via the Law \nof Effection. Get into a position to impact millions. Become indispensable and \nirreplaceable like an athlete, entertainer, or a top-brass executive.\nCan’t get access to millions like an athlete? Then go directly to the source and \nserve the source. For example, agents of high-profile athletes are as rich as the \nathletes themselves because they have indirect contact to the Law of Effection. \nReal estate brokers who specialize in the homes of the rich become rich them -\nselves because they indirectly connect themselves to arbiters of the Law. The\n\f\n147\npART 5 — weAlTh: The fAsTlAne RoAdmApLaw of Effection doesn’t care about roadmaps or time trades or anything but the \nmathematical power of large numbers. Make a giant impact a few times or make \na small impact millions of times. \nJoe Magnitude owns a company that develops commercial real estate. \nHe develops 14 office complexes and partitions the offices into condos. Each \nfully sold complex profits him $400,000. 14 (scale) × $400,000 (magnitude) \nequals $5,600,000. \nJoe Scale writes a book detailing a diet of the stars. He sells 8 million cop -\nies (scale) and earns $7 per copy (magnitude). He earns the same amount: \n$5,600,000.\nThe closer you get to the source of large numbers, the closer you will get to \nwealth. To serve millions is to make millions. Think big to earn big.\nc ha PTer s ummary: Fas TLane d is Tinc Tions\n • The Law of Effection states that the more lives you affect or breach, both in \nscale or magnitude, the richer you will be.\n • Scale translates to “units sold” of our profit variable within our Fastlane wealth \nequation.

A good \nread, but fundamentally flawed.\nIf you aren’t familiar with “pay yourself first,” it’s a Slowlane doctrine that urges \nyou to save your money (pay yourself) before all else—food, gas, car payments, and \nother bills. This supposedly forces the Slowlaner’s savings rate to accelerate their \nputrid wealth acceleration vehicle: compound interest via market investments. \nThe fact is, advising a Slowlaner to “pay yourself first” is like advising a quad -\nriplegic to climb a flight of stairs. It’s futilely fruitless. If you have a job, examine \nyour last paycheck. Is your gross pay that same as your net pay? It isn’t and for \nsome, it may be as much as 35% less. Additionally, pre-tax saving weapons such \nas 401K’ s and IRA’s severely limit your contributions to infantile amounts where \ncreating wealth on a pre-tax basis in a job becomes organizationally penal.\nIf your primary income source comes from a job, your ability to pay yourself \nfirst is paralyzed because the governments are paid first! For “pay yourself first” \nto be legitimate, you truly need to pay yourself first in infinite amounts and the \ngovernment last. You must own your vehicle."

Your vehicle (you) must be \nfree and clear. When you have a job, someone owns you. And when someone owns \nyou, you aren’t paid first, but last. \nThe first step to controlling your vehicle—you—is to own yourself so you can \ntruly pay yourself first and the government last. That is accomplished by shelling \nyour business into a corporation that you control. \nThe corporation serves as the Fastlane frame because it offers the immediate \ntax benefit of “pay yourself first” versus “pay yourself last.” When you own a cor-\nporation, net profits are reduced by expenses. The remaining profit is taxed, and \nthose taxes are paid to the government. Additionally, corporations exist separate \nfrom their owners and survive time. It’s the surrogate structure that serves as your \nbusiness system.\nWhen you own a corporation, the government is paid four times a year, once \nevery quarter through estimated taxes. If you have a payroll, taxes are paid each \ntime you pay your employees. I pay myself first 365 times a year while the govern -\nment is paid four times a year. Doesn’t that sound like a structure that is conducive \nto not only “pay yourself first” but also wealth?\nh ow To o wn y ourse LF\nLike many entrepreneurs, I made the horrific mistake of getting into business as \na sole proprietor. Any “adviser” who recommends a business structure as a sole \nproprietorship or general partnership should be avoided like an airport toilet. \nThese entities are risky because they don’t protect you and catapult unlimited \nliability onto you and your personal assets. If you’re a plumber organized as a \nsole proprietor and you accidentally leave a pipe cutter at a client’s house and the \nclient’s three-year-old kills himself with it, guess what? They’re coming after you \nbecause you chose an ill-protected business entity. Instead of suing a corporation, \nthey sue you and everything you own is up for grabs. The best business structures \nfor your Fastlane business are:\n1)  C corporation\n2) S corporation \n3)  Limited liability corporation \nEach has its advantages and disadvantages, but all share two common benefits: \nlimitation of liability and tax efficiency."

    "raw_text": "153\npART 6 — youR vehicle To weAlTh: youThe c  c orporation\nThe C corporation is a business structure that survives time and can be easily \ntransferred. Corporate profits are taxed at corporate income tax rates, with net \nincome distributed to shareholders. \nSome C-corp owners use this structure to deploy a strategy known as “income \nsplitting.” The strategy is to partition the business’s income to both the owner and \nthe business, effectively lowering the tax bracket of the two, versus a large income \nfor just one. While it’s not within the scope of this book to dive into tax strategy and \ncorporate formation, it does offer up a Fastlane component, which is control. \nWhile C corporations and their owners are subject to double taxation (tax on \ncorporate profits and dividends to shareholders), they are advantageous for larger \ncorporations and corporations with an “asset growth” strategy. In other words, \nif you don’t plan on distributing profits and are focused on building “asset value” \nover “net profit,” C corporations do the job. The majority of publicly traded com-\npanies are C corps that do not distribute dividends to their shareholders. They \ngrow revenue and asset value.\nThe s c orporation\nAn S corporation is like a C corporation except that it isn’t taxed as a separate entity. \nConsidered a “pass-through” entity, taxes aren’t paid at the corporate level, but at \nthe individual level and reflected on the owner’s personal tax return. S corpora -\ntions also have some tax advantages because profits are not subject to the hefty \nself-employment tax that comes with sole proprietorships. However, unlike C \ncorporations, which can have limitless owners, S corporations are limited to 100 \nowners and will have additional filing requirements. \nThe Limited Liability c orp (LLc )\nAn LLC operates just a like a corporation with the benefits of a partnership or a \nsole proprietorship. LLC profit passes through to its owners, called members, and \nis reflected on their personal income tax. LLCs are also considered “pass-through” \nentities because profit passes directly to the owners. For partnerships, the LLC or \nthe S corp is the recommended structure in lieu of a general partnership, which, \nagain, does not offer liability protection.\nFor small startups, I recommend either an LLC or an S corp. Stay away from \npartnerships and sole-proprietorships, as they do not limit liability. Creating a \ncorporation is not as daunting as it seems. Depending on your state, it shouldn’t \ncost more than $1,000. In Arizona, one can be created for less than a few hun -\ndred dollars.\n\f\nseLec Ting an e n TiT y\nSelecting an entity depends on your goals and your vision for your business. Here \nare some general questions to help you decide.\n • What is your exit strategy? Go public? Sell to private investors?\n • What is your growth strategy?\n • What is your liability exposure in the worst case?\n • Do you plan on raising capital now, or in the future?\n • Do you plan to hire employees?\n • Do you plan to take on new partners?\n • Do you plan on earning profits fast? Or not for a while?\nYour answers will determine the best entity for you. In my businesses, I use both \nan S corp and an LLC. And finally, I’m not an accountant or an attorney and this \nshould not be construed as professional advice, so please, consult with someone \nwho has the appropriate credentials to verify (or disprove) what I recommend.\nc ha PTer s ummary: Fas TLane d is Tinc Tions\n • “Pay yourself first” is fundamentally impossible in a job.\n • To own your vehicle (you), start a corporation that formally divorces you from \nthe act of business. Your corporation is the body of your surrogate.\n • The recommended Fastlane business entity is a C corp, an S corp, or an LLC."

Lack of education? \nLack of opportunity, positive role models, or determination? Nope. Those are all \nsymptoms. If you retrace poverty’s footprints you will find that poorness starts at \nthe exact same place: choice. Poor choices are the leading cause of poorness. \nThe h ear T o F The Prob Lem\nAs my income elevated, so did my cholesterol. The road of good living runs paral-\nlel to a cliff of gluttony. My doctor’s preferred method of attack was prescription \ndrugs. I refused because I wanted to fix problems, not mask symptoms. \nIf you approach wealth like a big pharmaceutical company and attack symp -\ntoms while neglecting problems, you will not succeed. Feeling tired? Take this \npill. Want to lose weight? Another pill. The problems are ignored while the symp-\ntoms are addressed in catatonic cycles. I refused cholesterol medication because \nit addressed the symptom, not the problem.

When the \nbehavior stops the problem remains. \nHow does this relate to success and choices? Simple: If you aren’t where you \nwant to be, the problem is your choices . Your circumstances are the symptoms of \nthose choices. For example, everyone loves success quotes. Here are two: \n • The will to persevere is often the difference between failure and success.\n • Success means having the courage, the determination, and the will to become \nthe person you believe you were meant to be.\nThe problem with these quotes is they’re asymptomatic. They’re ambiguous \nto the real issue, and that is choice. The first quote deals with perseverance. How \ndo you persevere? You react from conscious choice. Not just one choice but hun -\ndreds, perhaps thousands. You cannot choose to persevere with one choice. You \ncannot wake up one day and say, “Oh, today I will choose to persevere.” It must \nhappen everyday, not just once! Perseverance is architected by many choices that \nfabricate lifestyle. If you quit after two tries, have you persevered? Can you claim \nperseverance after one failure? \nLikewise, the second quote suffers from the same conundrum. Determination \nis not a solitary choice but thousands of them. You cannot decide to be determined; \nit must occur repeatedly, concertedly, and with commitment. \nThe point of this dissertation is that Fastlane success isn’t one choice. It’s \nhundreds.

You can choose to believe these \ntheories or choose not to. The common denominator is YOU.\nYour steering wheel (choice) is the most powerful control you have in your \nlife.

Because it denies choice and gives it to someone \nelse—the company, the boss, the stock market, the economy, and a whole host of \nothers.\nPeople don’t choose to be poor. They make poor decisions that slowly assemble \ninto a poorness puzzle. Retrace the footprints to poverty and it happens slowly, \nsystematically, and methodically, under a steady diet of poor choices. \n • The choice to cheat on your exams or study.\n • The choice to squander college because your parents paid for it.\n • The choice to lie or to be honest.\n • The choice to drive without insurance.\n • The choice to befriend bad people over good people.\n • The choice to watch TV or read a book.\n • The choice to drive 105 mph in a 55 mph zone.\n • The choice to rob the corner convenience store.\n • The choice to overindulge in food or liquor.\n • The choice to believe in people with no track record.\n • The choice to cheat on your significant other.\n • The choice to buy on credit.\n • The choice to get high every weekend.\n • The choice to hire a contractor without a background check.\n • The choice to play video games 30 hours a week.\n • The choice to get married after four weeks of dating.\n • The choice to go into business with incompetent partners.\nThe r oad To Treason i s aL ways oP en\nI always loved a good street race. Having owned a variety of juiced-up Vipers, con-\nfrontation was standard. One summer evening after a few drinks, I let my ego take \nover and I street raced. I over-throttled, spun out of control, crossed into oncom-\ning traffic, and crashed into a palm tree. By the time it was over the new occupant\n\f\n158\nthe millionaire fastlane of the Viper’s passenger seat was the trunk of a 30-foot date palm. I was arrested, \ntaken to jail, and charged with DUI and reckless endangerment.\nLuckily, I didn’t kill anyone or myself. In fact, the arresting officer (who wit -\nnessed the entire race—brilliant, huh?) stated that had the impact been driver-side \nversus passenger-side, I would have been killed. I survived a life-or-death coin \nflip. In reflection, my choice to race was a treasonous choice. \nTreasonous choices are actions that do irreparable harm to your life, your \ndreams, and your goals. The consequences of treasonous choices throw life onto \nunintended detours and hazardous roads that are difficult to escape and often \ntimes, permanent. \nHad I killed someone, I would have spent years in jail, spent half my fortune \non lawyers, and had to live with the painful reality that I stole someone’s life. Life \nwould have instantly transformed, with new circumstances unveiled. No amount \nof money can keep you from prison or purge your soul from the foolish horror of \ntaking someone’s life. Treasonous choices change your life forever. \nJack finances his dream home and takes an $800 K mortgage although he \nonly makes $65 K/year. Due to loose credit and an exploding housing market, \nhe accepts the loan. He doesn’t read the documents and assumes his mortgage \nlender has his best interests at heart. Eighteen months later, his interest rate \nadjusts upward and he can’t afford the mortgage, forcing him into foreclosure. \nHis poor credit haunts him for 12 years. He can’t qualify for a new mortgage \nand potential business opportunities go untapped. \nA Fastlane millionaire by age 28, Andre has everything: a beautiful wife, \nmoney, a healthy baby daughter, and seven restaurants scattered across the \nFive Boroughs. Andre is on top of the world. One Friday night after a few \ndrinks to celebrate his night manager’s birthday, Andre drives home drunk. \nHe chooses to think, “I’m OK.” On his way home he gets into an accident \nand kills a family of four. Andre is arrested for drunk driving, and after his \nconviction he spends the next 11 years of his life in prison. He loses his busi -\nnesses and his family. \nAndre’s life forever changed because of multiple treasonous choices. The choice \nto drink. The choice to drive. The choice to think, “I’m OK.” The series of choices \nis plentiful, his exit strategy is clear. He doesn’t choose wisely. \nRecent events from the sports pages illustrate the gravity of treason. Football \nplayer Michael Vick engaged in criminal activity and it reshaped his life. His legacy \n(if you call it that) will never be the same. He lost respectability and two years of \nhis life. He made multiple choices that started with the choice to commiserate \nwith derelicts engaged in criminal activity.\n\f\n159\npART 6 — youR vehicle To weAlTh: youAnother NFL football player made a choice and it cost him his life.

He chose \nthe relationship. He chose to cheat. He chose to act. You see, we aren’t just talking \nabout ONE choice here but many that make him complicit to the treason. Steve \nMcNair’s choices loaded the gun but someone else pulled the trigger.\nYour life’s steering wheel is a dangerous weapon. Three inches is all it takes. \nJerk your life’s wheel three tiny inches while speeding and you can steer your life \nonto a path of no return, or worse, smack into a concrete wall.

A bad choice can set your trajectory off by only one \ndegree today, but over years the error is magnified.\nChoices have this type of divergence over time and it’s called “impact differ -\nential.” When your choices are extrapolated throughout the years, the divergence \nwidens.

    "raw_text": "164\nthe millionaire fastlane 1) Choices of perception (thought patterns)\n2) Choices of action (choosing to read)\nChoices of perception serve as the impetus to choices of action. If you believe \nand perceive a certain idea, you are likely to act in accordance with that belief. The \ndifference between the teen at the gas station and me was this: When I witnessed \nmy first Lamborghini as a kid, I thought, “Some day, I’m gonna own one of those!” \nMy choice of perception was strong and further manifested into choices of action \nthat reflected that perception. \nYou see, you choose to interpret events in your particular frame of reference. \nYour mind labels and categorizes events that surround you. For example, when \nsomeone says “dog,” you might see a black Labrador, while other people see a \npoodle. When you see a mansion on the beach, do you think “lucky?” or “I’ll never \nown something like that?” The first step in making better choices starts with your \nchoice of perception, because your actions evolve from those perceptions.\nIf you lose your job, you can frame it as a negative or a positive. When you’re \ncaught speeding, you can be angry or thankful. The choice of perception and its \nchoices start right between your ears and drive themselves into choices of action. \nyour Perce PTion i s n o T The r eaLiTy\nA few years ago, my girlfriend and I were at friend’s home for a party. We sat at a \nsmall table and noticed an overly exuberant gentleman moving from table to table \ntalking to people. He looked like he was canvassing the room as if he was selling \nsomething. He was. He eventually got to our table and unleashed the uncouth, “Hey, \nhow would you like to earn $10,000 per month?” The question was inappropriate \nfor the party so I decided to respond with equal inappropriateness. \nI asked, “$10,000 a month? Really?” Thinking I was hooked, he tried to sell me \na network marketing opportunity for some herbal supplement. I interrupted him \nand laughed “Listen, I make $10,000 every two days, so for me your opportunity \nwould be a 90% pay cut. Do you think I’m interested?” His eyes popped out of \ntheir sockets, and after he picked them off the table, he scampered away like a rat \nwithout his cheese.\nIn this brief exchange, this man made an assumption: $10,000 a month is a lot \nof money! It isn’t. Money is infinite. Fastlane opportunists can drive opportunities \nthat yield six and seven figures monthly. The difference is perception. \nI remember the day when I thought $10,000 was a lot of money. It was per -\nception and not reality. Earning $1 million in one month is possible if you make \nthe right choices and drive the right Fastlane roads. This perception leads to bet -\nter choices of action. That guy at the party? He chose a crowded road. Instead of \ncreating a multilevel marketing company, he joined one. Instead of serving the \nmasses through Effection, he joined the masses.\n\f\n165\npART 6 — youR vehicle To weAlTh: youw iPing T he w indshie Ld cL ean sT ar Ts wi Th Language\nYou can expose your mindset by examining the words in your language and your \nthoughts. Take for example this comment made on the Fastlane Forum:\n“I got engaged last Friday! I had been struggling with this for some time \nbut decided to give marriage one more try. She’s a great girl and deserves \nthe best, and I think I can give it to her.”\nWhen you read this statement do you see assured success? Or pending failure? \nWhile I wish the man the best marriage, I see flaccid words that lack confidence: \n“Try,” “I think.” This language spells trouble. What would have convinced me \notherwise?\n“I got engaged last Friday! I had been struggling with this for some time \nbut I decided to get married for the last time. She’s a great girl and deserves \nthe best, and I will give it to her.”\nNotice the difference. One is flimsy and the other is firm. Both might seem to \nsay the same thing, but one implies possible failure while the other implies com -\nmitted success. Your internal language carries weight. If a brain surgeon told you \nbefore surgery, “I’m think I can operate on you and I will try to succeed,” you \nshould freak out and trade in your hospital gown for some eternal nighties. \nAltering your words and thought perceptions are akin to wiping your wind -\nshield clean and seeing beyond your own sphere of sight. How do you manage \nyour choice of perception? What language do you use in your mind? “I never … \nI can’t . . . If only . . .” Or do you choose better words? “It’s possible . . . I’ll over-\ncome . . . I will . . . I can.” \nIf your world is canvassed with words like “never” and “can’t,” guess what? It’s \ntrue—you can’t and you never will! Is it possible to earn $1 million in one month? \nSure it is, just ask the guy who does it. What makes his windshield different from \nyours? Good choices of perception translate into good choices of action. To change \nyour perception is to change your future actions.\nThe goal of this book is to change your perception about wealth and money. \nBelieve that retirement at any age is possible. Believe that old age is not a prereq -\nuisite to wealth. Believe that a job is just as risky as a business. Believe that the \nstock market isn’t a guaranteed path to riches. Believe that you can be retired just \na few years from today. \nSo how do you upload new beliefs and overwrite the old ones? Find the infor -\nmation, resources, and the people that align with the new beliefs. For myself, \nI pursued the stories of those who acquired wealth fast and soon learned that “Get \nRich Quick” wasn’t a myth. I never found that 19-year-old who got rich piling"

However, I did find 24-year-old millionaire inventors, \nbusiness founders, authors, and Web site owners. \nIf you want extraordinary results, you’re going to need extraordinary think -\ning. Unfortunately, “extraordinary” is not found trapped in society’s gravity of \nthinking and the beliefs that fuel them. \nsT eering Ti Ps: b eTTer c hoices and a b eTTer Li Fe \nAs your journey progresses, respect yourself and ask, is this a good choice of per -\nception? A good choice of action? Is this going to be treasonous to my dreams \nand cloud my windshield to a better life? Have I chosen to be a victim or a victor? \nHave I chosen to surrender or accept the challenge?\nChanging your life starts with changing choices. The Fastlane vehicle to wealth \nis driven on choice, not asphalt. You start making better choices using two strate-\ngies dependent on the decision’s gravity.\n1) w orse c ase c onsequence a nalysis (wcca ) \n2) w eighted average decision matrix (wadm ) \nWCCA is designed to steer you away from perilous detours and treasonous \nchoices. Conversely, WADM is designed to help you make better big decisions with \nmultiple contingencies. This dual-pronged attack works on the choice extremes: a \nprevention of disastrous choices and a facilitator of good choices. \nworse c ase c onsequence anaL ysis ( wcca )\nThe first decision tool is Worst Case Consequence Analysis (WCCA), which requires \nyou to become forward-thinking and an analyzer of potential consequences. WCCA \nasks you to answer three questions about every decision of consequence:\n1) What is the worst-case consequence of this choice?\n2) What is the probability of this outcome? \n3) Is this an acceptable risk? \nWhile these three questions might seem lengthy, your analysis process shouldn’t \ntake longer than a few seconds. You don’t need a pen or paper, just your head and \na conscious choice of perception. When choices are analyzed using WCCA, poten-\ntial disasters are exposed and alternatives can be chosen. Unnecessary roads of \ntreason can be bypassed.\nI use WCCA extensively. For example, several years ago, after several drinks at \na local bar, I went home with a woman who was making the moves and wanted \nto get busy. She pulled the old Harlequin whisper, “Make love to me.” Of course, \nhaving known her for all of two hours, I knew this wasn’t love but something else.\n\f\n167\npART 6 — youR vehicle To weAlTh: youBehind my drunken passion, I ran through my WCCA analysis. What is the worse \ncase outcome of this choice? \n1) I could get a sexually transmitted disease. \n2) I could get her pregnant and be locked to this person for the rest of my life.\n3) I could be falsely accused of rape.\nWhat is the probability of these outcomes? \n1) STD: 10% (based on her outward promiscuity!)\n2) Pregnancy: 1%. \n3) Falsely accused: 0.5%.\nIs this an acceptable risk? I immediately reasoned HELL NO. The 10% or the 1%— \nI reasoned the risk was too great and that risk had outcomes that could change my \nlife FOREVER. I denied the woman’s advances and hid my lust in favor of a better \nchoice. What if I hadn’t? Sure, I would have enjoyed a quick romp of fun, but what \nabout afterward? Would I be put in a position of an unplanned pregnancy with a \nwoman I didn’t know? Would I be condemned with a disease that would jeopardize \nmy health and limit my search for a future partner? The potential consequences \nof this action had profound treasonous trajectories that I avoided.\nWCCA comes into play when I drive. Viper, Lamborghini, doesn’t matter—other \nidiot drivers looking for a street race constantly berate me. Sure, I might hit the \naccelerator hard for three seconds, but in those three seconds, WCCA takes over. \nWhat’s the worst that could happen? I could kill myself and someone else. Odds?  \n3%? Knowing my racing competency, the risks are dangerously high. I release the \naccelerator and don’t engage. The other driver? He speeds away with something \nto prove and in disregard to the potential outcomes. That’s OK, maybe there’s a \nreason he’s driving a ten-year-old fart-can Honda and I’m in the Lamborghini. \nWin the street race—I’ll win life. \nThe w eigh Ted aV erage d ecision m aTri X (wadm )\nEver wrestle with a tough decision? One day you favor option A and the next day \nyou flounder back to option B. Wouldn’t it be great if making a tough decision \nwere a simple as picking the higher number? \nThe second decision tool I use compares and quantifies big decisions. You \nknow them: Should you move or stay? Quit or continue? Go back to college \nor not? For WADM, you need paper and a pencil. Or alternatively, you can visit \nHelpMyDecision.com and let the web work the calculation for you. Keep in mind, \nWADM is for big decisions, so you might use this a few times a year whereas WCCA \ncan be used daily.\n\f\n168\nthe millionaire fastlane With WADM, decision-making is easy as it isolates and prioritizes factors relevant \nto your decisions and then quantifies each decision with a value. The higher value \nreflects the better decision. For example, if you had a choice between moving to \nDetroit or Phoenix, WADM would yield a simple numerical valuation like Detroit \n88 and Phoenix 93. Based on the number, Phoenix is the better choice. While \nWADM is subjective and requires your unfettered objectivity, it is a great tool for \nidentifying which choice is more favorable to your preferences. \nTo use WADM, a minimum of two choices is needed, but it could be used for \nmore. Let’s say you do indeed live in Detroit and are considering moving to Phoenix. \nYou struggle with the decision and can’t get clarity. One day you want to move, \nthe next you want to stay. Usually, this waffling occurs when there are too many \ndecision factors within each choice. \nGet a pencil and paper. Make three columns on your paper, one headed “Factors” \nand the other two for each choice, “Detroit” and “Phoenix.” \nSecond, what decision factors are important in your decision? Weather? Schools? \nCost of living? Being near family? Write down all factors relevant to the decision, \nno matter how small. Write these factors in the “Factor” column. Your WADM  \nwould now look like this:\n\f\n169\npART 6 — youR vehicle To weAlTh: you\nThirdly, next to each decision factor, weigh its importance to the decision from \n1 through 10, with 10 being the most important. For example, you are seasonally \ndepressed, so weather is assigned a 10 in your matrix. Subsequently, your children \nare almost 18 so you decide that a good school system isn’t a top priority and it \nreceives a 3. Do this for all factors. Now your WADM looks like this:\n\f\n170\nthe millionaire fastlane After each criterion is ranked 1 through 10, grade each choice 1 through 10 \nfor each decision factor. The school system in Detroit? You give it a 4. In Phoenix, \nyou give the school system a 5, as you determine it is slightly better. You assign \nentertainment in Detroit an 8 as they are home to your mighty Red Wings, while \nPhoenix gets a 6. Continue for each decision factor within each choice. Your WADM \nshould now look something like this:\nNext, for each row, multiply the weight times the grade and put that number \nnext to the grade in parentheses. For example, in the entertainment row, Detroit \nreceives a 40 (8 weight × 5 grade), while Phoenix receives a 16 (8 weight × 2 grade). \nDo this for all rows. Your WADM should now look like this:\n\f\n171\npART 6 — youR vehicle To weAlTh: you\nThe final step is simply to add up the graded weight columns to get a final \nnumber for each choice. The highest number will be the choice you favor. Your \nfinal WADM would look like this:\n\f\n172\nthe millionaire fastlane In this hypothetical example, you should stay in Detroit because it received \nthe highest score, 232 over 228. \nThe WADM is a great tool for making big decisions as long as you are perfectly \nhonest with the factor weighting. I’ve used WADM many times in my life to bring \nclarity to tough decisions. It proved I needed to move to Phoenix, it offered insight \ninto why it was time to sell my business, and it even steered me clear of some bad \nbusiness investments. \nIn 2005, I had an opportunity to invest in a Las Vegas restaurant. After I con -\nducted my diligence on the opportunity and the founders, it was time to make a \ndecision. I couldn’t decide. I solved my decision paralysis with a WADM analysis \nthat indicated I should turn the investment down. I did. A little over a year later, \nI discovered this investment turned south and that the investors lost most of their \nmoney. The WADM gave clarity to decision ambiguity and saved me from losing \n$125,000. \nIf you examine a map of the country, you’ll find millions of roadways: freeways, \nstreets, avenues, boulevards, all leading somewhere different. Your choices unearth \nthose roads, and they are either impressive shortcuts or perilous detours. These \ntwo decision tools are navigational tools for your wealth journey.\ng eT your e yes o FF T he r ear View m irror \nToday is the starting line for the rest of your life. Yes, today is the tomorrow you \nworried about yesterday. The problem with the past is that we remember memo -\nries we shouldn’t, and we don’t forget what we should. If your eyes are stuck in \nthe rearview mirror, you’re stuck in the past. If you’re stuck in the past, you’re not \nlooking ahead. If you’re not looking ahead, you can’t hit the mark of your future. \nThe universe doesn’t care about your past. It is blind to it. The universe doesn’t \ncare that I wore pink pants in high school. (Hey, remember Miami Vice?) The uni-\nverse doesn’t care that I got in a fight with Francis Franken and lost. The universe \ndoesn’t care about your MBA from UCLA, your drug-dealing father, or that you \nwet your bed in junior high. The universe simply doesn’t care. One person and \none person only weaponizes past transgressions: you. \nIf the universe doesn’t remember, why should you? Being the youngest of three \nsiblings, you can bet I was the subject of some vile comments. Fat, stupid, you name \nit. However, just because my brother called me an idiot for 12 years doesn’t make \nit my reality. Your past never equals your future unless you allow it.\nThink about a coin flip. No matter how many times it’s flipped, the next flip is \nalways random. Probability cannot be attached to a future flip based on the past. Your \npast is the same. Just because you failed at five relationships doesn’t mean your next \nwill fail, especially if you learn from them!

Every entrepreneur has bloviators in their \nlife. Network marketers consider me a bloviator. These people are normal obstacles \nto the Fastlane road trip. Remember, these people have been socially conditioned \nto believe in the preordained path. They don’t know about The Fastlane, nor do \nthey believe it. Anything outside of that box is foreign, and when you talk Fastlane, \nyou may as well be speaking Klingon. As a producer, you are the minority, while \nconsumers are the rest. To be unlike “everyone” (who isn’t rich), you (who will \nbe rich) require a strong defense; otherwise, their toxicity infects your mindset. \nCommiserating with habitual, negative, limited thinkers is treasonous. Uncontrolled, \nthese headwinds lead directly to the couch and the video game console. Yes, the \nold, “If you hang out with dogs, you get fleas.”\nThis dichotomy makes you a blossoming flower that needs protection, water, \nand plenty of sun.

I escaped and moved to one of the sunniest places on the planet. \nHad I not turned my back to my environmental headwind, this book would not \nexist. Where would I be today if I hadn’t turned my back to the tornado? I know \nI wouldn’t be here, happy, and retired 30 years early. Nope, I’d be on the Kennedy \nExpressway fighting traffic and strung-out on anti-depressants. I’ll pass.\nI made a choice to turn my environmental headwind into a tailwind. While \nI can’t blame all my problems on my environment, they enforced this disconnect \nbetween “interest” in wealth and “commitment.” \nAnother headwind could be your work environment.

Success follows \nthose who break the headwind and put it at their back.\nsigni Fican T oT her or s igni Fican T d is Trac Tion?\nThe worst headwind can be the person who sits in the passenger seat of your vehicle. \nThey sit and lecture you on your dumb ideas and remind you of your failures. Or \nthey don’t say anything and just distract you: They fiddle with the radio, adjust\n\f\nthe climate control, roll the windows up and down, and hum old Duran Duran \ntunes. Or they play the role of a back seat driver: “Charles! Charles! Do this! Do \nthat! Turn there! No, dummy!” What possibly can be so hazardous to your trip \nand who is this person? How did they get in your car?\nThis person is your significant other. By talking with other aspiring entrepre -\nneurs, I’ve learned that significant others (husbands, wives, fiancées, girlfriends, \nboyfriends) can be some of the biggest headwinds out there. Having a life partner \nwho doesn’t ascribe to your life’s ideals and philosophies is like towing a trailer full \nof wet manure. If your partner doesn’t subscribe to an entrepreneurial philosophy \nand toes the Slowlane road, can you expect to grow together in unison? Someone \nfighting with you in your corner is accelerative; if they serve as the opposition, \nthey become treasonous. \nOne of my first girlfriends was A+ marriage material. But she fully subscribed \nto the Slowlane philosophy. She couldn’t understand why I was so fervent to be an \nentrepreneur. Our relationship stagnated as my failures grew, and the relationship \neventually ended. This occurrence wasn’t either one of our faults; we just were two \ndifferent people on two different paths.\nBad relationships are roadblocks to Fastlane success. They drain energy and \ndim dreams. It’s like rowing a boat upstream. Unwilling passengers add weight, \ndistract, and sometimes are expensive to remove. Yes, divorce is treasonous and \nexpensive, both emotionally and financially. Traveling down the road less traveled \nis already difficult. Why compound the journey by weighing down the car with \nsomeone who doesn’t share your destination? Are you in the right relationship \nwith a person who believes in you and your goals? Or is your relationship just like \nlukewarm water, not bad, not good, just comfortable enough to stand pat? If so, it \nmight be time to evaluate your passenger. \nc ha PTer s ummary: Fas TLane d is Tinc Tions\n • The natural gravity of society is not to be exceptional, but average.\n • Toxic relationships drain energy and detract from your goals to be \nextraordinary.\n • The people in your life are like your comrades in a battle platoon.

Look no further than a $6 bucket of chicken. \nIt made big news: A major fast-food restaurant offered a free bucket of chicken to \nanyone who had an Internet coupon. People flocked to restaurant locations and \nwaited for hours, all for a free $6 bucket of chicken. Know anyone who would \nstand in line for hours just to get something free? \nAre you one of them? \nThese stories are common, and yet my reaction is the same: What the hell is \nwrong with people? I’ll tell you: These people value their time at zero. It’s free. Like \nthe air we breathe, they’re convinced that time is abundant and in endless supply. \nThey live as if they were immortal. They are certain that time, the fuel of their life, \nnever runs empty.\nI wonder if these people had three weeks left to live, would they be standing \nin line for a bucket of chicken? What if they had three months? Three years? At \nwhat level of mortality would they rule that standing in line for three hours for \nfree chicken is not good use of time? The greasy chicken truth: Value your time \npoorly and you will be poor. When time is wasted as a lifestyle choice you will be \nstranded in places you don’t want to be.\n\f\n180\nthe millionaire fastlane Take a look around. How do your friends, family, and peers value their time? \nAre they standing in line to save four bucks? Are they driving 40 minutes to save \n10 dollars? Are they parked on the sofa anxiously waiting to see who wins Dancing \nWith the Stars? The average American watches more than four hours of TV  each \nday. In a 65-year life, that person will have spent nine years  glued to the tube. Why? \nSimple. Life sucks. Life needs an escape. Life is no good. Show me someone who \nspends hours online playing Mafia Wars or Farmville, and I’ll show you someone \nwho probably isn’t very successful. When life sucks, escapes are sought. I don’t \nneed television because I invested my time into a real life worth living, not a ficti-\ntious escape that airs every Tuesday night at 8 p.m.\nAgain, majority thinking yields mediocrity, and for that majority, time is an \nasset that is undervalued and mindlessly squandered. \nThe Ti Tanic: h ow Fas T i s y our s hi P s inking?\nPeople standing in line to save money ought to hold a picket sign announcing to \nthe world, “I value money more than my life.” That choice is a primal mistake.\nA great example to time’s reigning dominance over money comes from the \n1997 movie, Titanic. As the ship sinks and few lifeboats remain, Caleden Hockley, \na wealthy steel industrialist played by Billy Zane, bargains for his life with a ship’s \nofficer and offers cash in exchange for a lifeboat seat. The officer rebukes the \ntycoon’s proposition with a stiff certainty: “Your money can’t save you anymore \nthan it can save me.” \nReflect on that for a moment. Your money can’t save you anymore than it can \nsave me. Powerful. In those eight seconds, the true value of time is exposed and \nwe intersect with the certainty to our own ticking death-clock. You see, once your \ntime is gone, you’re dead. And when your clock ceases to tick, no amount of cash \nwill save you from the end. \nFastlaners understand that time is the gas tank of life. When the gas tank runs \ndry, life ends. Time is the greatest asset you own, not money, not the 1969 restored \nMustang, not grandpa’s old coin collection. Time.\nThe fact is all of us are on a sinking ship. Is your time treated as such? Is it \ntreated fairly or carelessly? Or is your primordial fuel squandered as if the tank \nwill never run empty? \nyou w ere b orn r ich and w iLL d ie b roke\nTime is the great equalizer. You were born with a full tank of gas. There are no \nrefilling stations, and your one fill-up occurred the moment you took your first \nbreath. \nTime can’t be created outside of your mortal limits. Sure, we might be able to \nstretch a 76-year lifespan to 82 with good health and diet, but within mortality,"

    "raw_text": "181\npART 6 — youR vehicle To weAlTh: youtime is transformed from infinite to finite. The greatest theft of all humanity is to \nact as if our time on this Earth is infinite when it isn’t. \nThe reality is that time is deathly scarce, while money is richly abundant. On \nany given day, $3 trillion is exchanged in the world currency markets. That’s \n$3,000,000,000,000. To give that perspective, you can spend a million dollars a \nday for 8,000 years and you still wouldn’t have spent $3 trillion. That’s 109 lifetimes \nto quantify the total currency trading volume that exists for ONE DAY. Money is \nabundant and will be abundant as long as the world’s governments print more.\nNow, since you don’t have 8,000 years of life, isn’t it logical to conclude that \nmoney is an abundant resource while time is not? You can always acquire more \nmoney, but you cannot defy mortality. The irony of financial fortune is that no \nmatter how much you have, you’ll die flat broke. You cannot escape the continual \ncombustion of time as your tank drips time every second. You can live in blissful \nhappiness or in a miserable depression—time is indifferent and it just bleeds away. \nSince time is scarce, wouldn’t it make sense not to waste 3 hours of your life for \na $6 bucket of chicken?\ninden Tured Time i s T he r ansom o F Free Time \nThere are two types of time that will make up your lifespan: Your free time  and \nyour indentured time. \nYour Lifespan = Free Time + Indentured Time\n“Free time” is yours to spend as you please: TV, a jog in the park, video games, \nsleeping, eating, vacation. If you’re like most, your free time is lumped on evenings \nand weekends, where time is not exchanged for money. \n“Indentured time” is the opposite: It’s the total time spent earning money and the \nconsequences of that spent time. When you awake in the morning, shower, dress, \ndrive to the train station, wait, ride to work, and then work for eight hours—this \nis indentured time. When you spend your entire weekend “recharging” from the \nworkweek, this is indentured time. Indentured time is actual work and the work \nyou must do for the work. Morning rituals, traffic, compiling reports at home, \nsolitary “recharges”—whatever time spent earning a buck is indentured time. \nIf you won the lottery, you’d quit your job because indentured time is no lon-\nger required and is suddenly replaced with free time. Money buys free time and \neliminates indentured time . However, the irony of your free time is it isn’t FREE; \nit’s bought and paid for by your indentured time. You enjoy a two-week vacation \nbecause it was paid for by a year of indentured time. You can relax with a cold \nbeer on the couch because you paid for it earlier in the day with eight hours of \nindentured time. Indentured time becomes the ransom of your free time.\n\f\n182\nthe millionaire fastlane The r igh T Time Versus T he w rong Time\nThere’s the right time and the wrong time. The right time is free time; indentured \ntime is the wrong time. The Slowlane ransoms time—time at the job and time \ninvested in the markets. Remember, five indentured days for two free days is a bad \ntrade! A financial plan with time as the adjudicator is not a good financial plan.\nIf you were born into slavery, your life would be 100% indentured time with 0% \nfree time. While total time can’t be manipulated, you can manipulate your time \nratio. Wouldn’t it be nice to have one day of indentured time and six days of free \ntime? If you can steal free time from the hands of indentured time, life will have \nmore of the “right time” versus the “wrong time.”\ndum P The Junk in T he Trunk! \nIf you race cars at the drag strip, you know that every ounce of weight counts. Racers \nremove everything nonessential to make the car as light as possible. This increases \nefficiency, speed, and performance, resulting in faster finishes. Unnecessary weight \nforces the car to work harder. Yet on our road trip to wealth, we’re guilty of adding \nweight. Our vehicle is burdened with junk-in-the-trunk that coerces us to work \nharder. And when you work harder long enough, it wears you out and breaks you \ndown. This debilitating weight is parasitic debt.\nParasitic debt is everything you owe the world. It is the excrement of Lifestyle \nServitude. Your shiny new Infiniti financed at 60 monthly payments, your home \nmortgage financed over 30 years, your fancy designer clothes four months removed \nfrom out-of-fashion, and yes, even that insidious furniture that seemed like such \na good idea at the time. All of this crap creates servitude and forces indentured \ntime. When you’re forced to work, you limit choice, and limited choices close \nroads. Aside from my mother’s creepy doll collection, nothing is more frightening \nthan a parasite leeched to my neck, sucking my blood. Parasitic debt is a counter -\nweight to your road trip; it’s a bloodsucker that steals free time, energy, freedom, \nand health—all foes to true wealth. \nParasiTic d ebT consumes Free Time\nThe leading cause of indentured time is parasitic debt. Surely you’ve heard the phrase \n“thief of hearts.” When it comes to parasitic debt, it is the “thief of lives.” Parasitic \ndebt is a gluttonous pig that gorges on free time and shits it out as indentured \ntime. Any debt that forces you to work is expensed from free time and shifts it to \nindentured time.\nDebt needs a constant drip of blood, and that blood comes from your gas tank \nof life: time. And since time is fixed, an increase in indentured time comes from \nonly one source: your free time."

Having a lifestyle built on \ncredit creates Lifestyle Servitude in the form of indentured time. And because \ntotal time is finite, indentured time grows by pilfering from free time. Indentured \ntime leads to the Sidewalk.\nThe next time you buy some fancy gadget on credit, know exactly what you \nare buying. You’re buying parasitic debt that eats free time and excretes it into \nindentured time. \nFor example, if you buy an audio system that costs $4,000 and you make $10 \nper hour, what’s the real price? What is the weight of the poop? That price is 400 \nhours of your free time, since you must work 400 hours × $10 per hour to repay \nthe debt. Add 10% interest and your final cost stacks up to 440 hours of your free \ntime added to your weight burden. So next time ya whip out the Visa, calculate \nthe real cost. How much free time is this going to cost me? Everything we buy has \nnot one cost, but two:\n1) The actual dollar cost \n2) The free time transformed into indentured time. \nThe Law oF  c hocoL aTe c hi P c ookies\nWhen I first moved out on my own, I quickly learned the Law of Chocolate Chip \nCookies: If the cookies don’t get into the grocery cart, they don’t get home. And \nif they don’t get home, they don’t get in my mouth. And if they don’t get in my \nmouth, they don’t transform into belly fat.\nParasitic debt follows the same law. Control parasitic debt by controlling its \nsource: instant gratification, a trait of the Sidewalk. The next time you feel com -\npelled to buy some trinket at Macy’s, ask yourself: Will this be obsolete in six \nmonths and land in the garage with the rest of the junk? In four months, will \nthis stupid tribal T-shirt be relegated to that dusty side of the closet reserved for \npainting smocks? Again, when you purchase the next greatest fashion fad without \ntruly being able to afford it, you open the floodgates to parasitic debt that flows \ndownstream to the Sidewalk.\nIf the cost of that product doesn’t make it to your credit card, it doesn’t become \nparasitic. You become a protector of free time! Think! Will this purchase TAKE  \nFREEDOM? Will I own this or will it own me? While some choose servitude behind \niron bars, others choose servitude behind velvet walls. Both are the same. The \nultimate wealth is having the free time to live how you want to live. The Fastlane \nis about being both lifestyle rich as well as time rich."

I use it. Your neighbor uses it. No one gets more and no one gets less. \nTwenty-four hours for everybody. No one has an unfair advantage. You, me, we \nall have 24 hours to consume, expire, and spend. Time is the ultimate equalizer.\nThen why do so few get rich while the rest wallow from paycheck to paycheck? \nThe distinction lies in the valuation of free time, the chosen roadmap, and the \nacquisition of parasitic debt. Guess the behaviors—rich or poor? \n • This person sleeps until noon.\n • This person watches hours of reality TV.\n • This person drives two hours to save $20.\n • This person buys airline tickets with multiple layovers to save $100.\n • This person spends hours surfing social networks and gossip blogs.\n • This person is a Level 10 Druid in World of Warcraft. \n • This person watches every Chicago Cubs game (just kidding, all you loyal \nCubs fans).\nBehind the tangled roots of poorness, you will find a poor valuation of free \ntime, which breeds from bad choices. “Time losers” are poor evaluators of time. \nThese are the people camped out at Wal-Mart at 4 a.m. waiting to grab the early-\nbird sales. These are the people sleeping outside Best Buy hoping to score a free 32\" \nHDTV. These are the people waiting outside IKEA hoping to get a free breakfast. \nTime losers are also inconvenient savers. The inconvenient saver desperately \nclutches onto every dollar, fearful it may never return. Extreme inconvenience is \nnever a match for saving money. For example, an old friend of mine wanted an \nexercise bike and found it on sale at a store miles away her home. I told her just to \nbuy the darn thing locally and pay the higher price, which was an extra $29. Nope, \nshe was an inconvenient saver. Instead, she drove one hour to save $29. Total time \nspent? Two and a half hours. Subtract gas and the total valuation of her time is \nabout $5 per hour. Last I checked, she doesn’t work for $5 per hour, but has no \nproblem wasting her free time at this rate. The inconvenient saver gladly wastes \ntime to save money. From plane tickets with multiple stops to shared-shuttle air -\nport service, inconvenience is no match for saving a few bucks an hour.\nIf these people had three months to live, would they be outside Best Buy in a \nsleeping bag waiting? Six months? Six years? At what threshold will these people \npack up their sleeping bag on the sidewalk and say, “Gee, what the hell am I doing \nsleeping on a sidewalk outside of an electronics store? Is this a smart use of my \nlife?” Sidewalkers sleep on sidewalks.\nFastlaners exalt time as their primary consideration in decision-making because \nit’s our most valued asset . Fastlaners are frugal with time, while Slowlaners are\n\f\n185\npART 6 — youR vehicle To weAlTh: youfrugal with money. Sidewalkers and Slowlaners use money as the sole criterion in \ndecision-making: Which job pays the most? Where is the cheapest item? How can \nI get some free chicken? Money is scarce and time brings up the rear and sweeps \nup the mess. If you want to be rich, you have to start thinking rich. Time is king.\nc ha PTer s ummary: Fas TLane d is Tinc Tions\n • Fastlaners regard time as the king of all assets.\n • Time is deathly scarce, while money is richly abundant.\n • Indentured time is time you spend to earn money. Free time is spent as you \nplease. \n • Your lifespan is made up of both free time and indentured time. \n • Free time is bought and paid for by indentured time.\n • Fastlaners seek to transform indentured time into free time.\n • Parasitic debt eats free time and excretes it as indentured time. \n • Lifestyle extravagances have two costs: the cost itself and the cost to free \ntime.\n • Parasitic debt has to be stopped at the source: instant gratification.\n\f\n186\n27\nChange That  \nDirty, Stale Oil\nEducation is what remains after one has forgotten  \neverything he learned in school.\n~ Albert Einstein\nc hange T he o iL eVery 3,000 m iLes\nThe first lesson of car ownership: Change the oil every 3,000 miles. Neglect the \nlesson and your car dies well before its useful life. Frequent oil changes keep your \ncar running efficiently; unchanged oil goes stale and turns the ride rough. Rough \nrides stall to the shoulder of the road.\nThe Fastlane road trip demands fresh oil changes. But what is oil? Oil is educa-\ntion. Knowledge. Street smarts. But be careful . . . it must be the right oil and for \nthe right purpose.\nSidewalkers don’t bother with oil. After 3,000 miles, they’re done. Graduation \nis the last oil change. Slowlaners oil their vehicles for the explicit purpose of raising \nintrinsic value. Advanced education and certifications: What’s going to command \na bigger salary? Fastlaners oil their vehicles until they hit the junkyard. \ng radua Tion i s n o T The e nd; iT i s T he b eginning\nFace it. What you know today is not enough to get you where you need to be tomorrow. \nYou must constantly reinvent yourself, and reinvention is education. Unfortunately, \ngraduation traditionally signals the end of education. Regardless of your graduat -\ning age, adulthood begins. The party is over and real life begins. To cease learning \nat graduation is wealth suicide. Your most effective earning years happen AFTER \ngraduation, so wouldn’t it be smart to continue the educational process long after \nformal schooling?\n\f\n187\npART 6 — youR vehicle To weAlTh: youJim Gallagher graduated 11 years ago and is unemployed. Jim is a stock -\nbroker, but because of Internet technology his expertise has become endan-\ngered and flirts with extinction. Jim’s education for that specific job-set has \nbecome dated and no longer applies to the current world. The world has \nmoved on, yet Jim and his education have not. Jim contemptuously takes a \nmenial sales job at a local furniture store. His financial plan stalls because he \noperates with the same stale oil last changed 11 years ago. Jim fails to change \nhis oil so Jim’s road trip to wealth also fails.\nEducation, your oil, is a critical component to your wealth road trip. When \nyou continually inject yourself with new education, new skills, and new competen-\ncies, new roads open and things run smoothly. The right education has incredible \nhorsepower.\neduca Tion’s r oL e \nEducation is virtuous under both Slowlane and Fastlane roadmaps, but their roles \nare profoundly different. In the Slowlane, education is used to elevate intrinsic \nvalue, while in the Fastlane it is used to facilitate and grow the business system . \nAlso, Fastlane education is secured by methods that do not produce parasitic debt \nor conformity. The purpose of education within the Fastlane is to amplify the \npower of the money tree and the business system. You’re not a cog in the wheel; \nyou learn to build the wheel . \nFor example, if I go to a training seminar that gives me skills to “hire top-gun \nsales people,” I’m engaged in activities that specifically enhance the fertility of \nmy business and my money tree. If I read a book on a new computer technology \nthat illustrates how to create new interactive Web site features, I’d be learning to \nfacilitate the system. Again, Fastlane education is to foster growth of the busi -\nness system. Conversely, Slowlane education is designed to specifically enhance \nthe intrinsic value of the person receiving the education. It is to become a gear \nin the system.\nA Fastlane Forum user had an opportunity to pursue an MBA and he asked if \nit was worth it. My answer typically would be no, but this scenario was different. \nFirst, the MBA had no money cost, only time cost, as the government was pay -\ning for it. Second, this gentleman espoused the Fastlane ideology so his purpose \nwas not intrinsic value elevation, but expansion of his knowledge to facilitate a \nFastlane system. I voted yes.\n“i  don’ T k now how!”\nIf an oil change puts your car on a lift for months or years, what’s the point? Your \ncontinued education must not come laden with conformity or parasitic debt, but \nmust facilitate your Fastlane system. How? Make the real world your university. \nYes, you are your own university."

Oh, stop. Public enemy No. 1 on the most-\nused excuses list is, “I don’t know how!” Well, why don’t you know how? I’ll tell \nyou why. You don’t know because you haven’t taught yourself how, nor have you \nwanted to “know how” badly enough. You see, it is easier to relent under the weight \nof “I don’t know how” than it is to actively pursue the knowledge. In today’s infor-\nmation society, there is absolutely no excuse not to find out how.\nI graduated from college with two business degrees, marketing and finance. \nNeither of them was related to computer science. I graduated with no computer \nprogramming experience. Yet I made my millions on the Internet. Funny, after \n13 years of expensive institutional education, I  NEVER took a formal class about the \nInternet or Web technologies. Heck, my computer classes were limited to introduc-\ntory business courses. If I didn’t go to school to learn the Internet, how the heck \ndid I learn and become educated within this skill set? I sought to change my oil \nfrequently. I educated myself. I read books. I hit the library. I spent hours on the \nWeb and read articles, tutorials, wikis.

Imagine if you could digest every book, every paragraph, and every \nsentence. Would “I don’t know” be a detriment to your success? \nI’m astonished that education is freely available, yet most choose not to take \nit. Education is unplucked fruit from a tree, and all it needs is a ladder.

Since I was retired, I viewed this as a fun challenge, so \nI opted to do it myself.\nI hit the Internet and watched a few hours of video tutorials. Then I hit The \nHome Depot and bought supplies.

Now \nthey tell me how lucky we are. \nThe best investment you can make is in yourself. So be willing to pay for \nyour education now, or be prepared to pay a much bigger price for your lack \nof education later. The choices you make today will determine your financial \nfuture.

    "raw_text": "191\npART 6 — youR vehicle To weAlTh: youThe rich understand that education doesn’t end with a graduation ceremony; \nit starts. The world is in constant flux, and as it evolves your education must move \nwith it or you will drift to mediocrity. \n“i d on’ T h aVe Time!”\nTailgating the crutch of “I don’t know how!” is “I don’t have time!” Where on earth \nwill you find time to change your oil? I mean seriously, between the full-time job \nand the two kids, where is there time? It’s in between everything else.\nChanging your oil isn’t difficult when you attach it to existing activities of \nrepetition and consistency. While time might be linear, it can be manipulated by \nperforming double-duty on one time block, as in the old cliché, “Killing two birds \nwith one stone.” Maximize time and you maximize wealth. Accomplish two objec-\ntives in one time frame. Make life your university. Here are some time-cheating, \n“life university” strategies.\ndriving u niversity: Listen to audio books or financial news radio while stuck in \ntraffic. Traffic nuisances transformed to education.\nexercise u niversity: Absorb books, podcasts, and magazines while exercising \nat the gym. In between sets, on the treadmill, or on the stationary bike, exercise \nis transformed to education.\nwaiting u niversity: Bring something to read with you when you anticipate \na painful wait: Airports, doctor’s offices, and your state’s brutal motor vehicle \ndepartment. Don’t sit there and twiddle your thumbs—learn!\nToilet university: Never throne without reading something of educational value. \nExtend your “sit time” (even after you finish) with the intent of learning something \nnew, every single day. Toilet University is the best place to change your oil, since it \noccurs daily and the time expenditure cannot be avoided. This means the return \non your time investment is infinite! Toilet time transformed to education. \nJobbing university: If you can, read during work downtimes. During my dead-\njob employment (driving limos, pizza delivery) I enjoyed significant “wait times” \nbetween jobs. While I waited for passengers, pizzas, and flower orders, I read. I didn’t \nsit around playing pocket-poker; no, I read. If you can exploit dead time during \nyour job, you are getting paid to learn. Dead-end jobs transformed to education.\nTV-Time university: Can’t wean yourself off the TV? No problem; put a television \nnear your workspace and simultaneously work your Fastlane plan while the TV does \nits thing. While watching countless reruns of Star Trek, boldly going where no man\n\f\n192\nthe millionaire fastlane has gone before, I simultaneously learned how to program Web sites. In fact, as I write \nthis, I am watching the New Orleans Saints pummel the New England Patriots on \nMonday Night Football. Gridiron gluttony transformed to work and education. \nThink about the time you already use. How many hours do you waste in the \ntrivialities of life? This time doesn’t need to be lost, wasted time. This time is ripe \nfor Fastlane oil changes.\nTo start your oil recharge, choose a topic that interests you or an area in your \nlife that needs improvement. Not good at sales or writing? Get to the library and \nstart reading. Before I started writing Fastlane , I bought six books relating to \npublishing, writing, and authoring. I didn’t blindly write and publish a book; \nI educated myself thoroughly during the process. \nSet a goal to read at least 12 books per year, or one per month. If you are aggres -\nsive like me, you’ll read a book every week. I can’t stress enough that the more \nknowledge you consume, the more torque you create on the Fastlane road trip.\nThe $50,000 o iL c hange\nThe last time I went to one of those while-you-wait oil change places, an advertised \n$21.99 oil change morphed into a $110 bill because of extra service suggestions. \nAn oil change shouldn’t cost more than 25 bucks, and anything heavier should \narouse your suspicions. Twenty bucks is the average price of a book. Used books \nare less. Library books are free. Continuing education at a community college is \n$30 per credit hour. Oil changes are cheap. Yet, we continue to strap the chains of \ndebt to our ankles and pay thousands of dollars for our oil changes.\nI saw a picture the other day of a student publicly protesting one of the gov -\nernment financial bailouts. She hoisted a large placard that read: “I’ve got a 4.0 \nGPA, $90,000 in debt and no job—where’s my bailout?” Where’s your bailout? \nLet me tell ya, walk into the bathroom, flip on the light-switch and look in the \nfreaking mirror. There’s your bailout. I’m tired of sob stories from well-intended \nstudents who graduate from college with mountains of debt and can’t get a job. \nTake responsibility. You bought into the myth that college ensures a job. The fact \nis, when you allow market forces to drive your vehicle you’re likely to end on the \nstreet with a homemade poster proclaiming the value of your 4.0 GPA  and the \ncrushing burden of your six-figure debt. \nNo one cares. You’re in debt because you borrowed. You’re in debt because you \nbought into the lie and relinquished control. You bought the Slowlane. Were you \nforced to take loans? You don’t have a job because you voted for the politicians \nwho penalize producers and reward consumers. Face facts.\nAn expensive oil change that forces a lifetime of indentured time is stupid. \nAgain, parasitic debt doesn’t care about the source; it only wants to eat your free \ntime, preferably seasoned with a little salt and pepper.\n\f\n193\npART 6 — youR vehicle To weAlTh: youThe seminar Fai L\nWhat idiot would pay $50,000 to attend a seminar? Many do. This is a common \nquestion at the Fastlane Forum. So-and-so is offering a three-day seminar on real \nestate investment for $50,000. Should I buy it? What? Are you a smoking crack? Do \nyou know what you’re buying? Let me tell you. You’re paying $50,000 for someone \nto explain a book that’s found at the bookstore for 19 bucks.\nA $50,000 seminar is exploitation of what we producers know: People are \nlazy. People want it handed to them. People don’t want to read and connect the \ndots; they want it done for them. People want to be steered. They want someone \nto drive their vehicle. People want events, not process, and what better event than \na $50,000 seminar!\nSeminars can be great for education, but it has to be the right seminar, which \nis affordable and given by producers and experienced experts, not by professional, \ncareer public speakers. Most high-dollar seminars are well-orchestrated marketing \nmachines tailored to extract every dollar from your wallet. Most cheap seminars \nare daylong up-sells to a more expensive seminar. And those well-suited presenters? \nThey suffer the typical Paradox of Practice: rich from public speaking to millions \nbut not rich from what they teach. \nA member of the Fastlane Forum reflected on her recent seminar experience \nwith a popular book guru:\nFirst, you won’t be “allowed” to network. If you were allowed to network \nthen people would find out quicker that the seminar is just one giant sales \npitch for a larger, more expensive seminar to the tune of $50,000. Second, \nyou won’t learn a damn thing, except that you should have listened to your \ngut and not gone. There really is a sucker born every minute. Amazing how \npeople have nothing in the bank but can come up with $50 K just for the hope \nof something better. And finally, there is a segment in the seminar where they \nhave you increase the balance on your credit cards, because after all, the rich \nmake money and the poor earn it. So then everyone goes and increases their \nbalances, and then guess what—they hit you with the purchase price of any -\nwhere from $16 K to $50 K, depending on how “serious” you are. Ridiculous? \nApparently not, because people go rushing to the back of the room like cattle \nto slaughter, credit cards in hand. They leave with a nervous sense of self-\nsatisfaction and a cute little sticker on their shirt that says “I invest in myself.” \nA $50,000 oil change is as shocking as a $50,000 seminar. Good seminars \nare under $1,000 and are given by respectable experts, practitioners, and seminar \nfirms. Good seminars are educational and don’t come at the price of a new Cadillac \nEscalade. Bad seminars are hyped, high-pressure, and exploitative. Bad seminars \nare about making money and not about helping you.\n\f\nHow can you tell a good seminar from bad? The first tipoff is price. Anything \nunreasonable is a warning sign that the provider is more interested in making \nmoney than education. The second is price again. Be wary of FREE. FREE usually \nmeans eight minutes of education and eight hours of up-sell to a higher-priced \nseminar. Thirdly, who is giving it? Is it a professional speaker? Or someone who \nactually practices what he or she teaches? Read the fine print. “Johnny Guru’s \nstrategies have made millions!” and then the fine print says, “Johnny Guru will not \nbe in attendance.” Huh? Would you allow an acting surrogate to perform surgery \non you if the real surgeon wasn’t available? Fail!\nc ha PTer s ummary: Fas TLane d is Tinc Tions\n • Fastlaners start their education at graduation, if not before.\n • A Fastlaner’s education serves to advance their business system and their money \ntree, not to raise intrinsic value.   \n • Fastlaner’s aren’t interested in being a cog in the wheel. They want to be the \nwheel. \n • I don’t know how” is an excuse dismantled by discipline.\n • Infinite knowledge is everywhere and it’s free. What’s missing is discipline to \nassimilate it.\n • You can become an expert in any discipline not requiring physical skills.\n • Educational recharges can occur within time blocks already allocated for \nother objectives.\n • Organizers of expensive seminars take advantage of Sidewalkers and disen -\nfranchised Slowlaners by marketing empty promises as “events.”"

What’s the Redline? The Redline is pure, \nunadulterated commitment.\nMoney trees, businesses, and systems aren’t built overnight. It took Chuma \nyears to construct his pyramid machine. Commitment is money-tree water, sun, \nfertilizer, and cultivation. I know commitment is a word likely to cause a riotous \nexodus. If you think Fastlane process is easy, stop now and go back to the Slowlane, \nwhich isn’t easy either! \nRemember, “Get Rich Easy” is a lure with a hook. The creation of a vibrant \nbusiness is like raising a child from birth to adulthood. Like a parent has to com -\nmit to their children, you must commit to your system and your business. It is \nat the Redline where the limits of a car are tested, and that is where your limits \nwill be tested.\nare y ou i n Teres Ted or commiTTed?\nToo many people saunter through life coasting in first gear and then wonder, how \ndid I get here? Who doesn’t want to worry about money? Unfortunately, it doesn’t \ntake any effort to be “interested” in wealth and financial security. Interest is kin -\ndergarten; it isn’t enough, and those who have “interest” live in first gear. \nTo get out of first gear, you must make a concerted effort and a lineage of good \nchoices to exploit the power of the Fastlane. There’s a profound difference between \ninterest and commitment.\n\f\n196\nthe millionaire fastlane Interest reads a book; commitment applies the book 50 times. Interest wants \nto start a business; commitment files LLC paperwork. Interest works on your busi-\nness an hour a day Monday through Friday; commitment works on your business \nseven days a week whenever time permits. Interest leases an expensive car; com -\nmitment rides a bike and puts the money into your system. Interest is looking rich; \ncommitment is planning to be rich.\nMark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook, didn’t build the most-used social \nnetworking site by being interested. He was committed. Thomas Edison didn’t \ninvent the light bulb by interest; he was committed. Interest is quitting after the \nthird failure; commitment is continuing after the hundredth.\nWhile I was building my company, my system, my surrogate, I was committed. \nI’d spend 12 hours a day for weeks perfecting and building my system. I’d forgo \nnights drinking with friends. I lived in a cramped studio apartment. I’d eat cheap \npasta for lunch and dinner. I was ready to wash dishes to work my plan. While my \nfriends were more concerned with bragging rights for having the fastest car on a \nracing videogame, I wanted financial freedom. I wanted a fast car in reality, not \non a videogame. My friends were committed to being winners in a fantasy world, \nwhile I was committed to being a winner in the real world. Fastlane winners are \nforged at the Redline.\ndis Tance y ourse LF F rom “ mos T Peo PLe”\nHow bad do you want it? How willing are you? Are you willing to sleep in your car \nfor it? Are you willing to live in a tiny apartment while your friends own houses? \nAre you willing to forgo the new BMW in favor of a rustbucket with 150,000 miles? \nAre you willing to wait tables at Maloney’s Bar and Grill when your friends have \ncushy $50 K/year jobs? How willing are you? \nMost people aren’t willing, and it separates the winners from the losers. The \nidea of living in the rat race for 50 years has to be more painful than the idea of \nworking your ass off to escape it. You can have mediocre comfort now or meteoric \ncomfort later. The Fastlaner trades short-term comforts with the foreknowledge \nthat long-term extraordinary comfort is to be gained.\nWhen it comes down to getting in the mud and getting dirty, most people will \nopt for the smooth sailing of first gear and avoid the discomfort of Redline. The \nRedline busts through roadblocks and hardens process.\nWhen Carnegie Mellon University professor Randy Pausch was diagnosed \nwith terminal cancer, he blessed us with his last lecture. He said:\nThe brick walls are there for a reason. The brick walls are not there to \nkeep us out; the brick walls are there to give us a chance to show how badly \nwe want something. The brick walls are there to stop the people who don’t \nwant it badly enough. They are there to stop the other people!\n\f\n197\npART 6 — youR vehicle To weAlTh: youThe last two words of the quote are “other people.” You want to be damn sure \nyou aren’t “other people,” because “other people” is synonymous with “most people.” \nMost people are consumers who are two paychecks from broke. Most people won’t \ninvest long hours into their business system while friends are living it up on credit. \nMost people will allow friends and family to deflate their dreams with “that won’t \nwork” directives. Most people start excited and gush with exuberance but give \nup at the first pothole or failure. Most people succumb to “I quit” and give up not \nknowing that they are one or two plays away from a touchdown—the Fastlane \nexponential growth curve.\n“Are we there yet?” Wealth is a devious entity, and its elusiveness weeds out \nthe weak. Your journey will follow a predictable path of excitement, questioning, \ncommitment, and rebirth. Fastlane success requires an investment toll of time and \neffort. This is the toll that makes you special and keeps everyone else OUT. \nThis Redlined effort cannot be bypassed nor outsourced. Prime your expecta -\ntions for work and sacrifice, know your destination, envision your dreams, ready \nyour means, and know that you are simply paying the toll because you don’t want \nto trade 5-for-2 for life! If you don’t do the hard work that Fastlane opportunity \ndemands, someone else will. And if you aren’t like everyone, you will discover \nsomething miraculous: You can live unlike everyone. \ng eT your Foo T o FF T he b rakes! \nThe sweat of success is failure, and I am soaking wet.\nIf you’ve taken a step, spin, or aerobics class, you know the objectives: to sweat, \nto get your heart rate up, to build cardiovascular endurance, and to lose weight. \nIf you went to a cardio class and the instructor forbade sweating, it would negate \nits purpose. Hard work naturally produces sweat, and sweat becomes evidence \nof your effort.\nUnfortunately, this ludicrous analogy is the paradox you face if you fear failure \nand refuse to release the brakes. The sweat of success is failure. While you can’t \nbuild cardiovascular endurance without sweating, you can’t experience success \nwithout failure. Failure is simply a natural response to success. If you avoid failure \nyou will also avoid success. \nYou can’t drive the road to wealth with the brakes engaged. You have to take \nrisks. You have to get uncomfortable. You have to get out there and fail. \nWhat causes this fear of failure? Fear of failure is attributed to an overestimated \nworst-case consequence analysis. What is the absolute worst that could happen \nand the probability of it happening? You fail at business and have to go back to \nwork? Big deal. When you resist societal headwinds, you will sweat! \nTake calculated risks. Do so and things happen. You meet new people. New \nopportunities arise. Feedback pours in. “Lucky breaks” converge into your life. \nThe act of doing does marvelous things. Yes, the Fastlane is a risk. Failure is"

    "raw_text": "198\nthe millionaire fastlane imminent. I learned how to code computers by trial-and-failure. I’d fail a code \nblock hundreds of times before I found the right way to do something. My other \nfailures ranged from moronic multi-level marketing programs to jewelry to direct \nmarketing programs. Each time, I brushed it off, reanalyzed, learned, adjusted, \nand tried again. The brakes were disengaged, baby! \nI once heard, “A smart man learns from his mistakes. A wise man learns from \nthe mistakes of others.” You can learn from my failures. I didn’t learn the Fastlane \novernight. I found it by the light of failure. Fear of failure is normal, yet failure \ncreates experience and experience breeds wisdom. \nFas TLane r isks c an h aVe Li FeLong r eTurns\nBill Gates is a one-hit wonder. He built one company and made billions. One \ncompany was all it took. Some might say I’m a one-hit wonder. Great. I’d rather \nbe a one-hit wonder than a no-hit wonder. One hit is all it takes, and you could \nbe set for life. \nYou have a challenge: If you want to hit home runs, you’ve got to get up to \nthe plate and swing. Home runs or singles can’t be hit sitting on your butt in the \ndugout or sitting on the couch eating pretzels while killing grunts on Halo 3. Get  \nup to the plate and start swinging! Start striking out! After enough swings and \nacclimating yourself to the velocity of business, contact becomes easier.\nTake i n TeLLigen T r isks and s ki P The m oronic ones \nWhen it comes to risk analysis, there are two types of risk designated by best- and \nworst-case outcomes or consequences: intelligent risks  and moronic risks.  \nFlying to Las Vegas and gambling a month’s salary at the craps table is a moronic \nrisk. Driving a car on the freeway with faulty brakes is a moronic risk. When you \ntake intelligent risks and avoid the moronic ones, you amplify your wealth trajec -\ntory through time. Intelligent risks have a limited downside, while their upside is \nunlimited. Moronic risks have a bottomless downside and their upside is limited, \nor short term.\nMost moronic risks fall into the asymptomatic category. They simply aren’t \nclearly defined and it takes a little diligence to spot them. When I’m out racing \non the streets of Phoenix in an 850-horsepower car, I’m engaged in an asymp -\ntomatic, moronic risk. My upside is a short-term burst of adrenaline and a \ntemporary ego boost. The downside is crashing and killing myself or someone \nelse. The upside is limited and short—the downside is unlimited and long. Yes, \nit seems so idiotic.\nHere’s another moronic risk, and it took me this chapter to uncover it. I’m \nwriting this book on a cloud computing application. That means I’m writing to \nan external source, or an external server. I have not made copies of my work. If \nthe cloud server fails, my work is gone. Yes, moronic risks come in all sizes and\n\f\n199\npART 6 — youR vehicle To weAlTh: youflavors, and this makes me the idiot of the day. Excuse me while I go back up \nmy work.\nOK, I’m back. \nNow let’s talk about intelligent risks. When I invest $100,000 in an Internet \ncompany, I’m engaging in an intelligent risk. When I sold my Internet company, \nI reinvested part of the proceeds back into the company. I still own a minor per -\ncentage and it is completely passive. Why did I invest $100,000 and expose myself \nto the risk? I assessed the acquiring company’s probability of success to be high. \nTheir goal was to take my small company and transform it into a $100 million \ncompany. If they succeed, my small $100,000 investment would then be worth \n$2 million. The downside? The company could fail and the liquidation value of \nmy investment would lose about 50%. My downside is limited while the upside is \nsubstantial. This is an intelligent risk.\nIf you quit your job to engage in a Fastlane business, it’s an intelligent risk. \nYour upside could be millions. The downside? You might have to live below your \nstandards: mop floors, flip burgers, eat rice and beans, and ride your bike to the \ngrocery store. Is that really that bad? Not if you know your destination and your \ncommitment to the roadmap. Again, it all comes down to what you are willing to \ndo and not willing to do. Risk involves careful stewardship of choice. Minimize \nmoronic risk and take advantage of intelligent risk. As for failure, trust me— it is \neasier to live in regret of failure than in regret of never trying. \nsmack “ someday . . .”\nWhat prevents people from hitting the Redline? \nSomeday does. Someday I will . . . someday I’ll do this, someday I’ll do that, \nsomeday when the kids are grown, someday when the debts are paid . . . some -\nday. And yet, someday never comes. Someday is a distant horizon in the theater \nof your mind.\nSomeday is dangerous and paralyzing. It traps you in land of Nowheresville. \nSomeday is here, now, pristine and clean and begging no allegiance for tomorrow. \nThe Fastlane petitions you for this simple transformation: Make someday today . \nEver drive somewhere and all the traffic lights are green? Unfortunately, when \nit comes to opportunity and risk minimization, people wait for perfect timing—\nthey wait for all lights to go green, which summons the “somedays.” Ask anyone \nseeking Slowlane escape . . . why haven’t you made the leap? What are you waiting \nfor? It’s always some excuse . . .\n“I’m waiting for a promotion.”\n“I’m waiting for my kids to be older.”\n“I’m waiting to be debt-free.”\n“I’m waiting until I inherit money.”\n\f\n200\nthe millionaire fastlane “I’m waiting for the new year.”\n“I’m waiting to finish school.”\n“I’m waiting for my wife to get a job.”\n“I’m waiting for the economy turn around.”\n“I’m waiting until I fix the hot-water heater.”\n“I’m waiting for this . . .”\n“I’m waiting for that . . .”\nThe common thread is always the same . . . “I’m waiting.” But waiting for what? \nSomeday! Someday for something, some event, or some precondition. Sadly, these \nmentally constructed provisions come and go, leaving the opportunity seeker \nstuck in the same rut for years. Waiting for all green lights is waiting for the skies \nto turn purple on the third Wednesday in November.\nLet me be clear if I haven’t been: There is never a perfect time. Someday is today. \nToday is now. A week is 7 todays strung together while a year is 365. Today is all \nyou’ve got! And if you wait, opportunity passes. Your Fastlane journey never starts \nand year after year passes with new preconditions being added while the old ones \nare satisfied. While opportunity passes, guess what else passes? Time. Ring up the \ncheesy soap opera music. Yes, as time passes, so do the sands of your life . . . and \nthese are the days of our lives. \noPP or Tuni Ty d oesn’ T c are a bou T Timing\nOpportunity drives through your neighborhood frequently, and when it does, you \nhave to grab that bitch. Evaluate the risk and take action. Unfortunately, opportunity \ndoesn’t care about your timing. Opportunity doesn’t care about your circumstances, \nyour broken-down car, or your life’s turmoil. It comes and goes of its own will, has \na mind of its own, and it’s blind to predicaments. Opportunity comes dressed as \nchanges and challenges. Remember, change makes millionaires.\nThe “Fastlane Forum” (TheFastlaneForum.com) is my example of seizing oppor-\ntunity outside of my desired timing. My forum existed years before this book was \nwritten because opportunity drove through my neighborhood unannounced. My \npreconceived timing for the “Fastlane Forum” was after my book’s completion. \nHowever, years before the first word was written, I revisited a business forum that \nI had once frequented. I recognized familiar forum contributors lamenting about \n“the old days” and how hucksters had invaded the forum: people pimping their \nspam, schemes, and scams. It was a blooming garden of flowers that had become \noverrun by weeds. People demanded change or an alternative. \nIn my mind I had a forum coming at some point in the undefined future. But \nthis opportunity was not coming at my convenience. Opportunity suddenly turned \nthe corner and I heard its deafening exhaust. Even though I was in the shower, I got \nout, ran outside soaking wet, unprepared, premature, and met the opportunity.\n\f\n201\npART 6 — youR vehicle To weAlTh: youI greeted it, opened the door, and led it inside. Not in my time, but “opportunity’s \ntime,” and someday became today. That decision allowed me to presell hundreds \nof books before the first word was written.\nMany of the world’s successful entrepreneurs started businesses in college. \nYou know their companies: Microsoft, Dell, FedEx, and Facebook. Their found -\ners seized opportunity outside of their timing and chose to take an intelligent \nrisk. These entrepreneurs captured opportunity and didn’t wait for satisfaction \nof preconditions: “After I graduate” or “On summer break” or “After my Math \n202 exam.” Opportunities are dressed as unfilled needs, and when they ring your \ndoorbell, answer it! Unanswered, opportunity leaves and rings another doorbell, \nknowing eventually, someone willing will answer. \nWhy not you? Timing is rarely perfect. Waiting empowers mediocrity. People \nsit around waiting their entire lives for the perfect this, the perfect that. The per -\nfect scenarios and circumstances never arrive. What does arrive? Time, old age, \nand the specter of a dream lost.\nAnd now you have the opportunity to get out of the garage and take the road. \nThe road is where your Fastlane journey starts. Fastlane roads lead to wealth. You \nhave the Fastlane roadmap, and you know how the Slowlane and the Sidewalk \noperate. You know how to tune your vehicle. You know which mindsets are assets \nand which are liabilities. You’ve exposed the gravitational forces that will conspire \nagainst your vehicle. You have all the necessary tools to get out of the garage and \nget on one of the many roads to wealth. Yes, it’s time to hit the road.\nc ha PTer s ummary: Fas TLane d is Tinc Tions\n • Interest is first gear.

    "raw_text": "205\n29\nThe Right Road  \nRoutes to Wealth\nHe who chooses the beginning of the road  \nchooses the place it leads to.  \nIt is the means that determines the end.\n~ Henry Emerson Fosdick\nis y our r oad- To- w eaLTh a d ead- end?\nWhat is the road as it relates to wealth journey? If you’re a Slowlaner, your road is \nyour job: doctor, lawyer, engineer, salesman, hairdresser, pilot. If you’re a Fastlaner, \nyour road is a business: Internet entrepreneur, real estate investor, author, or inven-\ntor. Your road is your career or business path, and that road must be the route to \nwealth. Unfortunately, most jobs can’t route to wealth because of their mathemati-\ncal limitations and, surprisingly, most businesses don’t either! A road that starts \nin Chicago and leads east will never hit Las Vegas. It’s a dead end! If you’re on an \nerrant business road you have to use your steering wheel and make a course cor -\nrection: Exit the road, take a turn, or turn around.\nThis impasse confronts millions of business owners. They fool themselves by \njourneying the wrong road and then wonder why wealth has eluded them. Instead of \nfighting eight-hour workdays, they fight 12-hour store hours. Instead of leveraging \nthe surrogacy of a system, they trade time for dollars. Instead of trading five days \nof work for two days off, they trade 6-for-1, or 7-for-0, in lifelong perpetuity.\nIf you heed the Fastlane philosophy and start a lemonade stand on the street \ncorner simply because the Fastlane said, “Start a business,” I have failed. That \nroad is the wrong road because it doesn’t route to wealth. The road to wealth must \nroute to wealth! How? Your road must go near or through the Law of Effection.\n\f\nThe r oad To eFF ec Tion: The Fi Ve Fas TLane c ommandmen Ts\nThe Law of Effection says to make millions you must impact millions. How can \nyou impact millions? In the Slowlane you explode intrinsic value, become enor -\nmously indispensable, and earn millions. In the Fastlane, you engineer a business \nthat touches millions of lives in scale, or many lives of magnitude. If your road \ndoesn’t lead through Effection’s neighborhood or have an off-ramp onto it, sorry, \nyou’re on the wrong road. \nThe power of the Fastlane wealth equation is ignited by a business that drives to \nthe Law of Effection. Business opportunities are plentiful, and unfortunately most \nof them aren’t Fastlane roads. If you’re stuck in a retail store selling $10 haircuts, \ncan you reasonably expect to serve millions? To make millions, you must serve \nmillions. A kick-butt attitude is negated if your road is directionally challenged \ntoward Effection, because Effection is the gatekeeper to wealth. \nTo light the Law of Effection and illuminate your Fastlane road, cross-examine \nit against the Five Fastlane Commandments ( NECST, pronounced “next”).\n1) The c ommandment of n eed\n2) The c ommandment of entry\n3) The c ommandment of c ontrol\n4) The c ommandment of s cale\n5) The c ommandment of Time\nNECST is a Fastlane litmus test and validates your road. Does your road (or \npotential road) route to wealth? Is it Fastlane? Can it be made Fastlane? Can it hit \nEffection? Can your road route to a multimillion-dollar enterprise, generate pas -\nsive income, and end at a final liquidation event? \nA road meeting all five commandments can make you filthy rich fast. As vio -\nlations accrue, the road degrades in its wealth potential, and with it, your abil -\nity to get near Effection also degrades. While it’s possible to violate one or more \ncommandments and still create wealth quickly, you should aim for a road that \nsatisfies all five commandments. Potent roads are potent wealth creators. Sadly, \nmost business opportunities fail the commandments, and, if they fail, they don’t \ndeserve your respect or attention.\n c ha PTer s ummary: Fas TLane d is Tinc Tions\n • Not all businesses are the right road. Few roads move at, through, or near the \nLaw of Effection.\n • The best roads and the purest Fastlanes satisfy the Five Fastlane Commandments: \nNeed, Entry, Control, Scale, and Time."

They fail because they fail the Commandment of Need.\n(Need) – e – c – s – T\nWhen you build a business on a flawed foundation, it will fail. Sand foundations \ncrumble houses. Businesses that violate the Commandment of Need either belong \nto the 90% failure category or masquerade as a job. Gravity cannot be defied, and \nthe winning premise of business is a simple yet often forgotten by most busi -\nness owners: Businesses that solve needs win. Businesses that provide value win. \nBusinesses that solve problems win profits. Selfish, narcissistic motives do not \nmake good, long-term business models. \nThink about the purpose of businesses. Why do they exist? To satisfy your self-\nish desire to “do what you love?” To satisfy your craving for wealth and financial \nfreedom? Seriously, no one cares about your desires, your dreams, your passions, \nyour “whys” and your reasons for wanting to be rich. No one cares that you want to \nown a Ferrari and prove your parents wrong. No one cares that corporate America \nwronged you. No one cares! Yes, the world is a selfish place and nobody gives two \nshits about your motives to “go Fastlane.”\nSo what do people care about? People care about what your business can do for\n\f\n208\nthe millionaire fastlane them. How will it help them? What’s in it for them? Will it solve their problem? \nMake their life easier? Provide them with shelter? Save them money? Educate them? \nMake them feel something? Tell me, why on God’s green Earth should I give your \nbusiness money? What value are you adding to my life?\nReflect back to our producer/consumer dichotomy. Consumers are selfish. They \ndemand to know is “what’s in it for me!” To succeed as a producer, surrender your \nown selfishness and address the selfishness of others. \nsT oP  c hasing m oney— c hase n eeds\nNever start a business just to make money. Stop chasing money and start chas -\ning needs. Let me repeat that, because it’s the most important thing in this book: \nStop thinking about business in terms of your selfish desires, whether it’s money, \ndreams or “do what you love.” Instead, chase needs, problems, pain points, service \ndeficiencies, and emotions. \nEntrepreneurs fail because they create businesses based on selfish premises, \nand selfish premises don’t yield profitable businesses; they lead directly into the \n90% failure wastebasket.\n“I need a new income stream.”\n“I’m an expert in [blank] so I’ll do that.”\n“I read a ‘get rich’ book and it says to start a business.”\nWrong. Wrong. And wrong.\nAgain, selfish, narcissistic premises are VIP  invitations to violate the Com -\nmandment of Need.\nYou and your business attract money when you stop being selfish and turn \nyour business’s focus from the needs of yourself to the needs of other people. Give \nfirst, take second. Needs come first, not money! Needs precede money! Engage \nthe marketplace with your own selfish need and my bet is placed on your failure.\nJoe was a martial arts expert and he loved his craft. Following the advice \nof gurus, he set out to “do what you love” and opened a martial arts studio. \nWithin 10 months, his studio closed, as he could no longer support his family \non his $21,000-per-year business profit.\nBefore Joe started, he was destined for failure. He got into business based on a \nfaulty entrepreneurial road paved with sand, a premise based on selfish needs and \nselfish desires: “I’m an expert in martial arts and love the art, therefore I should \nopen a studio.” The correct foundation is externally based on needs in the mar -\nketplace, not on internal selfish needs. Instead of selfish motives, what should \nhave Joe been thinking?\n\f\n209\npART 7 — THE RoAds To wEAlTH • Is there a need in my neighborhood for a martial arts studio?\n • What are existing martial arts studios doing wrong that I could do better?\n • What improved value do I offer the martial arts student? \n • What assets do I bring to this community?\nJoe failed because there wasn’t a genuine need in the marketplace and his \nmotives were selfish. Had Joe analyzed these questions foremost, his odds of driv-\ning a successful road would have dramatically improved.\nSeveral years ago, during the economic expansion, I noticed a standalone \nstorefront being built in my mother’s neighborhood of Chandler, Arizona, a white, \nmiddle-class suburb of Phoenix. As the building went up and the store tenant \nmoved in, the heat of failure percolated. How did I know?\nThis new store was a hip-hop apparel boutique. Fasten your seat belt here comes \nfailure! Why? The store violates the Commandment of Need. The neighborhood \ndoesn’t need a hip-hop store. The area isn’t urban, there are no dance clubs nearby, \nand nothing looks remotely hip-hop. In fact, not 100 yards away there is an eldercare \nretirement home. Is a 91-year-old grandpa the target market for hip-hop gear? The \nobvious problem here is selfishness. The owner is following his passions, and his \nlove for hip-hop music and culture. Maybe a life coach told him to “do what you \nlove.” Whatever the motive, the need is internal and not externally based on the \nmarketplace. I predicted the business would last 12 months. After 18 months, the \nbusiness disappeared. The road was paved with sand because no need existed. \nmoney c hasers c hase m oney, no T n eeds \nFrequently I read posts from aspiring entrepreneurs with grandiose goals of mak-\ning a fortune by starting a business. Hang out at any business forum and you will \nsee the misdirected, selfish foundation poisoning the well.\n • How can I make money starting a business?\n • What business can I start with $200 and still make $5 K per month?\n • What home-based business can I start?\n • I have a friend who manufacturers widgets; you think I can make money sell-\ning them?\n • How can I make a passive income?\n • What’s a good product to sell on eBay?\n • What’s the best business to start on a shoestring?\nIf you sit around and ask yourself these types of questions, you’ll likely end \nin the failure category because these dialogues expose your preoccupation with \nmoney, and not needs or value. You’ve got it backward! I call these entrepreneurs \n“money-chasers.” They hop from one business to the next, scalping and arbitraging\n\f\n210\nthe millionaire fastlane market imbalances, rarely solving needs or creating momentum. Sometimes these \nselfish business owners use questionable business practices as customer needs are \nneglected and money is pursued with relentless zeal.\nMoney chasers are consumers who haven’t quite made the transition to producer. \nThey want to be producers, but they selfishly think like consumers. \nFor example, in the housing boom, money chasers became mortgage brokers \nand real estate agents. The burst of the bubble purged the industry clean of the \nexcess. Now with foreclosures at an all-time high, “loan modifiers” are the new -\nest money chasers. Every boom and bust brings forth the money chasers who are \nselfishly motivated to hop aboard a train of trends, but are in business solely to \nserve themselves. With plenty of selfish consumers to prey upon, money chasers \nsurvive and thrive until the next bust or they’re exposed for fraud. In times of \nexcess, scams, schemes, and rip-offs pervade because money chasers invade and \nimbalances are created. \nTo aTT rac T money i s To Forge T a bou T money\nWant to make big bucks? Then start attracting money instead of chasing it.\nMoney is like a mischievous cat; if you chase it around the neighborhood, it \neludes you. It hides up a tree, behind the rose bush, or in the garden. However, \nif you ignore it and focus on what attracts  the cat, it comes to you and sits in \nyour lap.\nMoney isn’t attracted to selfish people. It is attracted to businesses that solve \nproblems. It’s attracted to people who fill needs and add value. Solve needs mas -\nsively and money massively attracts . The amount of money in your life is merely a \nreflection to the amount of value you have given to others. Ignore this symbiosis \nand money will ignore you. Successful businesses share one common trait: The \nsatisfaction of consumer needs as reflected by sales in the marketplace. The mar -\nketplaces and consumers, not you, determine if your business is viable. If you sell \n10 million anything, 10 million people have voted that your product will help \nthem, or satisfy one of their needs. \nThe only Fastlane road that works is a road paved with cement—rock hard needs, \nwants, and solutions—not sand. A rock hard pavement gives you the unfair odds. \nSolve needs on a massive scale or in magnitude. It could be as fantastic as starting \na software company as Bill Gates did, or something seemingly minute like putting \na new spin on something old. If you own a Web site that services 10,000 people \ndaily, you’re making an impact. If you own a real estate company that provides \nhousing to 1,000 people, you’re making an impact. \nMake a freaking impact and start providing value! Let money come to you! \nLook around outside your world, stop being selfish, and help your fellow humans \nsolve their problems. In a world of selfishness, become unselfish. Need something \nmore concrete? No problem. Make 1 million people achieve any of the following:"

That is, unless you want to violate the Commandment of Need. “Do \nwhat you love” is another mythical decree perpetrated by hypocritical gurus and \nso-called life coaches who are probably three clients away from broke. Sadly, the \nroad of “do what you love” rarely converges with wealth. In fact, it might lead you \ndown a road to destructive love.\nIf you’re like me, “do what you love” was never an option. Think about what \nyou love and then think, will someone pay for it? Is it going to solve a need? Are \nyou good enough to make money doing it? Most likely, you aren’t.\nFor “do what you love” to work, you need two things: 1) Your love must solve \na need and 2) You must be exceptional at it. \nI love to play basketball, but I suck at it. I can’t parlay my love of basketball into \na career. I love to play piano, but again, I suck at it. I love many things, but I suck \nat them! If I wanted a career in any of these “loves,” I’d need unlimited time and \nmoney because no one would pay me a dime to do it. Who wants to endure that \nineptness? \nConsider this book. I love to write. The book represents a dream of “doing what \nI love,” and that dream was made possible by the Fastlane. If I needed this book \nto pay for my mortgage, I’m not sure it would. I have no clue if this book will sell \n10 copies or 10 million. Therefore I can’t rely on it.\n“Doing what you love” for money often isn’t good enough because we aren’t \ngood enough. Additionally, so many people are “doing what they love” that the \nmarketplace for that activity is so crowded and margins become depressed and \nheavy competition reigns.\nAuthoring a book is a crowded space. Just because I love to write doesn’t\n\f\n212\nthe millionaire fastlane guarantee money will follow. In fact, no one cares that I love to write. Do you? Of \ncourse not! You want to know if my writing will help you. \nIn a magazine interview, billionaire RJ Kirk was asked about the benchmark to \nhis success. He replied, “It is for others to say whether I am useful or not.” It isn’t for \nyou to decide whether you are useful. The marketplace makes that determination. \nPeople pay for their satisfaction; they don’t pay to satisfy your need of “do what \nyou love.” People pay for solutions, not for your enjoyment. People pay for solved \nproblems. People don’t give a dirty dog-ass about your love for whatever. If “do \nwhat you love” doesn’t fill a need spectacularly, no one will pay for it!\nThis book is possible because I didn’t need the confirmation of money to \nauthenticate my skill. If that sentence is not too complicated to understand, you \nget my point. Maybe I’m just not good enough. Regardless of sales, my book is a \ntestament to “do what I love” whether I’m good at it or not. The Fastlane allowed \nmoney to be removed from the equation. Now, I don’t need to get paid to “do what \nI love.” I just do it. In other words, money led to “do what you love,” it didn’t fol-\nlow. How’s that for irony?\nLebron James gets paid to play basketball because he is good. One of the many \ndestinations of the Fastlane is to remove the confirmation of money from your \n“do what you love” activity. Fastlane success means I could play basketball seven \ndays a week. I can play video games all day. I don’t need to get paid to “do what \nI love” because I can now do it for FREE. \nIf you are one of the lucky few who can earn an income from a specific activ -\nity that you love AND are good enough, kudos to you. And congratulations—you \nmight not need a Fastlane. A Slowlane just might suffice. No worries. But for those \nof us who can’t transform our loves into income, there are other alternatives paved \nby the Fastlane.\n“doing w ha T you Lo Ve” Fakes and d eri VaTiVes \nIf you can’t work a job or a business doing what you love, you’re likely to fall into \na trap. Your natural reaction is to make a deal with the devil—the Slowlane. You \ntrade your life away, doing things you hate, in exchange for doing things you love. \nYou say, “I’ll do five days of work I hate so I can enjoy two weekend days doing \nsomething I love.” Does this barter sound like rational thinking?\nFor example, my friend Andy is a bank collections agent and hates his job. At \nbeer time, I hear the complaints, the frustration, and the BS about the job: the \nNazi-like micro-management, the incompetent boss, and his psychotic co-workers. \nHe’s on the firing line from all fronts. He numbs himself to this suffering five days \na week. His salvation? His weekend. He pays “do what you hate” with a weekend \nof boating, which is his “do what you love.”\nThen other people negotiate with “do what you love” into an alternative, or a \nderivative. For example, Pauline loves to knit, so she sells her knitting online. Jose\n\f\n213\npART 7 — THE RoAds To wEAlTHloves automotive audio so he opens a car stereo shop. Janice loves to sculpt and \nsells her works at the local gallery. Gary is an avid bodybuilder so he becomes a \npersonal trainer. \nThere are two dangers to derivatives: \n1) They don’t make money fast.\n2) They endanger the love.\nFirst, “do what you love” rarely creates money fast because more than likely, \nnot only are YOU doing what you love but thousands of others love doing the same \nthing too (just tune into the first-week auditions for American Idol for proof). The \nneed is weak. This saturates markets and makes profit margins shallow.\nAt my gym, a personal trainer acquaintance told me he is struggling to make \nends meet. When I asked why, he responded that personal training is so competi-\ntive that he can’t charge a price worth his time. His service fees are deflationary, \ncaused by an abundant supply of trainers, and when supply exceeds demand (need) \nprices move down. Not enough need, too much supply.\nSo why is the field for personal trainers so saturated? Simple. People fol -\nlow the espoused guru-esque advice without reflection on need: “Do what you \nlove.” Unfortunately, if you LOVE doing it, bet on thousands of others loving it \ntoo. When you “do what you love,” prepare to face stiff competition. Who enjoys \nhigher margins? The personal trainer? Or the guy who starts a company to clean \nup crime scenes?\nThe second danger of derivatives is that your love becomes vulnerable to \ncontamination when you do it for money. If you are forced to do anything, even \nsomething you purport to love, in exchange for a paycheck, that love is put in \ndanger. \nYears ago, I took a job as a limo driver because I loved to drive. By the time \nthat job ended, I hated to drive. After work, I’d stay home because I was so sick of \ndriving. My love was contaminated.\nI once had a friend who created fantastic paintings as a hobby. When I asked \nher why she doesn’t paint full time for a living, her answer was simple: I paint when \nI am impassioned to paint. The few times when she painted for money, it stunted \nher artistic creativity because a different force fueled the motivation—money, not \nemotion from the moment. \n“Do what you love” is left to professional athletes, because they are at the pin -\nnacle of their games. And yet, even after making millions, many of these athletes \nsuffer the same fate. They lose their love of the game. Dancers lose their love for \ndance. Artists lose their love for art. Money and the demands of life cast a cloud \nover the love and darken it into a burden.\nWhile derivatives of “do what you love” might yield a figment of happiness, they"

Passion gets you out of \nthe garage and onto the road. If you have a passion for a specific goal, you’ll do \nanything for it. I had a passion for Lamborghinis and was willing to do anything \nfor it. Pick up dog shit, mop floors, work at 3 a.m.—whatever it was going to take, \nI had the passion to do it. Did I love driving limos? Hell no. But I had a Fastlane \npassion and it motivated my movement to the vision of future.\nYour vehicle needs an ignition, a starter, something that compels you to jump \nout of bed in the morning challenged to tackle the day. That ignition is passion. \nYou need a passion for something greater. It is different for everybody, but when \nyou find it, you will do anything for it. \nWhen you reposition your goals and visions at the end of a road that works, \nthat end transforms your daily life into passionate action toward that specified \ndestination. If you can’t get paid doing some activity, identify a specific “why” or \n“end goal” that ignites your passion to act. \nWhat is your WHY? Why are you doing this? Why go Fastlane? Whom do you \nwant to prove wrong? My “WHYS” read like this:\n“I want to pay off my mother’s mortgage.”\n“I want to wake up without an alarm clock.”\n“I want to write a book without the pressure of money.”\n“I want a big house on a mountainside with a pool.”\n“I want a Lamborghini.”\n“I want to make a difference.”\n“I want to prove him wrong.”\nPassion beats “do what you love,” because passion fuels motivation for some -\nthing greater than yourself and is generalized. When the focus is “doing what \nyou love,” the focus becomes industry-specific and you’re likely to violate the \nCommandment of Need. Why are you starting this business? Because you love \nit? Or because there is a real market need?\nI repeat: Passion for an end goal, a why, drives Fastlane action.\nMike Rowe, host of the cable television show Dirty Jobs, profiled several own-\ners of businesses who had less than lovable duties. From testing bovine manure to \ncleaning up pigeon goop, the owners were passionate. None of them “loved” what \nthey did, but they had passionate “whys” and very deep bank accounts.

The Fastlane isn’t \na destination but a personal journey .\nWriting this book has been an enduring journey, and I admit that I gave up \nthree times. Why? After a year of writing and not finishing, my love for writing \nevaporated. My love became a hate. I was “doing what I love” and suddenly that \nlove faded because people started to expect a book. I confided to a friend, “I quit. \nI no longer enjoy it and I don’t need to finish it.”\nSo how did I finish if my love for writing evaporated? I found my passion, which \ncompelled me to finish: I love to see the dreams of others become reality. When a \ndead dream is given sudden life, I feel invigorated. Any time I wanted to give up, \nI’d receive an email that applauded me: “Your forum changed my life” or “Thank \nyou, my life has turned for the better.” That is passionate currency that repositioned \nmy writing effort into action.

Reflect back to childhood, when you heard: “What do you \nwant to be when you grow up?” Underneath this question, what’s it really asking? \nIt’s a probe to find the road to your dreams, and it was usually answered in a phan-\ntasmal vision. For me, I wanted to be an astronaut (blame Han Solo) a filmmaker \n(blame George Lucas) and an author (blame Isaac Asimov). \nHow about you? What is your outrageous, fantastic dream? And the real ques-\ntion of concern: Is there any chance you are doing it, or will be doing it? More than \nlikely, you’re not, because the Slowlane has killed it. \nI asked my friend Rick this question. Guess what. He didn’t answer this question \nwith “I want to be a sales representative at Verizon Wireless.” Nope. He answered \nwith “I wanted to be a race car driver.” So, why is Rick selling cell phones today? \nIs there any chance in hell he will actually become his dream, a racecar driver? \nThere isn’t. The dream is dead and the road is derelict. Nonetheless, as Rick \nsticks to his job and waits for a promotion, he wonders, “There’s got to be more \nthan this.”\nAnd then there’s Sarah. She didn’t answer this question with, “I want to be a \nshift manager at Taco Bell.” Nope, she wanted to be an artist. But today, Sarah \nfinds herself working the graveyard shift, mopping up the floors in the dining\n\f\n216\nthe millionaire fastlane room from slobs who have mistaken sour cream for finger paint. As she slams \nthe mop-head in the wringer, Sarah has a moment of disquiet. “Is this what my \nlife has become?”\nThe problem with these people is not their jobs. We’ve all had crappy, embarrass-\ning jobs that we hate. The problem is their dead-end road that will never converge \nwith a dream. Dreams are forsaken to pay the bills. Instead of a convergent road to \ndreams (or a chance of a dream), their road goes through an inescapable hell. Life \nbecomes suffering. There is nothing wrong with working at Verizon or Taco Bell. \nHeck, these jobs would have been promotions in comparison to the meaningless \njobs I’ve held. But please, don’t make these jobs your means to the end, your final \nroad, because the “end” most likely will never come.\nYou see, if your dream is dead, so is your passion. “No passion” numbs you to \nthe greatest violinist in the world while he plays in the train depot. “No passion” \nleads to mediocrity and the land of everybody. “No passion” leads to unhappiness. \n“No passion” equals no wealth.\nIf you’re struggling for motivation, re-energize your dream and align it with \na road capable of burning a trail to its reality. Dead dreams can’t burn trails of \npassion. Passion fires your will to do what is necessary beyond what others can’t. \nFastlaners work unlike everyone else so they can live unlike anyone else. Take \nfour years of hard work in exchange for 40 years of freedom. Unfortunately, most \npeople take 40 years of hard work for four weeks of freedom, or however long their \npaid vacation time lasts.\nFind y our “ snow in T he Toi LeT” \nHow do you find your passion? Passion comes from either excitement or discontent. \nTake this story posted on the Fastlane Forum (TheFastlaneForum.com):\nI grew up in a poor family and lived in a very old run-down barn that \nhad half of it converted into a home. One of the worst times of the year was \nthe winter, because our water pipes would freeze and, with it, our running \nwater. The only way to flush the toilet was to bring snow into the barn, pack \nit into the water tank behind the toilet, and wait for it to melt. I saw that my \nmom had to put snow in the tank of the toilet bowl just for us to flush. The \nworst part was that it had to be refilled every time someone used the toilet. \nI thought to myself, “I never want to live like this again!”\nWhat is your passion—your perennial “snow in the toilet?”\nLeslie Walburn is passionate about animals. Disillusioned by county-\nowned shelters that euthanize dogs, her dream is to own a no-kill dog rescue \nshelter. While she can “do what she loves” and get a job at a shelter, it doesn’t"

Months earlier, I had become involved in \na network marketing company, and this was their monthly motivational meeting. \nThe crowd was excited, anxious, and revved up. \nI wasn’t. I looked around and saw a problem. I saw an army of drones clutch-\ning onto whatever was said, critical reasoning cast aside, and myself about to be \nindoctrinated. I didn’t go so easy. I asked questions. I was persistent, nosy, and \ncurious about the road I was about to take. \n“How much money are you making?” I asked early and often. Like politicians, \nthe answer was sideswiped and deflected to a default person in the organization, \nbut I wasn’t fooled. OK, you’ve already told me that Bill Hanson makes $30,000 \na month, but how much do you make? And you? And you? And the other 3,000 \npeople in this room? The fact is, few of them made any money at all. Why? They \nwere stuck driving a congested road full of traffic that failed the Commandment \nof Entry. Crowded, jammed roads move slowly, if at all.\n\f\n220\nthe millionaire fastlane The c ommandmen T o F en Try\nI failed networking marketing four times because subconsciously I possessed the \ntruth: The road was a violation to the Commandment of Entry. \nn – ( En Try) – c – s – T\nThe Commandment of Entry states that as entry barriers to any business road \nfall, or lessen, the effectiveness of that road declines while competition in that field \nsubsequently strengthens. Higher entry barriers equate to stronger, more powerful \nroads with less competition and less need for exceptionality.\nLow-barrier-entry businesses are weak roads because easy entry creates high \ncompetition and high traffic, all of which share the same pie. And where there is \ntraffic, there is no movement.\nIn other words, if “getting into business” is as simple as paying $200 for a \ndistributor kit, there are no entry barriers, and the opportunity should be passed. \nIf any Joe Blow napping behind Chan’s Chinese restaurant in the alley next to a \ndumpster can start your business in minutes, it isn’t a business you want to be \ndoing! The world is littered with so-called businesses that have no entry barriers. \nAnd that is why they suck and the people who follow them aren’t rich.\nA decade ago the big buzz was “Make millions on eBay!” It didn’t last long \nbecause this opportunity eventually violated the Commandment of Entry. If you \ncould create an eBay business in 10 minutes, guess what? So could millions of \nother people. And who made the millions? The early adopters, eBay, and eBay’s \nfounders. They drove the Fastlane and picked up millions of hitchhikers along the \nway. Few did well, while millions did not.\nThe big buzz just months ago was Internet blogging. Bloggers are making \nthousands! True, but nowadays, the multimillionaire blogger is now the excep -\ntion rather than the rule. Why? The opportunity has been beaten down by ease of \nentry, causing traffic, competition, and saturation. Saturation causes noise. Noise \ncauses declining sales volumes. Declining sales volumes cause profit erosion. If \nanyone can start a business in one day or less doing what you do, you probably are \nviolating the Commandment of Entry and tough odds are ahead.\nNetwork marketing, or multi-level marketing (MLM) , always fails the \nCommandment of Entry—unless you own and create the MLM company yourself. \nIf you’re in a room with 2,000 other people who do exactly what you do, you’re \nfighting stiff odds. Who is the innovator, the leader, and the one standing on a \ncliff parting the Red Sea? The guy on stage who founded the MLM company is the \nFastlaner. And you? Sorry, but you’re just another soldier in his Fastlane army, a \ncog in his marketing strategy. The MLM founder doesn’t need to climb the pyramid, \nbecause he built the pyramid! You can be a pyramid builder or a pyramid climber. \nYou can be the sheep or the sheepherder.\n\f\n221\npART 7 — THE RoAds To wEAlTH“eXce PTiona Lism” i s r equired To oV ercome w eak e n Try\nIf you violate the Commandment of Entry, be prepared to be exceptional . \nExceptionality breaks the odds of entry. Unfortunately, exceptionality is a long \nshot, much like an above-average high school athlete going pro.\nFor example, when I sat in that auditorium with thousands of other network \nmarketers, I realized that to exceed among thousands doing the same thing, I had \nto be exceptional. I had to be the best. Honest with myself, I knew I couldn’t be \nexceptional in that construct. Could I be the exceptional one among 50,000 like-\nminded “distributors?” I was doubtful. Conversely, when I started my Internet busi-\nness I had roughly 12 competitors. Could I be exceptional among 12? Absolutely.\nAnother example of exceptionality is playing professional poker and financial \ntrading, like stocks, futures, and currency trading. Both disciplines violate entry \nand have little to no restrictions to access. I can go to Vegas with $10,000 and enter \na poker tournament any time I like. I can deposit $10,000 in a trading account and \nstart trading currency. Lack of entry itself creates the marketplace , and to succeed \nin that marketplace, you have to be exceptional. The best (and the richest) poker \nplayers in the world are exceptional and take advantage of the weakest lured by \nweak entry. The pros call these folks “dead money.”\nThe same playing field exists in the currency markets. Newbies come and go, \ntrading currencies, expecting to make a fortune, while the only folks making the \nmillions are the exceptional participants and the purveyors of the field, like the \ncurrency platforms, brokerage houses, and poker Web sites.\nThere’s an old saying, “In a gold rush, don’t dig for gold, sell shovels!” When \nit comes to entry, your industry and your business should not be available to \neveryone, because if it is, you must be prepared to be exceptional. And if you are \nexceptional, easy entry becomes not a liability, but an asset.\nen Try i s a Process, n o T an eV en T \nWant to know if your business violates entry? The answer is another simple ques-\ntion: Is getting into business an event or a process? Real business startups are pro -\ncesses, not events. If you’re suddenly in business because you bought a distributor \nkit, or you completed an online form, you’re violating entry. If you’re suddenly \nin business because you took one or two actions, you violate entry. Conversely, if \nI wanted to start a bed-and-breakfast in Napa Valley, I’d have to find a property, \nfix it, finance it, insure it, get licensing and permits, hire a staff, and perform about \n10 other steps. Entry is a detailed process.\nStarting a business, like wealth, is a concerted series of choices that form pro -\ncess. Founders of network marketing companies do spectacularly well because they \nknow that people love events, and what better event is there than “Complete this \napplication and you’re in business!” They leverage entry ease as an advantage . As\n\f\n222\nthe millionaire fastlane entrepreneurs, we want to start companies that others can join as an event. Don’t \nfool yourself. Mailing a check to some address listed in the back of an entrepreneur \nmagazine isn’t a business embryo. Any business that takes 10 minutes to do/join/\nparticipate violates entry. Violate entry and you stamp your ticket into the world \nof everyone and become apart of someone else’s Fastlane plan. \neVeryone i s d oing iT !\nEver get stuck in traffic on the expressway and go nowhere for hours? Welcome \nto “everyone is doing it.” A road full of traffic is a road full of everyone. If every -\none is doing it, I won’t be doing it. I’ll exit the road, and you should too. Why? \nBecause everyone isn’t wealthy. If everyone were wealthy, “everybody is doing it” \nwould work.\nWhen it comes to money, the best warning flag is “everyone.” Everyone is a red \nflag that the Commandment of Entry has been violated. If everyone is engaged in \nthe same activity, it surely will fail. \nWhile “everyone” was buying houses like crazy during the housing boom, I did \nthe opposite. I sat on the sidelines and sold. When the frenzy is buying, you should \nbe selling. When the frenzy is selling, you should be buying or staying pat.\nHistory is littered with “everyone is doing it” booms and busts. In the last \ndecade alone, including the tech stock boom of the late 1990s, the great oil price \nexplosion, and, more recently, the housing bust that led to the worldwide financial \nmeltdown, there are perfect examples of “everyone is doing it.” Everyone is doing \nit is a heavily trafficked road that moves slowly toward impending doom, like a \nherd of lambs heading for slaughter. \nThe w arning s igns o F “eVeryone”\nIn the late 1990s when tech stocks were skyrocketing, I lost money because I fol -\nlowed everyone. I learned. During the latest housing boom, I didn’t buy a house. \nNo, this time I sold three properties before the decline. While the housing market \ncollapsed and stocks soon followed, I was long gone and sitting in cash. How did \nI know?\nI spotted the signs of “everyone is doing it,” because if everyone were rich, \n“everybody is doing it” would work. While this logic might seem spurious, it has \nnever failed me. How do I know when “everyone is doing it?” Simple. When there is \nirrational exuberance about any investment that pervades to Team Consumer—the \ngeneral populous—that’s when I know it is time to GET OUT AND STAY OUT.\nWhen the plumber comes over to fix the toilet and raves about his three rental \nproperties that have appreciated 15% in the last three months, it’s time to get out \nand stay out. When your personal trainer raves about his Internet stock portfolio \nthat earned 40% in two months, it’s time to get out and stay out. When your truck-\n\f\n223\npART 7 — THE RoAds To wEAlTHdriving cousin calls you and asks about investing in oil because it’s $150 a barrel, \nit’s time to get out and stay out. Dumb money— EVERYONE—always shows up at \nthe end of a boom. Who is dumb money? Consumers! Money chasers! But some \nshrewd people have mastered the Rule of Everyone. Instead of getting out, they \nshort the other side and profit from the downfall. With every busted boom, new \nmillionaires and billionaires are created because they saw the impending collapse \ninevitable in every meteoric irrational ascension.\nWhile the stock market imploded in early 2009, who was buying and who \nwas selling? Everyone was selling. I was long gone and sold a year earlier. Warren \nBuffet was buying. Everyone sells and the richest man in the world buys. Hmmm. \nCould it be that everyone is wrong? Yes it could.\nIf you want to live unlike everyone, you can’t be like everyone . Don’t confuse \nthat with exceptionality. You have to lead the pack and have “everyone” fol -\nlow. When the lambs are lining up single-file for slaughter, you want to own the \nslaughterhouse.\nc ha PTer s ummary: Fas TLane d is Tinc Tions\n • The Commandment of Entry states that as entry barriers fall, competition rises \nand the road weakens.\n • Easy access roads carry more traffic.

Or HITCHHIKING one?\nIf this hitchhiker description describes you, don’t get discouraged or defensive. \nYou can’t be a driver in every instance. Heck, even I engage in hitchhiking activi-\nties. Fastlane hitchhikers can make good money, sometimes boatloads. However, \nunderstand this: The driver retains control and makes the big money. At best, the \nhitchhiker makes good money .\ngood m oney Versus b ig m oney\nThere is a difference between good money, big money, and legendary money. Good \nmoney is $20,000/month. \nThe cattle call of every network marketing company is, “Hey, wanna make \n$10,000 a month?” Big deal. Remember your windshield. It’s big money only in \nyour head. That’s decent money but nothing that’s going to put you into a private \njet and 40-foot yacht on Newport Beach.\nBig money is $ 200 ,000/month. Now we’re talking— $ 200 ,000 every month \nwill make a dent into your lifestyle. When you earn this level of income, life \nchanges. \nAnd then there is legendary money, where you earn more than a million dollars \nevery month. Outrageous? Not at all. When you leverage all five commandments \nand control your company, one million a month is not impossible. \nTo hit big money or legendary money, you need to control your system and \nevery aspect of that system. When you relinquish control and defer power to a\n\f\n226\nthe millionaire fastlane higher authority, you cede big money to the driver and accept good money as the \npassenger. For example, my Web site offered an affiliate program. My best affiliate \nconsistently earned $20,000+/month. Yes, he was making good money. He was \nthe hitchhiking passenger, and I was the driver, controlling the affiliate process. \nHowever, think about the danger he assumed. At any moment I could have insti-\ntuted a “new policy” that would have reduced his earnings. I drove his income \nstream, and he absorbed the risk that I wouldn’t disturb, alter, or modify the affili-\nate agreement. And most importantly, as a driver, I was the one making big money \n($200,000/month), while he settled for good money ($20,000/month). \nSimilarly, you might have heard of a unique group of Internet entrepreneurs \ncalled “AdSense” millionaires. Google Adsense is an advertiser network that online \ncontent publishers leverage to earn income from their Web sites’ traffic. There are \naffiliates, bloggers, and publishers who earn good money from using Google’s \nAdSense program. Some content providers and bloggers earn six figures monthly. \nArguably, this is big money, yet Google (the driver) makes the legendary money.\nn o c on Tro L = c rashes\nThink about the dangers of hitchhiking. You get into some stranger’s car and you \nlet them drive. Hitchhiking a Fastlane is an incredible risk, especially when your \nfamily is the cargo. My experience has repeated itself for countless entrepreneurs \nwho learned the hard way. \nSome background: My forum leverages the Google advertising network, which \npays revenue for ad clicks that evolve from my forum. It is a hitchhiking relation-\nship—Google is the driver and my forum is the passenger. A thread at my forum \ndiscussed an e-book marketing program. As the thread progressed, a joke was made \nabout a former bankrupt NBA player, and (long story short) the folks at Google \nclaimed the content violated their terms. My ads were terminated and the revenue \nstopped. Now imagine if this forum and the Google revenue were responsible \nfor feeding my family. Imagine if I relied on it. Imagine if I was earning $15,000/\nmonth from these ads and in one big swoop, it was gone.\nNo control. No say. No power. It took me eight days to resolve the problem, but \nit exposed the dangers of hitchhiking a Fastlane as a passenger versus driving it. \nFor those eight days, my income from that activity was zero. In any driver/hitch -\nhiker relationship, the driver always makes more money than the hitchhiker and \nretains a critical component to Fastlane strategy: control .\nI can’t imagine running a company in which another entity has the power \nto instantaneously kill your revenue stream. If someone can “flip a switch” and \ndestroy your business, you’re playing roulette with your financial plan. The con -\ngenital danger of hitchhiking is that you relinquish control to the driver.

Why are you painting someone else’s “big picture” when \nyou should be painting your own? \nShe smiled, raised her “dream-stealer” defenses, and rejected my analysis. As \nif what she was doing was working and reasonable, her mind was closed to my \nsuggestions. That’s fine. Keep doing what you’re doing and see if that gets you \nwhere you want to go.

If you own an Internet company, \nyour habitat is worldwide. The larger the habitat, the greater the potential speed, \nor leverage, of your Fastlane.\nswing F or h ome r uns, n o T s ing Les\nBillionaire Mark Cuban recently wrote on his blog that it doesn’t matter how many \ntimes you strike out in business because you only have to be right once, and that \n“once” can set you up for life. In other words, be in the business of home runs.\nBusiness is like baseball. Play on a field where you can hit home runs; don’t \nplay on a field where they’re prohibited! For example, if you own a clothing bou-\ntique on Main Street, you violate the Commandment of Scale because your pool \nof customers is drawn from the local trading area. To break scale, the business \nowner needs to introduce leverage in the form of replication: Open more stores, \nsell franchises, or sell on the Internet.\nUnfortunately, most entrepreneurs engage in “singles-only” businesses. Their \nplaying field is stunted. Their road screams “Speed Limit: 15.” The home run is \nimpossible and their habitat shriveled. If you’re a massage therapist, you won’t \nawake one day and have 10,000 patrons outside your door. There is no leverage! \nAnd if you don’t have leverage in the Fastlane equation, you don’t have a chance! The \nCommandment of Scale is like a tollbooth on the road to the Law of Effection!\nThe Fas TLane w eaLTh e qua Tion: d isarmed\nWhen you violate the Commandment of Scale you disarm the Fastlane wealth \nequation and demote its power to Slowlane status. Recall the Fastlane wealth \nequation:\nWealth = Net Profit + Asset Value\nAsset value is predicated on net profit, which is predicated by unit profit mul -\ntiplied by units sold.\nNet Profit = Units Sold × Unit Profit\nIf “units sold” has a ceiling, you handcuff your ability to create leverage. Without \nleverage, you can’t create wealth exponentially. When you travel a business road \nincapable of scale, you render the Fastlane wealth equation impotent. \nMy favorite example is the guy who buys a popular sandwich franchise in his \nlocal neighborhood. This business violates the Commandment of Scale because \nthe variables—units sold and unit profit—are implicitly limited. How many\n\f\n234\nthe millionaire fastlane sandwiches can this guy humanly sell in one day? Fifty? A hundred? How many \nhours are in the day? Twenty-four? See the similarity? The objective of units sold is \nto have an upper limit greater than 100. How about 10,000? Or 100,000? Is there \nanything this sandwich shop owner can do to sell more sandwiches in one day? \nUnder his current structure, there isn’t. He is limited in scale to his local trading \narea. He’ll never sell a cold-cut combo to a man living in Australia, let alone the \nneighboring city. Scale is limited, causing this road to have a constricting speed \nlimit, just like a Slowlane road.\nTo make matters worse, the other end of the equation is also limited: unit profit. \nWhat is the maximum unit profit on a sandwich and drink? Two bucks? Again, \nwe are operating under a ceiling of low numbers. These numbers don’t transcend \nwealth; they limit wealth.\nNow let me clarify before you hammer me over the head: I’m not suggesting \nthat a local restaurant owner can’t get rich. In fact, I know a few restaurant owners \nwho do quite well except that they operate a different class of restaurant—upscale \nestablishments, where scale and magnitude have more reach. If your average \ndinner bill is $200 and you draw patrons from all over the city, not just the local \nneighborhood, you operate on a different scale. Unit profit isn’t $2 per sandwich, \nbut $40 per person, and with alcohol it climbs to $60. \nr each or m agni Tude = s ca Le\nTo achieve scale, magnitude or reach must increase. Magnitude is naturally increased \nwith price or cost. If you sell Lamborghinis over Hyundais, you have greater \nmagnitude simply by the implicit price of Lamborghinis. You are near Effection \n(Lamborghini owners most likely exploit the Law of Effection). If you are a real \nestate agent for the rich and sell multimillion dollar estates, you achieve magni -\ntude implicit by price. Higher prices and cost implicitly drive magnitude. If you \nsuccessfully sell the most expensive apartment building in Manhattan, you have \nhad an effect of magnitude and realize scale. If you are operating with magnitude, \nyou are near or at Effection.\nReach, exclusive of magnitude, also achieves scale. Reach is massive numbers. \nThe more people you reach, the greater scale potential. Who does your business \nserve? The local neighborhood? Or the world? The bigger your pool of play, the \nbigger your potential for wealth.\nThe guy stuck on Main Street selling sandwiches has no scale and no magni -\ntude. Is there anything this guy can do to turn his $40,000-per-year profit into \n$400,000? Nope. He’s done before he even started. He didn’t buy a franchise; he \nbought a job. He will never get rich until he wakes up and realizes that scale is not \nreached selling one-buck-margin sandwiches to 100 people a day."

Give wealth a chance! How \ndo you know if your business (or potential business) honors the Commandment \nof Scale? Ask:\n • Can the net income of this business scale limitlessly, say, from $2,000 per \nmonth to $200,000?\n • Can the asset value of this business scale into the millions? \n • Can this business impact millions? Or does it impact hundreds? Is its customer \npool the world or a small community in the city?\n • Can this business be replicated and expanded beyond the local trading area \nby franchising, chaining, or additional units?\n • Best-case scenario, what is the units-sold potential? One hundred or one hun-\ndred million? \n • Best-case scenario, how pliable is unit profit? Does it have magnitude?\nIf you can’t affirm these questions, you might be stuck in a restrictive business \nwhere wealth creation is stifled. \nTiny habitats create tiny wealth. Scale is large numbers. Think big, nationally, \nand globally. Big numbers, or scale, is the inroad to The Law of Effection. To make \nmillions, you must affect millions. That doesn’t happen in a small store on Main \nStreet, but in hundreds of stores across the country.\ndri Ve eFFec Tion’s n eighborhood\nA “wealth-seeking” friend of mine asked if I thought buying a coffee franchise \nwas a good idea. I said, “No.” My answer shocked him because he played the “be \nyour own boss” drum. I didn’t like the idea because the gateway into the Law of \nEffection was barricaded. \nThe problem? His goal was financial freedom. If this was his goal, owning a \ncoffee franchise in the local community wasn’t going to do the trick. With a cof -\nfee shop, he has no access to the Law of Effection. Selling 100 lattes a day simply \nwon’t make an impact in either scale or magnitude. And since he didn’t want to \nown 20 of these franchises, but just one, he was barricading himself from the \nLaw. Road closed. \nIf you can’t access the Law of Effection, you won’t get rich. The conduit to all \nwealth is via the Law of Effection. For the Slowlaner, the LOE has to be hit by mas-\nsive intrinsic value explosion: Sing in front of millions, entertain millions, play ball \nin front of millions. For the Fastlaner, the LOE is leveraged by scale or asset value \nexplosion: Sell millions, help millions, serve millions, impact millions.\n\f\n236\nthe millionaire fastlane Law oF  eFFec Tion b arricades\nThere are three barricades that prevent entrepreneurs from realizing the Law of \nEffection: Scale, Magnitude, and Source.\nThe strongest barricade to Effection is scale. If you can’t serve millions, you \nwon’t make millions. Returning to my friend’s coffee shop, his “units sold” variable \nwithin the Fastlane wealth equation is restricted because his cafe is confined to a \nlocal community. His sales are mathematically caged to a stiff number—scale is \nabsent. He will never sell coffee to someone in New Zealand. A business that lacks \nscale acts like a car with a speed governor that prevents acceleration.\nMy friend’s only option to break scale would be to purchase more franchises \nin more locations. If he owned 29 franchises across the state, he suddenly would \nbe serving 6,000 coffees per day. Scale becomes prevalent, and attached to scale \nis the Law of Effection. Of course, the optimum Fastlane strategy is not buying \nfranchises, but selling them. \nIf my friend doesn’t want to own multiple franchises he can’t break the barri-\ncade of scale. Without scale (units sold) or magnitude (high unit profit) he drives \na business that will produce a weak asset value. His wealth equation becomes \nretarded and the Law of Effection quarantined, remanding him to a middle-class \nwork-life existence. With a middle-class income and a weak asset valuation, he \ndefects to a wealth equation emblematic of the Slowlane.\nThe other barricade to Effection is Magnitude. Because our coffee shop owner \nis restricted in scale, his other option is scale by magnitude. Unfortunately, the \nmagnitude road is also closed. Unit profit cannot be manipulated. Every sale won’t \ngenerate a profit of greater than a few bucks and raising prices reduces units sold. \nA $100,000 profit on each coffee sold is impossible.\nWhile direct access to the Law of Effection is a foolproof road to wealth, indi -\nrect access isn’t so clear, since Effection always trickles up to owners and produc-\ners, not down to employees or consumers. For example, if you work as a doctor \nat a private-care facility, you could argue that you have magnitude and therefore, \nyou should be rich. In fact, all doctors should be rich since they have magnitude, \nright? Not exactly. The fault in this presumption is that the Law of Effection honors \nonly those in control.\nThat private health-care facility? The facility’s owner receives the full benefit of \nEffection, not the doctors he hired. The doctors on staff aren’t guaranteed access \nto Effection, because they don’t control the system. Can they be rich anyway? Sure, \nbut that decision is left to intrinsic value evaluations to be made by the owner of \nthe system. Doctors who own practices and hire other doctors get full access to \nEffection and get rich.\nEffection always is biased toward the architect of the system."

She couldn’t justify the cost, \nand the seed was inaccessible. Her road started deficient and wouldn’t grow a \nplanted seed. Had she ignored her finances and hired a general manager anyway, \nhence planting the seed, she would have discovered later that it was infertile and \nincapable of harvesting a money tree. \nThe problem with most business roads is that they are infertile breeding grounds \nfor money trees simply because they fail the Commandment of Time. The seeds \naren’t accessible and those seeds that are accessible won’t take to the soil. \nc ha PTer s ummary: Fas TLane d is Tinc Tions\n • A business attached to your time is a job.\n • A business that earns income exclusive of your time satisfies the Commandment \nof Time.\n • To satisfy the Commandment of Time, start with a business that uses a money-\nsystem seedling, or introduce one.\n\f\n242\n35\nRapid Wealth:  \nThe Interstates\nYou can’t live a perfect day without doing something  \nfor someone who will never be able to repay you.\n~ John Wooden\nThe c rossroads\nIf you want to get across the country, drive the fastest roads, not the slowest.

Having never been \ninvolved in the limo business, I figured I’d get a job in the business and learn the \nropes. After a year in the business, my opportunity—my crossroads—arrived. The \nowner of the limousine company put the company up for sale and offered it to \nme for no money down. Here was my opportunity—a chance to own a limousine \nservice! Except there was one problem. \nI was torn. Just weeks earlier, I decided to move to Phoenix and was preparing \nto move. Now this. Should I stay?

Did I want to pass on this great “no money \ndown” opportunity and forgo Phoenix? What did I do? I compiled my weighted \naverage decision matrix ( WADM) to give me clarity. Yes, I really use the stuff in \nthis book! Obviously, Phoenix won and I didn’t buy the limousine company. But \nwhat was in that decision matrix that helped me identify the right road and the \nright course of action?\nI knew the five Fastlane commandments and which roads of business had \n“Fastlane Purity” . . . and I knew the odds of implementation of both.\nFas TLane Puri Ty: Fi Ve c ommandmen Ts\nThou shalt not invest in a needless business. Thou shalt not trade time for money. \nThou shalt not operate on a limited scale. Thou shalt not relinquish control. Thou \nshalt not let a business startup be an event over process.\nWhen I analyzed the limousine service as a potential business, it wasn’t a pure \nFastlane. The operation had satisfied the control and entry criterion, but it didn’t \nhave scale; it served the northwest suburbs of Chicago. The operation didn’t have \ntime detachment; I would have had to log long hours, and the margins weren’t \nthick enough to deploy human resources. And it certainly didn’t solve an unmet \nneed; in Chicago, limo companies were a dime a dozen.\nTo “Fastlane” the business, it would have required a lot of time, effort, and \nmoney. Deep down, I knew that I wanted to be involved in a business that was \npure Fastlane from the start, not one that needed to be molded. The purest \nFastlanes have the best wealth potential, and I knew it. When you grace the Law \nof Effection, money moves your way.

    "raw_text": "244\nthe millionaire fastlane Potent Fastlane #1: The i nternet\nThe most potent interstate is an Internet business. The Internet has made more \nmillionaires in the last decade than any other medium out there. The Internet \nhas, and is, destroying old hard-line industries such as travel agents, stockbrokers, \nnewspapers, and magazines. The Internet is the shark of the Fastlane. \nThe Internet is where I found my fortune and it is one reason why I declined \nmy opportunity to own a limousine company. The Internet is the best Fastlane \navailable, because it immediately obeys the Five Commandments to the Fastlane, \nassuming a need-based premise. It naturally scales to a worldwide audience, it \nsystematizes to automation via computer systems, it is a medium you can control \n(unfortunately, most don’t), and its barriers are still strong enough to prevent \n“everyone” from entry. \nInternet business models (roads) fall into seven broad categories:\n1) s ubscription-based\nOffer users access to data, information, or software, and charge a monthly \nfee. Data can be leads, sales information, a proprietary database, or good old-\nfashioned pornography. When 10,000 people pay you $9.95 per month for \nyour information, you’re balling the Fastlane! \nWhen I owned my company, I paid for many Web services, all subscription-\nbased. From data analytics (who is visiting my site?) to affiliate management \n(who wants to offer my service?). One particular company ran a Web-site-\nmonitoring service that kept track of Web site uptime. On its home page it \nadvertised how many clients it monitored. At the time, it listed “20,000 clients \nserved,” and I was paying $50 per month for service. Assuming my fee was \naverage, 20,000 × $50 = $1,000,000 in gross revenue— PER MONTH. This is \na perfect example of an Internet business system in which the business is the \nsystem. No products. No shipping. No headaches. I’d speculate that this Web \nsite enjoys margins of 75% and nets in the $750,000 range, per month. How \nquickly would you become a millionaire earning $750,000/month? Or, would \nyou rather save $200/month from your $45 K/year salary? The disparaging \nfield of play is laughable. \nExamples of subscription sites are RealtyTrac.com and LoopNet.com. \n2) c ontent-based\nContent-based models are online news magazines and blogs that disseminate \ninformation to a particular niche or industry. These services provide content \nfor free consumption and sell advertising to parties who want to reach those \neyeballs. My Fastlane Forum can be considered a content-based revenue model. \nI consider content-based revenue models the most difficult for success because \nentry barriers have significantly declined and its success is predicated on high\n\f\n245\npART 7 — THE RoAds To wEAlTHtraffic. Also, content systems heavily engage in affiliate programs, which is a \nhitchhiking structure.\n3) Lead generation\nLead generation services often provide a service to consumers while simulta -\nneously aggregating a non-homogeneous industry. This is what I did for the \nlimousine industry. I pooled a highly fragmented industry into one centralized \nsource, brought consumers into the mix, and sold that consumer information \nto limo companies. Lead generation is popular with fragmented industries, \nwhere the industry players consist of mostly small to medium-sized busi -\nnesses. Lead generation in the airline business probably wouldn’t work while \nlead generation for plastic surgeons would. Lead generation solves two needs: \n1) The consumer’s desire to save time and money and 2) The business owner’s \nneed to find new customers inexpensively.\n4) s ocial n etworks\nSocial networks are spin-offs of content systems. Instead of pooling content \nfor eyeballs, people are pulled into groups, or tribes. Facebook started off as \na pool for college-aged students and evolved into a generic social network for \nall ages. MySpace targets the high school crowd. LinkedIn hits the upwardly \nmobile professional. Social networks are mere aggregators of like-minded \ncommunities, from mystery novel writers to gear heads who like to rebuild \nengines on the weekend.\n5) b rokerage systems\nBrokers bring buyers and sellers together and facilitate transactions. They are \nmarket-makers for a particular industry and earn money typically on each \ntransaction. Examples of known brokers are PayPal, Elance, CarsDirect, and \nTravelocity.com.\n6) a dvertising\nSimilar to brokerages, advertisers merge buyers and sellers together and accept \nadvertising fees in lieu of transaction fees. For example, I owned a Web site that \nlisted limousines for sale. The site accepted advertising fees for each limousine \nplaced for sale. I introduced buyers and sellers. Some services leverage both \nbrokerage and advertising together, such as eBay. Search engines like Google \nand Yahoo operate both advertising and brokerage models. \n7) e -commerce\nE-commerce is the act of selling goods, services, and information over the \nInternet. Amazon.com, CSNStores.com are examples of large-scale e-commerce\n\f\n246\nthe millionaire fastlane providers. However, many small local stores have expanded and created scale \nwith the e-commerce model. In my backyard, I have 24 solar lights that I bought \nonline from a small retailer in Minnesota that operates an e-commerce store. \nJust years ago, that store was local with no scale—now with an e-commerce pres-\nence, they are worldwide and are selling products to retired farts in Phoenix. \nE-commerce also can be information. E-books are the most popular form \nof information distribution on the Internet. When I sell my book in e-book \nform on the Internet, I’m engaged in e-commerce. I can sell books out of my \ntrunk by sitting in the parking lot at Arizona State University, or I can set up \na Web site and sell books to folks in Europe.\nWhen you look at the Internet as a Fastlane road, it is immensely powerful \nwhen examined against our Fastlane Wealth Equation.\nWealth = Net Profit + Asset Value\nWithin the units sold variable (within net income), the world becomes \nyour upper limit when dealing on the Internet. Additionally, asset value, a \ncomponent of the Fastlane wealth equation, is not only determined by net \nincome, but by traffic metrics. Many Web sites are sold for billions and don’t \nhave a penny of profit. Traffic, or visitors to a Web site, also has a boundless \nupside scale. The Fastlane variables of net profit and asset value have a virtu -\nally limitless upside.\nPotent Fastlane #2: i nnovation\nInnovation is another broad stroke of Fastlane purity and encompasses many roads. \nIt is the good old-fashioned way to get rich: Invent a product, service, or piece of \ninformation, manufacture it, and then distribute it. \nInnovation covers any act of creation followed by distribution. Let me repeat \nthat: Innovation involves two acts: 1) Manufacture and 2) Distribution.\nInvent a product, then sell it by infomercial, sell it on the Internet, sell it on QVC, \nsell through 10,000 network marketing distributors, or sell it to 20 wholesalers \nthat then sell it to 20,000 retailers. What is the product of innovation? Virtually \nanything that solves a need or fulfills a desire.\n • Food (beer, barbecue sauce, cookies, secret recipes)\n • Household (robots that vacuum, tools, hangers)\n • Health and vitality (vitamins, herbs, energy drinks, bars, “male enhancement \nformulas”)\n • Information (books, magazines, subscription newsletters)\n • Personal (clothing, purses, shoes, gloves)\n • Automotive (accessories, add-ons, stick-ons)"

    "raw_text": "247\npART 7 — THE RoAds To wEAlTHInventing is still recognized as the default get-rich-quick method out there, \nand yes, it is alive and well. However, don’t be fooled. Inventing isn’t really about \ninventing the vehicle, the telephone, or the goofy Segway—the core activity of \ninventors is just taking something and improving or modifying it. Take some -\nthing old and stale and make it better. Take an underexposed product, make it \nyour own, and reintroduce it to the world. Take something unconventional and \nmake it conventional. \nOn TV, I watched a successful entrepreneur interview in which the inventor \nsimply repackaged vodka from boring old clear bottles to colorful bottles with \nrazzle-dazzle. In fact, for my birthday I received a skull-shaped bottle of vodka. \nVodka has been around for centuries, yet an entrepreneur took a stale product and \nadded an element of uniqueness and differentiation. Sometimes it’s that simple. \nMy favorite example is the Snuggie, an oversized mass-marketed blanket \nwith arms. The product concept has been around for years, but they took the \nconcept, repackaged it, remarketed it, and wham, 40 million sold later, they had \na blockbuster.\nInnovation is a dual challenged process: manufacture and distribution. Inventing \na product that solves a need is half the battle; the other half is getting your inven -\ntion into the hands of millions, which involves a variety of distribution channels: \ninfomercial (sell via mass media), retail (sell to distributors and wholesalers), and \ndirect marketing (sell via print media, postal mail, Internet).\nFor example, when I wrote this book, I was the means of manufacture. I wrote \nit, put it together, edited it, and had it physically published. I manufactured it. \nI engaged in innovation. However, like all innovation roads, manufacture is one \ntiny battle in a larger war. Distribution is where the war is won. A great product \nis worthless if it doesn’t get into the hands of people, and that requires distribu -\ntion. For my book, I will need to leverage Amazon (a distribution system), book \ndistributors (wholesalers), and the Internet (another distribution system) if I am \nto succeed.\nYes, your product invention can be something you invent yet is manufactured \nin China, or an e-book you write in a weekend. Innovation—from books to prod -\nucts—is Fastlane. Have you ever wondered why people sell get-rich-quick books \nand yet the content is just regurgitated blather from 30 prior books? The authors \nknow that authoring is a potent Fastlane. \nThe challenge of any authoring Fastlane is never the book or the words them -\nselves. Some of the greatest books in the world go unread, while the mediocre stuff \nsells millions. The difference lies in marketing, public relations, and just good old-\nfashioned business know-how. Writing a book is not a business; selling the book is. \nIf I’m obsessively intent on selling this book to millions, I have to manufacture, \nthen distribute. I have to sell, market, promote, appear, speak, interview, and write; \nI have to invest in the business of distribution. To leverage the Fastlane wealth"

Iteration is: “the means \nor act of repeating a process, usually with the aim of approaching a desired goal \nor target or result.”\nIntentional iteration is a potent Fastlane but it offers the greatest challenge \nbecause it really doesn’t satisfy all five commandments, but four. The process of \nintentional iteration is the act of satisfying the final commandment, scale. Scale \nis achieved either through human resource systems or repeated successes. \nFor example, when a real estate investor buys a single-family home at a bank \nauction and later rents it out, there is no scale, and with that one act, nothing can \ncreate scale. The investor has little wiggle room in his Fastlane wealth equation: \nNet income is derived from rent and asset value is derived by the home’s market \nvalue. \nTo solve that challenge, the investor engages in II and repeats the process. \nInstead of buying one home, he buys 50. Yes, easier said than done, and it can \nbe incredibly slow. In effect, the investor has chosen to play on a field of “singles,” \nand to hit the home run, II needs to become the strategy. Iteration is a profitable, \nsingles-based business scaled to home runs.\nFranchising is another example of II.\nIf you build a small store with the goal of intentional iteration, your goal isn’t \none store, but hundreds, perhaps thousands, through the act of chaining or fran -\nchising. The intentional iterator goes into business to cookie-cut his system across \nmany successes. A small store often starts out as a violation of four commandments \nbut can quickly transfigure into a full-fledged Fastlane venture with iteration. The \nFastlane franchising premise is to build a local business defined by systematic \nprocesses, then franchise the concept nationally or worldwide. The iterator’s goal \nis to replicate and sell a concept, a brand, and a system and remove himself from \noperations. While your little deli might not be particularly Fastlane it could be \nturned Fastlane by the process of II, through franchise or chaining replication.\nA popular thread at my forum is titled “Is a candy kiosk Fastlane?” A forum \nuser wanted to know if having automated candy kiosks in the mall constitutes a \nFastlane plan. As a standalone, no. But with II? Fastlane baby! One kiosk in one \nmall isn’t going to make you rich because it’s a singles-based business. However, \n200 kiosks in 50 malls might, because it creates net income, scales asset value, \nand makes a bigger impact of magnitude. Intentional iteration is the Fastlaner’s \nresponse to limited scale.\n\f\n249\npART 7 — THE RoAds To wEAlTHc ha PTer s ummary: Fas TLane d is Tinc Tions\n • The best Fastlanes satisfy all five Commandments: Control, Entry, Need, Time, \nand Scale.\n • Assuming a need-based premise, the Internet is the fastest interstate, because \nit overwhelmingly satisfies all Commandments. \n • Innovation can be any variety of open roads: authoring, inventing, or \nservices. \n • Inventing success needs coupling with distribution.\n • A singles-based business is scaled to a home-run business by intentional itera-\ntion. With iteration, scale is conquered.\n\f\n250\n36\nFind Your  \nOpen Road\nAt first, people refuse to believe that a strange new thing can be done,  \nthen they begin to hope it can be done, then they see it can be done— \nthen it is done, and all the world wonders  \nwhy it was not done centuries ago.\n~ Frances Hodgson Burnett\nn eeds, i deas, oPP or Tuni Ty, and T he oP en r oad\nOpportunities, and the open roads they represent, are everywhere. Look around. \nThat person complaining at the store counter. Opportunity. That stupid voicemail \nmaze you hate navigating when you call the bank. Opportunity. That unsold \nhouse that languishes on the market. Opportunity. That trash on the side of the \nroad. Opportunity. The rotting salad that lasted only two days in the refrigerator. \nOpportunity. Those people bitching on that online forum. Opportunity.\nIf you can’t see the opportunities that surround you every day, you haven’t tuned \nyour Fastlane frequency to them. When you make a few minor mental adjustments, \nroads seemingly closed are suddenly opened. Many entrepreneurs misinterpret \nopportunity because they associate opportunity with breakthrough, legendary \nideas. They seek virgin ideas, perfect and new; ones that would be unveiled to the \nworld in grandiose events. Rarely does that happen.\nOpportunity is rarely about some blockbuster breakthrough like the light bulb or \nthe car, but as simple as an unmet need, or a need not met adequately. Opportunity \nis a solution to an inconvenience. Opportunity is simplification. Opportunity is \na feeling. Opportunity is comfort. Opportunity is better service. Opportunity is \nfixing pain. Opportunity is putting weak companies out of business."

My mind is tuned because I see the terrain of opportunity through \naccustomed senses. I see and hear what most people don’t. How can you tune \nyour eyes and ears to the same attuned frequency? With a little practice, it’s easy.\nOpen roads, needs and opportunity come prefaced with “code words” or phrases \nthat scream “This is an opportunity!” When you catch yourself (or someone else) \nin these words, you’ve just uncovered a possible opportunity. Here are the most \ncommon phrases:\n“I hate . . .” \nWhat do you hate? Solve the hate, and there’s your open road.\n“I don’t like . . .” \nWhat don’t you like?

A white shirt plus spaghetti and forget it. Aside \nfrom the slop, I have a nasty knack of biting my lip on the inside of my mouth. \nWhen I bite myself, a canker sore forms every time. I’ve had canker sore issues \nsince grade school. They’re not problematic unless I accidentally bite my lip or \nmouth. The last canker sore I had lasted a week and was excruciatingly painful. \n“I’m tired of these canker sores!” I bellyached. Notice the language “I’m tired . . .” \nRing ring, opportunity! \nMy discomfort led me to the Internet for canker sore research. I found some \nconflicting conjecture and information on how to prevent them. Some people rec-\nommended Vitamin X while others recommended Herb Y. (Vitamin X and Herb Y \nis not the real name because I’m protecting my formula!) So, I bought Vitamin X \nand Herb Y and waited until my next chewing mistake. \nThen it happened. While eating some oatmeal, I bit my lip. A few days later \nI felt a canker sore brewing at the bite location. I loaded up on Vitamin X and \nHerb Y. Remarkably, the canker sore never formed, and it appeared that Vitamin X \nand Herb Y worked as a canker sore preventive. Now, anytime I feel a canker sore \nbrewing from an earlier bite wound, I repeat this process, and each time, the sore \ndoes not form. I haven’t had a canker sore in nearly two years! I went from one \nevery other month to none. \nMy opportunity is clear. I could market my special “canker formula” to the \nmasses. I have control, decent entry barriers, scale, and time.

    "raw_text": "258\nthe millionaire fastlane For your business system target, multiply your Gross Living Cost by 5.\nBusiness System Target = ($14,000 × 5) = $70,000/mo.\nThese are your two targets. First, seek to create a business system that generates \n$70,000/month in passive monthly income. Of this income, 40% goes to taxes, \n40% goes to fund your money system, and 20% pays your lifestyle. This delivers \nyour target lifestyle AND simultaneously funds your money system. The other \ntarget is your passive income from a lump-sum money system. To enjoy your des-\nignated lifestyle supported by a money system, your target number is $5,599,920. \nFive percent interest on this amount is roughly $23,000 monthly, which covers \nlifestyle and taxes. \nThis dual-flanked attack builds a passive income stream from a business that \nfunds a money system. The result is like warping the destination to you. You can \nexperience retirement without being retired. For example, my Web business rou -\ntinely earned $100,000 per month, month after month. Yet, in those instances, \nI didn’t have $20,000,000 lying around, but the lifestyle was an option because \nmy business system cash-flowed the equivalent of that lump sum . Excess income \nfunded my money system. Then, later, I liquidated the asset to arrive at my “money-\nsystem” number. If your business system generates passive income, you can use it \nto fund your lifestyle and your money system simultaneously. \nstep 4: make it r eal\nGet started today by looking three feet in front of you, not three miles. A long \ngaze at the mountain crest will overwhelm you, so stop looking at it. The key to \nachieving enormous tasks is to break them down into their smallest parts. You \ncan’t run a 26-mile marathon by focusing on the 26th mile. You attack the first, \nthen the second, third, and so forth. \nI see this repeated at the Fastlane forum (TheFastlaneForum.com): “I’d like \nto make $5,000/month; how do I do this?” Aside from the flawed “money chas -\ning” logic, the first step is to make $50/month. You can’t make $5,000 per month \nuntil you learn how to make $50 per month! It’s amazing how people love to skip \nprocess and want events. \nTo start your money system, find a quarter and drop it into a coffee can. \nCongratulations, you are 25 steps closer to your goal. No, I’m not kidding. Your \ngoal isn’t 5,600,000 dollars but 560,000,000 pennies. Drop your loose change \ninto your can at the end of each day. Find 60 cents there, 25 cents there, 115 cents \nthere; it adds up and, albeit small, you move closer to your goal daily. Ridiculous? \nNope, this is how I started, and yes, I still practice this today because this exercise \nhas three conditioning purposes.\nFirst, when you drop change into your bucket daily, you train yourself to\n\f\n259\npART 7 — THE RoAds To wEAlTHvisualize your goal moving closer. You get a daily reminder. Certainly you won’t \naccumulate 560 million pennies in this fashion, but the objective is repetitive \nprogress toward a seemingly distant goal. Second, it forces you to evaluate: Have \nyou applied pressure to that goal, or is your change bucket the only weapon in \nyour arsenal? Are you pursuing a Fastlane business or still confined to a job? The \nthird purpose is to change your relationship with money. If you are serious about a \nmoney system, you’re going to need a big shift in your beliefs about money. What \nis money to you? A medium to get the latest World of Warcraft release? Or the \nsoldiers for your army of freedom fighters?\nThe final step is to fund your money system at a brokerage firm. Designate an \naccount that represents your money system. Typically, most brokerage accounts \nrequire a minimum $1,000 deposit. If you already have an account, pick an income \nfund that yields at least 5% yearly and move the funds there. Or alternatively, you \ncan open a trading account and leverage cheaper and regularly traded Exchange \nTraded Funds (ETFs) instead of a traditional mutual fund. Here are the brokerage \nhouses I recommend to fund your actual account.\n1)  Fidelity (Fidelity.com/1-800- FIDELITY )\n2) Vanguard (Vanguard.com/1-877-662-7447 )\n3) T. Rowe Price (TRowePrice.com/1-800-638-5660 )\n4)  TDAmeritrade (TDAmeritrade.com/1-800-454-9272)\nIf you don’t have $1,000 to fund the account, you can do it once you hit the \n$1,000 milestone. Your change bucket should yield about $500 per year. With an \nactual account, you can witness the real-time passivity of your money system. If \nyou have $50,000 in your passive money system (not leveraged in a Fastlane pur -\nsuit) you can literally see your passive income stream every month in the form of \neither interest or dividends. For example, if you invested in a world bond fund for \nyour money system and it yielded 6.5%, from $50,000 you’d generate $270 per \nmonth in passive income, each and every month. \nNow, I reiterate, Fastlane wealth is created by the net income and asset value—\nnot by the stock market or compound interest. Your Fastlane business should fund \nthis account, not savings from your paycheck. \nThe r u Les o F The r oad: Financia L Li Teracy\nAfter my sister turned 21, she bought her first new car—a Nissan Pulsar. It was her \nfirst mistake in the world of finance and my first exposure to the world of financial \nilliteracy. My sister had trouble making the car payments, and when I asked to \nread her loan documents, I was floored. I investigated. I asked, “How did you buy \nthis car? How did you negotiate?” \nShe replied, “I told the dealer I wanted a payment of $399 per month.”"

Remember, more money doesn’t solve money \nproblems. If not educating yourself after graduation is one step on the Sidewalk, \nthe other is not educating yourself on basic finance and economics.\nThe world is full of financial illiterates; they’ve failed driver’s education and \ndon’t know the rules of the road. As kids, we aren’t taught money management \nor basic financial discipline. We’re abandoned in a financial jungle swarming \nwith predators. Many perfectly intelligent people lack rudimentary knowledge of \nbasic financial concepts such as:\n • Interest rates\n • Taxable and non-taxable yields\n • Amortization of mortgages\n • The balancing of a check book\n • Basic percentage calculations\n • Calculating return on investment\n • Why stocks rise and fall\n • Why a guaranteed 15% return on a bank CD  is screaming, “scam!”\n • How stock options work, such as calls and puts\n • Why insurance exists\n • How a mutual fund works\n • What bonds are and how they rise and fall\n • Global currency\nTo successfully leverage a money system for passivity, you have to familiarize \nyourself with financial instruments that fuel the money system. Do you know how \nto calculate simple interest? Return on investment? Do you know what happens \nto the price of a bond when interest rates go up? Can you figure out the difference \nbetween a tax-free yield and a taxable yield? These concepts harden your road to \nwealth. Financial illiterates can’t manage money systems.

But is it Fastlane relevant? Absolutely, with one distinction: \nLive below your means with the intent to expand your means. \n“Live below your means” is relevant at any income level. The key variable is \nthe word “means.” If Bill earns $50,000 and Jack earns $1 million, who has the \ngreater means? Who will live the extravagant lifestyle? Both might be living “within \ntheir means,” but Jack has a drastically different lifestyle. Remember,  Slowlaners \nseek to minimize expenses while the Fastlaner seeks to maximize income and asset \nvalues. \nYou can live richly and still live below your means, but for Fastlaners it’s a big \nchallenge because we get paid first, not last. Tax bills come long after the income \nis earned, and “live below your means” requires above-average discipline. \na Financia L a dViser d oesn’ T Fi X iLL iTeracy\nI am my own financial adviser because I don’t like losing control. Hiring a financial \nadviser might make sense to you aside from one caveat: Hiring a financial adviser \ndoesn’t fix financial illiteracy. Yes, just because you had salad for lunch, it doesn’t \nmean you can eat doughnuts for dinner. If you hire a financial adviser, you need \ncompetency to assess his advisement. Is your adviser advising a bond in a rising \ninterest rate environment? Is your adviser advising treasuries when they are over-\nbought? Is your adviser advising an investment that seems “too good to be true?” \nLiteracy gives you the power to evaluate your adviser’s advice.\nIn October 2009, actor Nicolas Cage, who reportedly earned more than $40 \nmillion in 2008, sued his former business manager for $20 million, accusing him \nof poor advisement and leading him down a path toward financial ruin. Cage con-\ntended that his manager exposed him to a basket of risky investments resulting \nin catastrophic losses. In a countersuit filed later, Cage’s former business manager \nblamed “lavish spending” on Cage’s financial difficulties—not his advice. Whatever \nthe truth, if you can’t audit your adviser, you don’t have control. If you can’t cri-\ntique good advice from bad you don’t have control. For those who hire financial \nplanners, literacy is insurance. Financial advisers do not solve financial illiteracy \njust as more money doesn’t solve poor money management.\nFinancial illiteracy exposes you to risk, and in the worst case scenario, fraud. \nBernard Madoff’s investment fund defrauded thousands, and billions were lost, \nbut what’s more shocking is that the whistle was blown years before. You see,\n\f\nwhen you are financially illiterate, you are deaf, and when you are deaf, you can’t \nhear the whistle.\nc ha PTer s ummary: Fas TLane d is Tinc Tions\n • The Fastlane is the means to your end because dreams cost money.\n • Conquer big goals by breaking them down to their smallest component.\n • Daily saving reinforces your relationship with money; it is your passive system \nthat buys freedom and another soldier added to your army.\n • A money system isn’t used to grow wealth but to grow income. Growing wealth \nshould be left to your Fastlane road.\n • You will struggle to build a financial empire if you are financially illiterate.\n • “Live below your means” is relevant at any income level.\n • For the Fastlaner, “Live below your means” means to expand your means. \n • A financial adviser doesn’t solve financial illiteracy and literacy is insurance.\n • Financial illiteracy dilutes your control, especially when evaluating the advice \nof a financial adviser."

Speed \nis turning off the Playstation.\nChess is a complex game with complex maneuvers, and your business must be \nrun similarly. Unfortunately, most business owners approach business one-dimen-\nsionally, like a game of checkers, and doing so puts the owner into a winless game. \nCheckers is one-dimensional because all the pieces move identically, while chess \nis multi-dimensional because each piece moves differently with different roles. \nThe business owner who plays checkers has one offensive and defensive play \nin the playbook: price. Raise prices, lower prices, cut costs, cheaper suppliers: “Oh \nLord, how can I be the cheapest so everyone buys from me?” This one-dimensional \nattack throws entrepreneurs into cyclical bidding wars, marginalizing their offers \nwith one goal in mind: To be the cheapest.\nIn the limo industry, price wars dominated because owners commoditized \ntheir brands to a one-dimensional attack: “If my offer is the cheapest, I will book \nmore business.”\nYour success requires a shift from this one-dimensional approach to a multi-\ndimensional attack.

It accomplishes nothing and its purpose is untapped. Execution \nis making an idea real and giving the battery a charge. Execution is taking that \nLamborghini out of the garage and slamming the accelerator to the floor, with the \nwind giving you a temporary face-lift. Execution is getting that idea out of your \nmind on onto the roads of possibility. \nEntrepreneurs struggle to differentiate between idea and execution.

What separates you from them? They executed. \nYou didn’t, and you did nothing. Instead, you spent hours playing fantasy football. \nYou spent the morning sleeping. You spent five days at a job. You chose everything \nbut that great idea. You see, ideas are nothing but a chemical reaction in your brain. \nIt’s an event that requires little effort. An idea is the event, while the execution is the \nprocess.

I love how idea conjurers protect their ideas \nwith great stewardship, careful to ensure they don’t get into the hands of would \nbe thieves, not knowing that their ideas are already shared by hundreds of others. \nThe owner of an idea is not he who imagines it, but he who executes it. \nAccording to entrepreneur Derek Sivers (Sivers.org) ideas are just multipliers \nwhile execution represents actual money. Within our Fastlane chess game, ideas \n(pawns) are potential speed, while execution (the king) is the pressure applied to \nthe accelerator. This relationship demonstrates how the coupling of a great idea \n(potential speed/strong pawns) is worthless when attached to weak execution (no \nacceleration pressure/weak king).\nThe Pawn: idea (Potential Top speed)\nAwful idea = 1 mph\nWeak idea = 5 mph\nSo-so idea = 35 mph\nGood idea = 65 mph\nGreat idea = 100 mph\nBrilliant idea = 200 mph\nThe king: execution (accelerator Pressure)\nNo execution = $1\nWeak execution = $1,000\nSo-so execution = $10,000\nGood execution = $100,000\nGreat execution = $1,000,000\nBrilliant execution = $10,000,000\nIf you notice, a brilliant idea and no execution are worth all of 200 bucks. \nAwesome potential speed (idea) is married to weak accelerator pressure (execution). \nYet a so-so idea with brilliant execution could be worth $350 million. You see, it \nisn’t about your ideas and their potential speed, but about your execution!\nWhen I started my Web business, several other companies already had estab -\nlished Web sites. Instead of reasoning, “Someone is already doing it,” I executed \nbetter and became the leader in my industry. Was my idea spectacular? No. It was \nan OK idea, but I executed better than the competition. After my revenue model \nbecame successful and copied unmercifully, did my business decline and fail? No, \nbecause the idea wasn’t the lynchpin to success, it was execution . Competitors"

Execution is \ntaking the neurological flatulence that is an idea and making it smell like a rose . \nSeriously, think about what I’ve been saying throughout this whole book: Why \nis execution so difficult, while ideas are so routine? Once again, we return to our \nwealth dichotomy: Event versus process. Execution takes process: effort, sacrifice, \ndiscipline, and persistence. Ideas are just events. \nIf you need to travel 6 million miles and you move at 15 mph, you will get there \nin 45 years. This represents the Slowlane. If you move at 95 mph, you get there in \nseven years. This is the Fastlane. The business of speed is execution.

My site’s bounce rate (people who visit one page and \nimmediately leave) skyrocketed. My conversion rate plummeted to virtually noth-\ning. I went from 1,200 leads per day to barely 500.\nThe tribe had spoken. Despite my investment in that redesign, I immediately \nreverted back to the old version and trashed six weeks of work. My golden child \nwas a golden failure. The world heralded a sign, I read it, and then reacted. \nYou see, the world tells you which direction you should be going at all times . \nHeed the signs. How do you get the world to tell you? Put your executed ideas and \nconcepts out into the world and let it tell you. Paint the world with your brush of \ngenius so they can tell you how right or wrong you are. \nPut your executed ideas out into the box.\ndead c o LLege Pro Fessors r o LL oV er\nThe world doesn’t care about ideas; it only reacts to them. This simple fact pokes \na hole in one of the sturdiest institutions of business practice—business plans. \nAcademia will be outraged at the atrocity. Be prepared for the ultimate business \nsacrilege: Business plans are useless. Yes, I said it. Business plans are useless because \nthey’re ideas jacked-up on steroids.\nUnless you count a barbecue-stained Hooters napkin, I never had a business \nplan. In fact, the best business plans are ad-hoc scribbles on napkins, old Arby’s bags, \nBaby Ruth wrappers, and voice memos on your iPhone. The problem with business \nplans is that they are another manifestation of potential speed. Like supercharged \ngarage queens, they aren’t any more powerful than the lawnmowers that sit next \nto them. Business plans are useless until they are married to execution.\nAnd guess what happens then? The moment you execute, the world will tell \nyou just what I told you: Your business plan is useless. The market (the world) will \nsteer your business in unimaginable places that will violate everything about your \nbusiness plan. If you interview any entrepreneur who has been in business longer \nthan five years, they’ll tell you that they started off with intention A and ended \nup at intention B. They sell product X and ultimately end up selling product Y. \nThe world tells you where you should be going, and no, the world doesn’t give two \npence about your 150-page PowerPoint business plan.\nFacebook started as a college-crowd social network. It morphed from a niche \nsite into a mass-market social network that serves every generation. I started \nmy Web site as a directory, and it transformed into a lead-generation portal. The \nworld has the incorrigible power to corrupt business plans the moment the idea \nis transformed to reality.\nHowever, this does not exempt financial analysis. A blind jump into a busi -\nness without knowing the specific financial constraints that govern that business \nwould be foolhardy. When I made the decision to create a limousine Web site over\n\f\n272\nthe millionaire fastlane a limousine company, I did a financial analysis. However, I didn’t get entangled \nin the intricacies and paralysis of planning, which is no substitute for execution. \nFigure out what needs figuring and just go do it . The world will do its job and tell \nyou the directions to travel.\nbu T i w an T Ven Ture c aPiTaL!\nI know I know: I can hear the objections already. Without a business plan, how \nwill you get venture capital? Or investors? You can’t. Without a business plan, you \nwon’t get funding. But please, take heart, the issue isn’t your business plan nor will \nit ever be your business plan.\nThe best business plan in the world will always be a track record of execution.\nIf you are a seasoned executor, suddenly people will want to see your business \nplan because they know you have the fortitude to execute. If I received a business \nplan from an entrepreneur who sold his company for $20 million just two years \nearlier, you can bet your sevens I’d read it. The value is not the plan, but the person \ngiving it and his track record of execution.\nToday, I know a circle of people who would read my business plan if I gave \nthem one. They know I have a track record of execution that validates the business \nplan. If you don’t have a track record of execution, the business plan is a worthless \npiece of Kinkos-bound pulp.\ng eT Funded wi Th eX ecu Tion, no T wi Th b usiness P Lans\nI started my company on a shoestring and 900 bucks. No investors, no funding, \nand no help. The fact is, had I wasted 150 hours on a 95-page business plan, no \none would have read it because I was unseasoned: I had no money, no track record, \nno races entered, no finishes, and no races won. However, as I built and grew my \nbusiness, something miraculous happened. As my ideas crystallized into tangible \nassets that could be consumed by the world, suddenly I became the approachable \nasset. Venture capitalists and angel investors called me—I didn’t call them. Suddenly, \npeople wanted to see my business plan. Why the sudden change of heart? Wasn’t \nI the same guy just years earlier? Sure, but instead of an idea on paper, I had a \ntangible concept that reflected execution.\nA common question on the Fastlane Forum is “How can I find investors for \nmy idea?” It doesn’t matter if the idea is an invention or a great new Web site, my \nanswer is never what these people want to hear. If you want investors, get out and \nexecute. Create a prototype. Create a brand. Create a track record that others can \nsee or touch. Dive into process. When you have a physical manifestation of an \nidea, investors will open their wallets. Heck, be good enough and they will be \nfighting to give you money. \nYou see, when you have nothing except 120 pages of text, charts, and graphs, \nthat shows organizational skills, not execution.

They are the \n“go-to” guys of life’s problems. Yet when it comes to your business, who is your \ngo-to guy? Who is on the frontline with your customers? The bishop in business’s \nchess match is your customer service, and how you treat the people who buy your \nproduct or service. The objective of customer service in any business should serve \none function, similar to our men of the cloth, and that is to help, support, and \nresolve.\nmy i n Terna L r oadma P: my bL ack b ook\nThe Fastlane roadmap was my compass for wealth, but I also had an internal road-\nmap, and no, it wasn’t my business plan. It was my little black book. Nope, my \nblack book wasn’t a treasure trove of telephone numbers from female hotties but \na written record of all complaints, grievances, and issues my business experienced \ndaily. This book has served as my guide for over a decade. \nWhen business owners hear a complaint, most of them ignore it. Most of \nthem pass the buck to an employee and pray the issue goes away. Not in the \nFastlane. Complaints are a beautiful thing. They represent free feedback and expose \nunmet needs in your business. They represent the journey’s road noise.\nI logged my customers’ complaints because they provided a kaleidoscope into\n\f\n275\npART 8 — youR speed: AcceleRATe weAlThthe mind of my customers. One complaint meant there were 10 others who felt the \nsame way. When my black book accumulated similar complaints weekly, I had to \nevaluate the issue and take corrective action. Complaints are the world’s whispers \nhinting the direction you should be moving.\nThe Four Ty Pes o F r oad n oise ( c om PLain Ts)\nWhen the world unleashes its opinion on your new Web site, product, or concept, \nwhat should you expect? What should be addressed and what should be ignored? \nThere are four types of complaints: 1) Complaints of change 2) Complaints of \nexpectation 3) Complaints of void and 4) Complaints of fraud.\nc omplaints of c hange\nTake anything that people love, change it, and you’ll have a riot at the steps of your \nbusiness. Remember when Coke changed its formula? Oh heavens! How dare they! \nRemember when Fox canceled the feel-good family drama Party of Five ? Dear \nGod! The world hates change, and it’s a natural human behavior to resist change. \nChange endangers comfort, expectancy, and security. \nWhen I redesigned my Web site and hundreds of complaints poured in, \nI expected a certain degree of resistance. It’s normal. In fact, every redesign I’ve \never done in 10-plus years was met with resistance. The question for critique was, \nhow much was normal? And how much was legitimate?\nComplaints of change are the least informative and therefore are the ones most \ndifficult to decipher. For my redesign failure, data confirmed that the complaints \nwere substantial. Bounce rates tripled and my conversion ratio suffered. I had to \nsuck up the failure, revert back, and start over. When you change, there will be \ncomplaints. Guaranteed. And yes, not all of them are actionable simply because \nhuman psychology is in play, not the integrity of your work. \nc omplaints of expectation\nComplaints of expectation occur when you negatively violate the expectation of \nyour customer. You convince them to do business with you, they expect something, \nand what you provide doesn’t meet that expectation. This happens because either \nyour service failed or their expectation was malformed by a deceptive marketing \nstrategy. Regardless of which, both expose a problem. And it’s your problem, not \nthe customer’s. You either need to do a better job in fulfillment or a better job in \nmanaging their expectations.\n“Your service sucks.” I heard that complaint hundreds of times and yet my \ncompany not only survived, it thrived. If my service sucked and I was being told \nit sucked, how did my business succeed? I dug into the claims.\nAdvertisers who complained, “Your service sucks,” didn’t use my service as \nintended. Their expectations were malformed. I owned a lead generation service\n\f\n276\nthe millionaire fastlane that sent email leads to clients. The thing about leads is they must be followed. You \ndon’t book leads after they sit in your email box for three weeks and then answer \nthem like a first-grader. You don’t book leads when you log in to your account once \nevery millennium. Yes indeed, my service sucks when it isn’t used properly. \nInstead of targeting my customer, I sought to better manage expectations. \nI made it abundantly clear that leads are only as good as the person following \nthem. Unfollowed leads go unbooked. Also, because most of my customers weren’t \ncommunicatively savvy, I launched educational campaigns to ensure professional \nresponses. If I couldn’t manage the complaints, I could manage the expectations. \nI knew if my customers were making money, they’d keep paying me.\nWhen you order sea bass at a restaurant and it’s served raw, your expectation \nof a well-cooked meal is violated. You complain. Yet, for the owner there is a big-\nger problem: Why was it raw? Is the chef incompetent? Does the kitchen process \nneed a retooling? Complaints of expectation expose operational issues, marketing \nmisinformation, and/or product problems.\nIf you hire a home remodeler who advertises “guaranteed bathroom remodels \nin two weeks” and the job takes two months, your expectations are violated and \neither the marketing campaign needs to reflect that truth, or the operation needs \nto be retooled to fit the expectation. Either way, operations or marketing needs \nchange. Complaints of expectation violate customer expectations negatively. \nc omplaints of Void\nComplaints of void are when your customer continually requests something and \nyou simply don’t have it. Complaints of void are extremely valuable, as they expose \nunmet needs.\nEarly in my lead generation days, one of the most common complaints I received \nfrom limousine service providers was, “I don’t do weddings!” Customers would \nrequest limousines for weddings and some providers didn’t offer wedding service. \nLikewise, many providers didn’t do airport transfers. The complaints piled in and \na pattern emerged. I added a Web site feature that allowed providers to specify \nthe type of services they offered—problem solved. By fixing the issue, I  raised \nthe value of my leads. Higher value equals greater magnitude, higher profits, and \ngrowing asset values. \nComplaints of void are goldmines of opportunity. People freely tell you exactly \nwhat they want and you don’t have to pay for it! Unmet needs are served up on a \nsilver platter.\nc omplaints of Fraud\nIn March 2005, a woman entered a Wendy’s restaurant and claimed that a dis -\nmembered human finger was in her bowl of chili. Her intent was not only to \ncomplain but also to sue. Fortunately, the fraudulent complaint was thwarted after"

Ask any business owner \nand they’ll confirm fraudulent complaints are the most disheartening because \nthey reflect the worst of society: Illegitimate complaints designed to exploit the \nbusiness owner. \nI had to deal with fraudulent complaints almost weekly. A customer typos a \nprice and some idiot thinks that they are entitled to a limo for $5.00 an hour ver -\nsus the $50.00 per hour. “You owe me or I will contact my attorney and sue!” Yes, \nI’m sure you have an attorney. Good luck with that, champ. You’re going to pay a \nlawyer $250 an hour to fight over a typographical error amounting to 45 bucks? \nDo you know what kind of idiot you sound like?\nUnfortunately, when you deal with millions of customers, you will encounter \nhundreds of Sidewalkers determined to get theirs. Yes, it can make you cynical \nbecause complainers intending to exploit are low-class frauds. When you drop a \nfly in your soup hoping to get a free meal, sorry, you’re a crook. \nHow do you deal with exploitive complainers? You respond once with grace, \nexplain your position, and move on. \nPick y our b aTTL es\nBill Cosby once said, “I don’t know the key to success, but the key to failure is \ntrying to please everybody.” I started my business with an overzealous passion \nto keep everyone happy. That soon proved to be insanity. Complaints need to be \nmanaged with a balance, which is why I kept records. I wanted to identify patterns \nthat would enhance the value of my service. I knew better products produce better \ncustomers, and better customers pay well.\nNowadays it’s easy to follow the complaints for your business. Twitter.com \noffers owners the ability to keep track of what customers say. Google alerts can \nnotify you when a Web site mentions your company name. Keeping track of the \nfeedback is getting easier, but deciphering the noise is getting more difficult.\n“I don’t want to pay for your service.” Some complaints need to be ignored. If \nyou try to make everyone happy, you’ll drive yourself nuts. Pick your battles. Solve \ncomplaints that add the most value while helping the most. As a business owner you \nmust remember that, while you don’t have a boss, the person who pays your mort-\ngage is your customer and they always should be heard—but sometimes ignored.\nuse “ sucks” To y our a dVan Tage\nNo need to sugarcoat it. Customer service in the modern age sucks. We have \nbecome so swamped by poor customer experiences from the businesses in our life \nthat we now accept crappy customer service as a standard of expectation. Have \nyou ever called a computer manufacturer for support? Or called your big national\n\f\n278\nthe millionaire fastlane bank? Or called your health insurance provider? Sucks. Sucks. And double-sucks. \nCustomer service today has become a lost art. Our expectation of service with \nbusinesses has become so pathetic that we’ve become numbed to expect nothing \nbut disinterest.\nDown the block from my home, there is a strip mall with a corner restaurant \nthat changes ownership every six months. Since I’ve lived in the neighborhood, \nfour restaurants have opened and four have closed. While I can’t comment on the \nfirst three failures, and I can on the last. When I dined at the latest incarnation of \nthe restaurant, the food was decent but the service was deplorable. Drinks went \nunfilled. The silverware was dingy. The waitress was arrogant, as if our patronage \nwas an inconvenience. After leaving, I thought, “That place ain’t gonna last,” and \nsure enough, a few months later the sign went up: “For Lease.”\nWhile bad customer service is frustrating while playing our consumer role, it \ngives us entrepreneurs a great opportunity. Where customer service lacks unearths \ngreat opportunity . You see, the beauty of expectation is that it works in reverse. \nWhile complaints of expectation are about the violation of expectations negatively, \ncustomer service that S-U-C-S is about violating expectations positively. \neXchange “ sucks” F or “ s -u -c -s”\nYou can explode your business into the stratosphere by deploying a customer ser-\nvice strategy that exceeds expectations: I call it SUCS , or “Superior Unexpected \nCustomer Service.”\nWe all expect a certain level of suckage when it comes to customer service. This \nis an advantage for Fastlaners. For example, if I discover a $10,000 fraudulent with -\ndrawal on my bank statement, my first instinct is to freak out. My second instinct \nis to call the bank to resolve the problem. At that point, my brain immediately \ncreates a smorgasbord of expectations for the bank call. Here is my “expectation \nprofile,” or what I expect:\n • I expect to hear a recorded message or an automated attendant.\n • I expect to press a never-ending menu of buttons: press 1 for this, press 2 for \nthat, press 3 for something else.\n • I expect to be shuttled from one person to the next.\n • I expect to speak with someone not fluent in English named “Steve” but sound-\ning more like a Pradeep or Sanjay.\nThese are my expectations. No doubt, my customer service expectation isn’t \nthat favorable. My bank, and hundreds of other banks like it, gets away with \ncrappy service because it is now our expectation. However, let’s flip the scenario \non its rear. What if I call the bank and instead of the voicemail rat-maze, my call \nis immediately answered by an English-speaking person. No voice mail, no press 1,\n\f\n279\npART 8 — youR speed: AcceleRATe weAlThpress 2, no automated attendant. I get a REAL PERSON answering the phone, like \nyou answer your phone. After five minutes of speaking to the customer service \nrep, my problem is addressed and resolved—and heck, I wasn’t even transferred \nto another agent. I’d be like, “Holy Mother of God! Wow!”\nThis is a SUCS event: a Superior Unexpected Customer Service event. It is a trans-\nformation from customer service that naturally sucks, to SUCS. You see, when you \nviolate your client’s customer service expectation profile positively, you turn your \ncustomers into loyal, repeat buyers, and ultimately, disciples of your business.\nLeVerage Free h uman r esource s ys Tems\nOne passive income system is human resource systems—good old-fashioned people. \nExcept that employees aren’t cheap, so human resource systems typically need \nmanagement. Wouldn’t it be great if you could deploy a human resource system \nfor free? You can when you create disciples for your business.\nCustomer service that SUCS, service that violates your customer’s low-expec -\ntation profile positively, turns customers into lifelong clients, and disciples of \nyour business. They provide a never-ending stream of free advertising. Word of \nmouth is a powerful advertising tool because it’s FREE and reaps infinite return \non investment (ROI).\nYour customer service strategy will influence your company’s growth. \nSatisfaction implies expectations being met. To create raving customers, you \nmust exceed satisfaction .\nWhen I negotiated with potential buyers for my company, I was asked fre -\nquently: “How much do you spend to recruit advertisers?” My unexpected answer? \nZero. Incredulity and skepticism followed. Sure, I did it the old-fashioned way \nwhen I started: prospecting, marketing, advertising, and cold calling. But after \nawhile, my advertiser acquisition cost disappeared because my advertisers did it \nfor me . . . for FREE! When your clients love your business, they become disciples \nand advertise for you. They become unpaid human resource systems, evangelists \nwho drop your name wherever necessary.\nHow do you create disciples for your business? Provide customer service that \nSUCS—Superior Unexpected Customer Service. When you send an email to a \ncorporation, how long does it take to get a real, human response? A day? Week? \nAt my company, I answered my customer emails within minutes, not hours, days, \nor weeks. People would email us just to test our response rate. I was in business \nto violate my customer’s expectation profile, and it payed dividends.\nI followed this up with live customer service. A call to my company got a real \nperson that worked for the real company. No press 1, press 2. Support wasn’t out -\nsourced because I didn’t want service outsourced. \nCustomer discipleship grows businesses exponentially because human resource \nsystems talk. For example, my Web-hosting provider is Liquid Web. The first time\n\f\n280\nthe millionaire fastlane I contacted Liquid Web for technical support, I submitted a ticket and my expecta-\ntion profile formed … I speculated it’d be a day or two before I heard back. I was \nwrong. Within ten minutes, Liquid Web Support responded and fixed my issue \nwithin 20 minutes. They provided customer service that S-U-C-S and violated \nexpectations. \nThe result? I’m a disciple of Liquid Web. When someone asks me, “What \nhosting do you recommend?” I confidently respond with “Liquid Web.” I am an \nevangelic customer. I pay Liquid Web in two forms of currency: 1) My money and \n2) My frequent recommendation of their service. The effective value of this latter \ncurrency is priceless because I am now their FREE human resource system selling \ntheir product. Imagine the potency when you have not just one raving customer, \nbut 10,000. Will your business grow 2% in one year? Or 200%?\nTo provide great customer service and explode your business, determine your \ncustomers’ expectation profile. What are their expectations when they deal with \nyour business? How do they relate to competitors and similar businesses in your \nindustry? Make a subjective call on how your customers expect service. Then \nVIOLATE IT.\nAny time you violate your customer’s expectations to the positive, you get a \ndual benefit. First, they buy from you again. Second, raving customers become \nliaisons and disciples for your business and unpaid human resource systems. Both \nbuild speed.

Success in business comes from making your customer the boss and \nthe No. 1 stakeholder to your business. \nA stakeholder is defined as “Person, group, or organization that has direct or \nindirect stake in an organization because it can affect or be affected by the orga -\nnization’s actions, objectives, and policies.” Long-term business suicide occurs \nwhen you are your own selfish stakeholder and forsake your customer.

Public companies are the worst \noffenders, as shareholders come first, Wall Street second, and executives third. \nGuess who sits at the bottom? You and I. \nMy repeated, and often preached, motto to my employees was, “The customer \npays your paycheck, not me—keep them happy.” You see, my stakeholder wasn’t \nmy selfish desires for fast cars and big houses. It was my customer, because I knew \nthey had the power. My loyalty was with my customer. Yes, I had a boss, and the \nboss had the keys to everything I selfishly wanted. \nLook b ig, a c T s ma LL\nDuring Mr. Miller’s gym class in my sophomore year of high school, I became \naware of Mark Cegraves—except there was no such student. Mr. Miller had a knack \nfor butchering the simplest of names: Henderson became Hankerson, Seagroves \nbecame Cegraves, and Rickson became Rakesh. No matter what your name was, \nMr. Miller would shred it. I don’t know if he was illiterate or just old. \nSo fast-forward more than a decade, and who is listed on my Web site as my \nchief technology officer? Mark Cegraves. Oh, and look who’s my web developer—\nGretchen Hankerson! Wow, so did I hire my friends from high school? No, I didn’t, \nespecially since their names were just mere illusions of the real people. None of \nthese people worked for me. Yet if you visited my Web site’s “Contact” or “About \nUs” page, they were listed as employees in high profile positions: CTO , business \ndevelopment, or Web producer. These people weren’t employees, but it looked like \nmy staff was big, and growing.\nI admit that this started off as a harmless “inside joke” with my employees, \nbut I eventually realized it had a benefit: it was branding my product to look big. \nDominating. Well-funded. Growing. Of course, I’m not sure if butchered names \nfrom a 1987 gym class serving as employee apparitions was ethical, but my pur -\npose and intention was clear: I wanted to look big and act small.\nseTTing uP sucs\nBig companies notoriously give poor service as a model of expectation. Meanwhile, \nsmall companies are known to give better service with a personal touch. My \nobjective was to look like I had the power of a big company, yet give personal \nservice as if I were a one-person operation. When you receive personal, exemplary \nservice from a big company, you create a SUCS event and create loyal, evangelic \ncustomers.\nAnywhere customer service is expected to suck, you have a business opportu -\nnity. Looking big and acting small is a setup for SUCS events. The customer expects \nmediocre service from the start. This tactic works well for any company that oper-\nates without a physical presence. Obviously, you can’t look big if you own a small \nretail store, but for those of us with Internet companies, you can.\n\f\n282\nthe millionaire fastlane The trap that snares many business owners is the extreme opposite: They look \nsmall and act big. \n“Joe Blow Enterprises.” Does this give you confidence that you are dealing with \na strong, reputable company? This company name screams “This is a one-man \nshow!” and says nothing substantial or attractive. Sorry, “Joe Blow Enterprises” \nis a monumental fail. I’m sure the logo is nonexistent, and, if there were one, it’d \nbe bland, boring, or look like it was designed using some freeware paint program. \nThis company’s Web site is static, stale, and childlike. No, Comic Sans doesn’t cut \nit for a professional image. This company sells to the world but doesn’t have a toll-\nfree number. Small. Small. Small.\nThe problem compounds when their smallish business operates with biggish \ncompany actions. Call their business and you get a long maze of buttons to press \nonly to land at the bottom of a voice mail dump. Send an email? Forget it. Most \nemails are ignored, and the ones read are answered weeks later. “I’ll get back to \nyou” never happens. Customer service issues aren’t resolved in hours, but in weeks. \nIf you insist on working 4 hours a week, your business won’t grow because your \nselfishness is more important than growing a business meteorically. Look small \nand act big and you dig your own potholes.\nbeaT c om PeTiTors b eFore They sT ar T\nMy other purpose for “looking big” was to beat my competition before they even \nstarted.

It either works fabulously or it ends in \nfiery divorce.\nThree years ago, Jim and Mike were drinking beer at a bar and a legendary \nidea was born that compelled them to start a business together. Their only \nconsideration for the union was their excitement. They agreed to do a 50/50 \nprofit split and zealously began. Mike finds their first client, while Jim finds \nthe second. Within a few months, their client base expands to 28, enough for \nboth of them to draw a profit and quit their daytime jobs.\nAfter two years, Jim’s time on the job and quality of work starts to suf -\nfer. Not that Mike knows what Jim is doing every minute of the day, but he \nnotices something that concerns him. For every four clients Mike brings to \nthe company, Jim brings one, and sometimes, none.

This confrontation only decreases Jim’s productivity to where \nhe sometimes doesn’t have new clients for months. Mike tries to dissolve the \npartnership, and Jim resists. Why shouldn’t he? He’s collecting 50% profits \noff of Mike’s efforts. Mike ultimately has to hire a lawyer and seek a legal \nremedy. A few years later, the partnership is dissolved and, along with it, \nMike and Jim’s friendship.\nPartnerships are marriages. After the love affair and the lust wears off, they \nmust survive on character, synergy, and complementary attributes. My early \nentrepreneurial ventures were all partnerships, and all miserable failures. Not \nthat my partners were bad people, but our work ethics, values, and visions were \nnot compatible. I remember one partner had a normal 9-5 job and was active in \nintramural sports; the business was number four or five on his priority list. The \nother partner was out working four other businesses, including ours. That left my \nbusiness and me, which was priority numero uno . Do you see an issue here?\nSearch the Fastlane Forum for “partnership” and you’ll find a garden of com-\nplaints about partnerships gone bad. One partner wants to expand, the other \nwants to brand. One partner wants to advertise, the other wants to develop. One \npartner wants the expensive cars and the money yet arrives at the office late and \nleaves early. Partnerships are like marriage—half the time they will fail because \nthe partners just aren’t compatible.\n“They” say you should partner with people who have complementary skills \nto you. If I’m a marketing guy, I should partner with a technical guy. If you’re a \nsales-and-people guy, you should partner with an analytical guy. While this is a \ngreat starting point to find a partner, it’s like marrying the first person you date \nsimply because they have big boobs or look like Brad Pitt. Many other personality \ncharacteristics will make or break a partnership.\n • Do you have the same work ethic? Will your partner skate while you burn the \nmidnight oil? \n • Do you have the same vision? Or will they compete with each other? \n • Do you want to grow slowly while your partner wants to own the world and \ndo it fast? \n • Do you want to sell franchises while your partner just wants one unit that \npays the bills?\n • Do you trust this person with your life?\n • Do you have the same personality type?\n\f\n286\nthe millionaire fastlane The fact is people engage in partnerships for the wrong reasons. Like people start \nbusinesses under false premises (not need-oriented), they also form partnerships \nunder a similar false premise: Diversification. The partners don’t seek synergy; they \nseek diversification of risk, expense, and workload. Often, each partner looks to \nthe other for the burden to bear, and when one bears more, resentment builds. \nPartnerships can work, just like a lot of marriages work. Just make sure you \nknow whom you’re engaged to. A two-week honeymoon with your college room-\nmate might not be enough courtship to determine compatibility. Would you marry \nsomeone after two weeks of dating? \ng eT a + a ’s\nI’ve had many verbal negotiations with investors, and when the 90-page legalese \ndocument arrived on my desk, what was said and what was written were two dif -\nferent things.

Most likely for the wrong reason.\nA perfect example is the limo industry, where new companies recirculate like \nturnstiles at the train station. What compels someone to open a limousine busi -\nness? Rarely because of need. Nope, people get into the business because they are \nfulfilling their own selfish need—because they just want to, just like I wanted to \nyears ago. In fact, the limo business appears to be some sort of graduation from \ntaxi driver. Did the market need a new limousine company? Was there intent to \ndeliver a superior product that stands above the competition? Nope. The intent \nwas selfish: I want to own a limo company so I’m going to start one. \nThis creates excess supply and weak demand—too many limos running around \nand not enough customers. When supply exceeds demand, prices must drop; sud-\ndenly, the product becomes commoditized. Your total disregard toward market \nneeds leads down the road to commoditization, where you must sell your soul to \nthe buyer who wants the cheapest price. Where does this insanity start? People \nstart businesses they have no business starting. People start businesses “doing \nwhat they love” or “doing what they know.”\nA gentleman who owns a carpet-cleaning business posted a similar story at \nthe Fastlane Forum. He wrote:\nThe problem is that although I provide incredible value for what I do, it is \nbased on something that people don’t want to buy. People will avoid cleaning \ntheir carpets for as long as is physically possible. So in reality, I’m providing \nsomething that is of little value. Thus, I can conclude that I need to change \nmy business premise. So what values do I change my business premise to \ntarget? What do people value today? I think I’m in a business that is based \non a bad business premise. \nI feel bad for this man. Why is he in the carpet-cleaning business? Because there \nwas a need? Or because he needed a job and wanted his own business? Regardless of \nthe reason, he operates in an industry where the service is commoditized. Business \nowners fight over every customer while they earn fewer and fewer dollars for each. \nIf he wants to grow, he has to cut his price. \nMy response was that you can’t change your business premise because you are \nalready in the business. The right business premise would have steered you clear of \nthe industry or got you in the industry to attack a unfilled need. When hundreds \nof people get into a business solely because they know how or want to, and it is \nnot based on need, you get put into the position you are in: price wars haggling\n\f\n292\nthe millionaire fastlane over a few dollars.

Do dissatisfied customers litter the Web with \ntheir displeasure?\nWhen I launched my limousine directory, my competition consisted of exist -\ning Web sites and the traditional Yellow Pages. The weakness of both was risk. To \nadvertise, you had to pay a big upfront fee regardless of benefit. If you spent $5,000 \nand acquired one new customer, you just spent $5,000 for one client. Scary risk \nproposition, huh? I thought this was too risky for business owners, so I sought \nto solve it.\nFor mature companies, competition often serves to exploit what you shouldn’t \nbe doing, versus what you should be doing. My closest competitor was known never \nto answer their email. This gave me an advantage. If you are going to take your eye \noff the road and examine your competitors, expose their weaknesses. Exploited \nweakness is where brands are built: Differentiation is a defense to commoditization. \nWhat are they doing wrong? What inefficiency is there? Within the gray area of \nunsatisfied customers lies differentiation. The only alternative to boorish me-too \ngoods and services is differentiation, and that is accomplished by innovation and \nanalyzing your competitor’s weaknesses.

If you have an OK product (a weak knight), poor customer service  \n(drunk bishops), and incompetent people (a castle full of idiots), you can survive \nwith a powerful queen. \nThe queen is the most powerful piece in chess and it is also in business. Marketing \ncan convince people to buy mediocre products. Marketing can hide or disguise \nservice flaws. Marketing can shadow incompetence, and marketing can keep \nconvicted felons disparate from their product. The power of marketing is that a \npowerful ad campaign can move products, regardless of the cockroaches hiding \nunderneath. Marketing is a game of perceptions, and whatever the perception is, \nthat’s the reality. \nbui Ld a b rand, n o T a b usiness\nBusinesses survive. Brands thrive.

When your business is in business just to make money and pay the bills for\n\f\n295\npART 8 — youR speed: AcceleRATe weAlThthe month, you’re playing checkers and being one-dimensional. People are loyal \nto brands and relationships, not corporations or businesses. \nI love Coke and I hate Pepsi. I’m loyal to Coke, and I don’t care if Pepsi suddenly \nbecomes one buck cheaper—I’ll always buy Coke. Coke has built a brand, and the \npower of that brand is a firm loyalty that is difficult to sever. Is Coke objectively \nbetter than Pepsi? I don’t know or care.\nWhen you think about the automobile Volvo, what do you think of? I think safety. \nHow about Porsche? I think speed. How about Ferrari? I think rich. Volkswagen? \nPractical. Toyota? Reliability. Yet, when someone mentions Chevrolet, nothing clear \ncomes to mind other than looming bankruptcy, union squabbles, and unpredict -\nable reliability. Some auto manufacturers have carved out strong brands, while \nthe others fortify a business.\nOur friend with the carpet-cleaning business also has a business and not a \nbrand. Brands don’t have identity crises, businesses do. If our friend wants to \nexcel in an industry saturated with me-toos, he’s going to have to brand himself \nand differentiate himself. He needs to be a Lamborghini in a traffic jam of Chevys. \nWhat will make his carpet cleaning business different from the rest? Why should \npeople hire him even though his prices might be 20% higher?\nThese tough questions have tough answers, especially since his entry into the \nindustry was based on a faulty premise. However, upon further investigation, most \nof his unscrupulous competitors use bait-and-switch advertising tactics gummed \ndown with fine print. Perhaps this industry weakness is exploitable? My challenge to \nhim was to leverage that nuisance. Perhaps he can brand himself as a “no-nonsense” \ncarpet cleaner—fixed prices, no surcharges, and no fine print. \nApple, the computer maker, is a great example of building a brand based on a \nneed, or a nuisance. People hate viruses, spyware, and the constant “Your updates \nare ready” messages that are associated with PC computers. Apple exploited PC’s \nweaknesses and solved their problems. It has built itself into one of the most suc -\ncessful brands in history. Apple isn’t the cheapest because they’ve engineered a \nbrand and they can demand a higher price. Say “Apple,” and many images come \nto mind: creative, trendy, easy, and hip. When I think of PC, I think of blue screens, \nillegal operations, and “you must reboot your computer 17 times before this update \ntakes effect.” One is a business. The other is a brand.\ng eT unique: The us P\nThe first step at building a brand is to have a Unique Selling Proposition or a USP. \nAs a business without one, you’re adrift in a sea of me-too businesses without a \nrudder, unmoored to the tradewinds of the marketplace. USP-less businesses offer \nnothing distinct, nothing unique, no benefit, no logical reason that someone should \nbuy from them other than hope or circumstance wrapped around a cheap price. \nYour USP is the anchor to your brand. What makes your company different from\n\f\n296\nthe millionaire fastlane the rest? What sets your business apart? What will compel a customer to use you \nover someone else? \nMy USP was powerful: No-risk advertising. If we send you nothing, you pay \nnothing. Advertisers joined by the truckload because they were tired of advertising \nwith the Yellow Pages, which offered this risk proposition: “Pay us $5,000 upfront, \nthen hope and pray.” I exposed a pain-point and fixed it. Our carpet cleaner had \nno USP. Nothing set him apart, as he might as well just been a lonely grain of rice \nin a 50-pound bag of feed.\nUSPs are the building blocks to brands and can compensate for higher prices or \neven an inferior product! FedEx was introduced to the world when it said, “When \nyour package absolutely positively has to be there overnight.” M&M’s said, “The \nmilk chocolate melts in your mouth, not in your hand.” Notice how these USP s \ntarget benefits. I don’t like Domino’s Pizza (despite once being employed by them), \nand yet that didn’t stop them from building a pizza empire based on the USP  of \n“delivered to your door in 30 minutes or less—or it’s free.” Domino’s identified \nthe need: Pizza delivery was a long ordeal. They solved it, branded it, and the rest \nis history. How did Domino’s infiltrate such a crowded marketspace and succeed? \nBranding and marketing—the QUEEN  in the chess game.\ndeVeLo Ping y our us P\nHow do you develop a solid USP for your company? There are five simple steps.\nstep 1: u ncover the benefit(s) \nGet into business for the right reason: to solve a problem or a need. That creates your \nfirst USP. If you are already in business, find the greatest benefit of your product, \none that sets it apart from the competition. Do this with your customer in mind. \nThink about their needs and what they want. \nstep 2: be unique \nThe objective of a USP is to be unique when compared to the alternatives. This \nimpregnates the consumer with a logical argument for choosing your company, \nbecause, without your company, they are forgoing the benefit. USP s should use \npowerful action verbs that create desire and urgency. “Lose weight” should be \nchanged to “Obliterate fat” or “Shred pounds.” “Grow your business” should be \ndropped in favor of “Explode revenues” or “Shatter sales records.” \nThe uniqueness of your USP creates a consumer divergence when it comes to \ntheir buying decision. If you pick a Mac over a PC, you are choosing safety, speed, \nand reliability over viruses and bloatware.\n\f\n297\npART 8 — youR speed: AcceleRATe weAlThstep 3: be specific and g ive evidence \nNoise is everywhere, and if you are going to rise above it, you have to alleviate natu-\nral consumer skepticism. Do so by being specific, and if possible, offer evidence. \nWEB SITE: “Your car sold in 20 days or less or it’s free.” \nPRODUCT: “Drop 20 pounds or you don’t pay a dime.” \nSERVICE: “Your home sold in 30 days or I own it.” \nDomino’s Pizza didn’t say “Delivered on time,” they said, “Delivered within \n30 minutes or it’s free.” It was a specific action and evidence of that action. (Your \npizza is free if we don’t perform!) In my case, the onus was on me to send my \nadvertisers leads. If I didn’t, I didn’t get paid. “We send you business or you don’t \npay a dime.”\nstep 4: keep it s hort, c lear, and c oncise\nThe best USPs are short, clear, and powerful. Long phrases get skipped over.\nstep 5: integrate y our us P into a LL marketing materials \nA USP is worthless if it isn’t conveyed throughout every aspect of your business. \nInclude your USP on all your public communications:\n • Your trucks, vehicles, and buildings \n • Your advertising and promotional materials \n • Business cards, letterheads, signs, brochures, and flyers \n • Your Web site and your email signature\n • Your voice mail system, receptionist/sales scripts, etc.\nstep 6: make it r eal\nA USP has to be strong enough to convince people to buy or, even better, switch \nbrands. If it doesn’t capture your audience’s attention, or the benefit/hook is too \nweak, it won’t work. And then, you have to make your USP real. You must deliver \non what you say. A pizza delivered in 40 minutes makes the 30-minute guarantee \na fraud. Fraudulent USPs get exposed fast and create “human resource systems” \nready to rick-roll your company.\ng eT n oisy\nNext time you’re stuck in traffic, look around. Every car looks the same. Nothing \ncommands any significant attention. It’s a sea of fading exhaustive blather. Born a \nmarketer, this is why I’m preferential to Lamborghinis. They rise above the noise, \nand so should your brand."

The average teenager strives not \nto be like everyone else, which is why we’ve been deluged with nipple rings, eye \npiercings, Goth, and tattoos—all expressions of “I’m unlike everyone else!” \nSuccessful companies take the same approach with their branding and \nmarketing. \nWriting this book, while challenging, wasn’t the real challenge. Getting it into \nthe hands of people will be the real challenge. Why? Because the topic of finance \nand moneymaking is crowded and saturated with me-toos. In other words, the \nnoise is deafening. While this book is the realization of my dream, to succeed as \na best-selling author I need to get my brand above the noise.\nOne look at my Facebook update feed and all I see is noise.\nCollege dropout earns $ 2 ,000  in one day. Find out how!\nSee how I make $ 15 ,000  a month with this fantastic opportunity!\nNew startup with a forced-matrix plan guarantees you a six-figure income!\nI just joined this awesome affiliate program and made $ 300  today!\nBe your own boss! \nI recently used an Internet calculator that tabulated my “wealth percentile,” \nwhich ranked my net worth in comparison to all of my peers in the United States. \nI was ranked in the top 1%. While I’m flattered, it exposes my challenge. My net \nworth is indicative of “unique” and “extraordinary” but in the world of percep -\ntion, it’s lost in the noise. On Facebook, you’d never guess that most everyone is \nnear broke. Nope, on Facebook everyone is a multimillionaire, a success coach, a \nguru, or a model. Everyone is in the top 1% of his or her game, including the real \ntop 1%. You see, we all are marketers and some of us are marketers of an illusion. \nWhat this does is creates an abundance of noise and makes it harder for the real \npurveyors to be heard. Your marketing efforts must rise above the noise.\nh ow To r ise abo Ve The n oise\nThere are five ways to get your message above the noise: 1) Polarize 2) Arouse emo -\ntions 3) Be risqué 4) Encourage interaction and 5) Be unconventional\nPolarize\nPolarization probably isn’t the best business strategy for a mass-market brand, \nbecause polarization involves extreme viewpoints or messages. You don’t want to \npiss off half your customer base! However, polarization works fabulously for Web \nsites in need of traffic or books in need of readers.\nPolarization works because it involves an extreme viewpoint, which forces people \nto either love or hate you. Sarah Palin is polarizing. You either love her or want to \ntoss her off the deck of a boat in the alligator-infested Everglades. Political pundits\n\f\n299\npART 8 — youR speed: AcceleRATe weAlThuse polarization to sell books, because readers want to rally for a cause, or furiously \nrefute it. Web sites that polarize attract visitors as people defend their cause while \nothers attack it. If you’re a rabid fan of the Chicago White Sox and start a Web site \nthat viciously attacks the ineptness of the Chicago Cubs, you can expect a polarized \naudience—people who agree and concur and people who oppose and defend.\nThis book itself can be classified as polarizing. Many people will castigate my \nviewpoints as extreme since it goes against conventional wisdom. OMG  he said \nthe cutting coupons won’t make me rich! He castigated my 401 K! Opposition to \n“normal” will always be considered polarizing.\nbe r isqué\nSex sells, and it is the most used get-above-the-noise technique. Sex is a power -\nful noise disruptor because sex never gets old. You can overuse it, but people will \nalways respond to it, because sex is always in style. In 2005, GoDaddy aired its first \nSuper Bowl ad by using sex as weapon to get above the noise. The now-infamous \nGoDaddy Girl ads followed in subsequent years. I never thought the ads were that \ngood, yet they got above the noise and got people’s attention. The result? Increased \nsales and GoDaddy’s market share surged to 32% after 2006.\nI see the risqué technique used on Facebook by social media marketers. One \nwoman does video lectures on marketing techniques in her bikini. When she does \none of these, her bikini video receives five times  the viewership and comments. \nWhy do the bikini video lectures do so much better than the normal ones? Simple: \nSex gets above the noise. Men see the woman’s busty chest in the video preview \nand think, “Oooh, I gotta check that out,” while women are curious—“ OMG, who \nis doing a video in a bikini top?” It’s almost a mix of polarization and sex.\narouse emotion\nMost consumer buying decisions are driven by emotions. You and I buy stuff  \nbecause we want to feel something. I don’t buy a Lamborghini to go from point A \nto point B; that’s practicality. I buy to feel something—pride, achievement, unique -\nness, adrenaline, and fame. \nAnother example of using emotions to move your audience comes from the \nnonprofit organization the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty for \nAnimals (ASPCA.org). This organization was founded over a century ago and I had \nnever heard of it until recently. How did they break above the noise? They launched \na powerful marketing campaign that unleashed emotions; their commercials \nfeatured abused animals confined in cages with a tender, heartfelt soundtrack \nplaying in the background. \nIf you can move your audience’s emotions and make them care, they will buy. \nExhilarate people, make them cry and make them laugh. Your message will rise \nfrom the ashes of noise and compel people to buy.\n\f\n300\nthe millionaire fastlane be interactive\nIt’s one thing to watch, it’s another to do it. They say if you want to boil your passions, \ntest drive the car of your dreams. Interactivity increases response for anything. If \nyou can taste it, feel it, or use it, you will be more likely to buy it.\nInteraction is like hearing your name. It’s your favorite. On Facebook, the \nmost popular applications are “surveys” and “questionnaires” because people love \nnarcissism. My favorite movie is The Usual Suspects! I love pizza! I own a poodle! \nPeople love to talk about themselves, and if you entwine that into your marketing \nplan, you will improve the response to your product or service.\nFor example, if I launch a survey “Are you speeding the Fastlane or stuck in \nthe Slowlane? Find out now.” I am engaging in an interactive campaign designed \nto get people involved and to talk about themselves. When your potential cus -\ntomers break down their personal barriers and expose pieces of themselves, they \nmove closer to you as if there were a relationship. A relationship sells more than \nan anonymous corporate entity. \n“Find out what happens next . . .” Some corporations are using traditional \nmedia and the Internet to foster interaction. I recently saw a commercial for an \nautomobile manufacturer that filmed a story with a high-speed chase, except the \nstory never concludes and we are left with “Find out what happens next . . . visit \n[Web site].” By teasing audiences with messages or stories that are incomplete, \npotential customers are forced to complete the story by visiting a Web site, and \nWeb sites foster interaction.\nThe revolution of social media, blogs, and “Web 2.0” is founded on interac -\ntion. You just don’t want to read an article; you want to comment on it! Your two \ncents must be heard!\nbe unconventional\nConvention breeds familiarity. If you’ve seen it three dozen times in the last month, \nor something like it, do you think it will work? For example, “Be your own boss” \nis such an overused phrase its power has been drained. Yet, I still see advertising \nheadlines and subtitles from so-called gurus using “Be your own boss,” as if the \nphrase wielded power. Its been pulverized into flaccidity, so why the heck are you \nusing it?\nWhat’s unconventional? Have you ever seen a Lamborghini sold for a dollar? \nI know I haven’t and if I did, I would remember. The campaign would arouse curi-\nosity because it’s unconventional. What crazy person would sell an expensive car \nfor a buck? Is it a scam? What’s the catch? I’ve got to see! \nAnother example of unconventional is to break convention by mocking it, or \ninterrupting it. Remember the Energizer bunny? It’s still going and going. These \ncommercials built a brand based on unconvention—the advertiser created a \nseries of standard, boring marketing messages and shattered them with sudden\n\f\n301\npART 8 — youR speed: AcceleRATe weAlThinterruptions of the Energizer bunny. The marketer anticipated your familiarity \nwith convention (ugh, another boring commercial) and shocked the audience by \ninterrupting that boredom with a pink rabbit. AdAge.com recognized these com -\nmercials as one of the top 100 campaigns of all time.\nAnother mocker of convention is the Geico Insurance Company, which took \ntypical situations and interjected the scenes with a surprise punch line: “I’ve got \ngreat news! I just saved a bunch of money on my car insurance.” Conventional \nscenarios were shattered with the narrative, “I’ve got great news,” which created \nunconvention. Another Geico spot mocked convention when it appeared you were \nwatching a promo for a new reality TV series called “Tiny House.” The promo fea-\ntured a newlywed couple who supposedly move into a midget-sized apartment for \none full year and endure cramped quarters and rising marital tensions. You see the \ncouple hitting their heads on low ceilings and struggling for a good night’s sleep \nin a tiny bed. But wait a second, this expected convention of reality is nothing but \na ruse that will shatter into unconvention when an announcer voices: “The drama \nwill be real, but it won’t save you any money on car insurance.” \nIf you get someone’s attention, half the battle is won. The other half is letting \nselfishness take over your audience and tailor your messages to self-interest. In \nother words, the good old “What’s in it for me?” How about saving 15% or more \non your car insurance?\nw ha T’s in iT F or m e?\nIt’s ironic: To succeed a Fastlane we must forsake selfishness yet satisfy the selfish-\nness of others. Did I say this would be a nice cozy stroll down the beach?\nThe first human behavior you can count on is selfishness. People want what they \nwant. People don’t care about you, your business, your product or your dreams; \nthey want to help themselves and their family. It’s human nature. Therefore, our \nmarketing messages must focus on benefits, not features. People need to be told \nexactly what’s in it for them. How will your product or service help them? What’s \nthe benefit? In marketing speak, it’s called the “What’s In It For Me?” (WIIFM) \nprinciple.\nMy customers were small-business owners and yet I served millions of con -\nsumers, too. This intermediary relationship allowed me to study the behavior \nof both consumers and producers in a powerful, accelerated fashion. I learned \nthings in weeks that would take educators months to ascertain. I noticed that \nsmall-business owners fall into their own selfish trap and love singing the praises \nof their company. They sell features, not realizing that people rent convenience \nand events, not limousines.\nAs consumers, we buy things to solve needs. We engage in transactions to \nfill voids. You don’t buy a drill; you buy a hole. You don’t buy a dress; you buy an \nimage. You don’t buy a Toyota; you buy reliability. You don’t buy a vacation; you\n\f\n302\nthe millionaire fastlane buy an experience. We must become problem solvers, and to identify our business \nas a savior to someone, we must translate features into benefits. Does the fact you \nare the largest limousine company in Colorado solve my problem? It doesn’t until \nyou translate that feature into a benefit.\nTrans LaTing Fea Tures in To b ene FiTs\nIf you want to sell anything, translate features to benefits. A four-step process \naccomplishes this.\n1)  Switch places.\n2) Identify features.\n3) Identify advantages.\n4) Translate advantages into benefits.\nFirst, trade places with your typical buyer. Be them. Who are they? What is \ntheir modus operandi? Are they affluent CEO types? Or price-sensitive Wal-Mart \nshoppers? Cash-strapped students? Or single moms? If you can’t identify your typi-\ncal buyer, your results will be flawed and your benefit will be no benefit. Once you \nidentify your buyer, ask: What do they want? What do they fear? What problem \ndo they need solved? Or do they just want to “feel” something? \nFor example, two brands of the same product could have two different buyers. A \nperson who buys a Corvette is going to have different psychological motives than \nsomeone who buys a Volvo. Both are cars, yet the sports car buyer isn’t buying \nbasic transportation. The Corvette buyer is most likely a risk-taker, self-employed, \nindependent, outspoken, and assertive. The Volvo buyer is probably more con -\ncerned with family and safety. He or she is probably conservative, analytical, and \nfamily-oriented. Two totally different buyer profiles means each marketing effort \nmust be specifically targeted to the desires of each group. \nAfter you switch places with your customer and grasp what they want, your next \nstep is to isolate the features of your product. For my Web service, here are just a \nfew features I had: 1) Upload pictures 2) Target leads by vehicle, date, and service \nand 3) Schedule vehicles. While these features were great, it was my responsibil -\nity to translate them to benefits. What makes them so great? What advantages do \nthey offer my client? \nAfter you isolate the features, translate those features into benefits, or a specific \nresult. Extrapolate forward the benefit of that certain feature. This is where you \ndrive home why someone should buy from you, versus the other guy.\nFor my Web service, the feature of “upload pictures” translated to: “Quit wasting \ntime with client meetings at garages. Upload photos of your fleet and show your \nclients your product!” The target leads feature translated to: “Target the clients you\n\f\n303\npART 8 — youR speed: AcceleRATe weAlThwant—right down to the day, service, and vehicle type.” Schedule vehicles trans -\nlated to: “Maximize your fleet’s road time and receive leads based on your vehicle \navailability!” Each feature transcribed to a specific benefit that would compel my \nbuyer to join. I didn’t let them fill in the blanks; I filled in the blanks for them. \nusing Price as a b randing wea Pon\nPrice is like a paint job for your product or service.\nMy first taste of “paint” and its implications came young. I wasn’t much older \nthan six or seven. Mom staged a two-day garage sale, and she permitted me to \nsell some toys and keep the money. One item I offered for sale was a “football \nclock,” a timekeeping monstrosity. I vividly remember its sale price—$2.55. A \nsteal, I reasoned. \nOn the first day of the sale, my football clock gathered many looks, but no sale. \nMy young mind plotted. How can I get $2.55 for my clock? I didn’t want to budge \non my price, surely because $2.55 was the cost of some gadget I wanted to buy at \nthe corner store. Then I had an idea.\nI grabbed the masking tape Mom used for labeling prices. I tore four small \npieces of tape and stuck them above the current price. Then on the first piece of \ntape, I boldly wrote $5.55 and crossed it out. The next piece of tape I wrote $4.50 \nand crossed it out. Then, $3.95, and the next $2.95. Each piece of tape successively \nhad a lower price, clearly crossed out so buyers could see the “price reduction,” \nleaving the same old price of $2.55. \nNow my clock was priced exactly the same, except it was presented differently. \nThe taped higher prices, visibly slashed, conveyed two things: 1) A higher value \nand 2) A smoking deal. And guess what. The second person to look at the clock \nbought it. I succeeded at reframing price in the mind of my buyer. Of course, at \nseven years old, I had no clue what “marketing” meant nor what I was doing. Yet \nthis was my first exposure to marketing and the implication price has to value.\nPrice c on Veys m ore T han Jus T c os T\nPrice is a brand-builder because price implies value. The more expensive your price, \nthe higher its perceived value. The cheaper your price, the cheaper its perceived \nvalue. Price isn’t simply a number that tells someone what something costs. It \nconveys value and worth.\nThere’s an old story I heard about how price equates to value. Cleaning his \nbasement, a man found an old dresser and decided to give it away. He moved \nthe dresser to the street corner and placed a sign atop it: FREE . Shockingly, the \ndresser stood there all day, and for several days thereafter. This confused the man \nbecause the dresser, albeit old, was in decent shape and just needed a quick wood \nstain for perfection. The man decided a new strategy was warranted. He went to\n\f\n304\nthe millionaire fastlane the street corner and replaced the “FREE” sign with “$50.” Not an hour later, the \ndresser was stolen.\nSame objective, different pricing strategy.\nUnless price is your brand (Wal-Mart, Southwest Airlines), don’t let price steal \nyour brand when it should be defining it. Price is more than just a competitive \nmetric that slides up and down to sell goods faster. It also indirectly conveys the \nvalue of your product or service. I had multiple competitors who undercut me by \n10%, sometimes even 20%. Yet I continued to prosper. I wasn’t the cheapest, so why \ndid I do well? My service had better value, and I kept my price correlated to that \nvalue. My leads were better targeted. I had better joint venture partners. I had great \nsupport. I was running a brand while my competitors were running businesses.\nMy artist friend, who painted the most exquisite, beautiful paintings, priced \nher work through her own limited price filter. She was a single mom, struggling \nto the pay the bills, living paycheck to paycheck. For her, $500 was an extraordi -\nnary amount, and because of that, she priced her works far below their true value. \nHer own corrupted vision of price distorted her earning power and degraded the \nperceived value of her work. I suggested a price increase. Take that $90 painting, \nmake it $300, and see what happens. Sure enough, she sold just as much art at the \nhigher price, because price implies value and defines brands. \nEven in the Slowlane, pricing can play a role, in the form of a salary you’re will-\ning to take. For example, this was posted at the Fastlane Forum (TheFastlaneForum.\ncom):\nA company placed two ads for only one Web programmer position in \nthe paper. One listed the salary as $120 K a year. The other ad listed it for \n$32 K a year. The first, higher paying ad received only about four responses. \nThe second ad for MUCH less pay got over 100 responses. Most people have \na lack of confidence in themselves and their ability and are willing to settle \nfor so much less. \nAre you settling for less in business? Is your warped frame of value corrupting \nyour unrealized potential? The right pricing strategy is crucial to brand building \nand marketing. The wrong price conveys the wrong meaning. For industries with \nheavy commoditization, price is crucial. A public relations consultant can charge \n30% higher than their competitors, but a gas station can’t. \nWhile I’m completely heterosexual, I have a fascination with designer purses \nbecause I admire their pricing strategy. How does a handbag sell for $4,000 when \nit probably costs them less than $100 to produce? Branding and marketing. Price \nis apart of the brand build.\nPrice is one of the many ways to get into the consumer’s head. To use price \nfor your brand, you have to convince the consumer of value beyond the cost of its"

As a marketer you have to drill into your buyer’s mind and get your \nbrand differentiated. Own the consumer’s mind and you own the consumer. \nc ha PTer s ummary: Fas TLane d is Tinc Tions\n • Marketing and branding (the queen) is the most powerful tool in your Fastlane \ntoolbox. \n • Businesses survive. Brands thrive. \n • Businesses have identity crises, brands don’t. Identity crises force business \nowners into price commoditization.\n • Unique Selling Propositions (USPs) are the keys to your brand and differentiate \nyour company from the rest.\n • People have a natural disposition to be unique and unlike everyone else.\n • To succeed in marketing, your messages have to break above the advertising \nclutter, or noise.\n • Polarization is a great above-the-noise tool if your product targets a polarized \naudience—usually politics, minority opinions, and even sports teams. \n • Sex sells and always draws eyeballs. \n • Consumers make buying decisions based on emotions before practicality.\n • If you can arouse emotions in your audience, you will be more likely to con -\nvince them to buy.\n • People have a natural disposition to talk about themselves. If you can incorpo-\nrate interaction into your campaigns, you will have better success.\n • To be unconventional means to first isolate and identify what is conventional, \nthen doing the opposite, or interrupting that convention. \n • Consumers are selfishly motivated. Always target your messages toward the \npredisposition of “What’s in it for me?”\n • Features are translated to benefits when you switch positions from producer to \nconsumer, identify the feature’s advantages, and extrapolate those advantages \ninto a specific result.\n • Price implicitly conveys value and worth. \n • Don’t allow your own perception of price direct your brand to mediocrity.\n\f\n306\n44\nChoose Monogamy  \nOver Polygamy\nNo horse gets anywhere until he is harnessed.  \nNo steam or gas ever drives anything until it is confined.  \nNo Niagara is ever turned into light and power until it is tunneled.  \nNo life ever grows great until it is focused, dedicated, disciplined.\n~ Harry Emerson Fosdick\nc hea Ting sP ouses a ren’ T good Par Tners\nAs we near the end of our conversation; I must address the Fastlane’s need for \nfaithfulness . . . monogamy. \nIn college, my friend Markus Tekel was quite the ambitious entrepreneur. And \nMarkus, if you’re reading this, I apologize for the call out. But what the hell were \nyou thinking? Markus would get involved in a different business every week. One \nweek it was some moronic MLM program, the next it was some turnkey ad scheme \nfound in the back of an entrepreneur magazine, and the next it was some classified \nad program. Different week, different opportunity. My friends eventually coined \nthis opportunity-hopping neurosis the “Tekel Syndrome.”\nThe Tekel Syndrome is a compulsion to scatter your focus across different \nprojects and opportunities. It’s also a symptom of money chasing versus need \nfilling. When you invest your time into five different businesses, you become a \npolygamist-opportunist. The idea is to toss as much shit on the wall as possible \nbecause something’s gotta stick. Something’s gotta make me some money!\nA scattered focus leads to scattered results. Instead of one business that thrives, \nthe polygamist-opportunist has 20 businesses that suck. Ten businesses earning\n\f\n307\npART 8 — youR speed: AcceleRATe weAlTh$10,000 cumulatively are not better than one business that does it singlehandedly. \nWhen you segregate your effort among assets, you build weak assets. Weak assets \ndon’t do heavy lifting, and they don’t build strong pyramids. Weak assets do not \ngenerate speed. Weak assets do not scale to multimillion-dollar valuations. Weak \nassets do not accelerate wealth; they build income to pay the month’s bills only to \nstart over again next month.\nI forayed into polygamy when I started another Web business that mimicked \nthe model of my current company. Once launched, the new Web business siphoned \ntime away from my core breadwinning company. In effect, I cheated on my spouse \nand it showed. Time once allocated to my thriving company now went to my \ninfant company. The results were not good, and I had four options: 1) Continue \ncheating on my existing business, 2) Hire someone to manage the existing busi -\nness, 3) Hire someone to manage the new business, 4) Discontinue the new busi -\nness. Ultimately, I discontinued the new company, because I reasoned that hiring \nadditional employees would inject management time into my life. \nmonogamy Leads To c razy Fun Po Lygamy!\nI don’t know any highly successful polygamist-opportunists unless they were \nmonogamous first.\nSeriously, think about it. The richest people in the world got rich by focusing \non one core purpose, not by diverting focus. Lebron James wouldn’t be any good \nat basketball if he spread his interests around. He focused on one thing and one \nthing only: basketball. He ate, slept, and shit hoops. Now, with his legendary status \nand millions in net worth, he can afford to be polygamous with his interests.\nTo hit the top of your game, business or otherwise, you have to eat, live, and shit \nyour thing. If you’re dabbling in 10 different things, your results will be dabbling \nand unimpressive. Focus on one thing and do it in the most excellent way.\nSome of the greatest tech entrepreneurs built impressive companies by 100% \ncommitted focus, not diverted attentions into other ventures. After successful \nentrepreneurs hit the mother lode of wealth, then, and only then, do they divert \ninto other ventures that deviate from their core business. In other words, their \nmonogamy led to polygamy. \nWhat’s usually the first thing an entrepreneur does after they sell their com -\npany for $50 million? They go out and invest in multiple companies, get involved \nin philanthropy, and spread out their passions. Why is polygamy now possible? \nMoney. Money buys systems, like human resource systems, and money systems \nthat buy time. \nFastlane success comes from monogamy; not split attentions among wives \nand mistresses. It’s marriage. Yes, good old-fashioned monogamy. Focus on one \nFastlane business and kick ass at it."

Weak assets do \nnot accelerate wealth.\n • The most successful entrepreneurs lived their business and were 100% com -\nmitted to it.\n • Successful business monogamy can lead to successful business polygamy.\n\f\n309\n45\nPut It Together:  \nSupercharge Your Wealth Plan!\nYour choices are made in a moment,  \nbut their consequences will transcend a lifetime.\n~ MJ DeMarco \ngi Ve w eaLTh a s u Percharger\nThe journey of a thousand miles begins with one step. I’ve spun a lot of information \nyour way and it’s time to put it together and take your first step. It’s time to unfold \nyour process with concerted action. You now have the necessary psychological \nand mathematical framework that will give you better probabilities for wealth. To \nstart your Fastlane financial road trip strap on the F-a-s -T-L- a-n -e s -u -P-e -r - \nc -h -a-r -g -e-r , which is an acronym for the Fastlane process. \n1. Formula (Fastlane supercharger)\nWealth is a Formula and a systematic process of beliefs, choices, actions, and habits \nthat form a lifestyle. Wealth is a process, not an event.\n2. Admit (fAstlane supercharger)\nAdmit that the preordained path to wealth, “Get Rich Slow,” is fundamentally \nflawed because of Uncontrollable Limited Leverage, weak mathematics predicated \non time (Wealth = Job + Markets). Admit that “Get Rich Quick” exists. Admit that \n“no plan” is not a good plan. Admit that luck is the residue of engagement.\n3. Stop and Swap (faStlane supercharger)\nStop following the wrong roadmaps. Stop doing what you’ve been doing. Stop\n\f\n310\nthe millionaire fastlane selling your soul for a weekend. Stop thinking that 401 Ks and mutual funds will \nmake you rich. Swap ineffective roadmaps for the Fastlane roadmap. Swap your \nallegiances from consumer to producer.\n4. Time (fasTlane supercharger)\nTime is the king asset of the Fastlane—specifically, free time. Invest in activities \nthat will grant free time. Avoid time thieves, such as parasitic debt that transfig -\nures free time into indentured time. Invest time into a business system that can \ntransform indentured time into free time. Make decisions with time as a key \ndecision factor. \n5. Leverage (fast Lane supercharger)\nLeverage controllable and unlimited mathematics to create wealth. There is no \nleverage within the Slowlane wealth equation, an equation predicated on time \n(hourly pay, annual salary, annualized return, years invested). If you can’t control \nthe mathematics that predetermine your wealth, nor accelerate them into large \nnumbers, you can’t control your financial plan. Leverage is harnessed by a system \nthat does the work for you.\n6. Assets and income (fastl Ane supercharger)\nWealth is accelerated by exploding income and Asset value via a business that can \nbe systemized and eventually sold in a liquidation event. Live below your means \nbut seek to expand your means by focusing on income while simultaneously con-\ntrolling expenses. Exponential growth of income and asset value, not slashing \nexpenses, creates millionaires. \n7. Number (fastla Ne supercharger)\nWhat’s your Number? How much money will you need to live a lifestyle of your \nchoosing? Determine your number, break it down by the penny, and make it real \ntoday. Start saving your loose change, open a brokerage account, and put a chart \non your office wall that continually monitors your number’s progress. Make your \ndream lifestyle real by posting photos of that lifestyle at your workspace. For \nexample, if you want a cabin on a mountain creek, find a picture of that vision \nand put it on computer so you have to see it every day. Make your visions of the \nfuture real and force them into your psyche so you’re constantly reminded. If your \ndream is a Ferrari, buy a die-cast Ferrari model and put it in your car or on your \ndesk. Make those dreams real and inescapable!\n8. Effection (fastlan E supercharger)\nGrace Effection and you shall be graced with wealth. The Law of Effection states, \n“The more people whose lives you affect in an environment you control, the more\n\f\n311\npART 8 — youR speed: AcceleRATe weAlThmoney you will make.” Impact millions and you will make millions. When you \nsolve needs on a massive scale, money flows into your life. Money reflects value. \n9. Steer (fastlane Supercharger)\nLife’s Steering is choice. At some point, you must commit to the Fastlane ideology, \nand that commitment forms your process. Wealth is not a choice of event, just like \nyou cannot choose to lose 100 pounds and suddenly wake up 100 pounds lighter. \nHow you steer determines whether the Fastlane is a lifestyle or a hobby. To enforce \ngood decisions at the extremes, deploy WCCA and WADM. Decision horsepower is \nstrongest in youth and bleeds with age. Examine your past choices. Why are you \nwhere you are? What has been treasonous to your life? Why are you drowning in \ndebt? If you don’t rectify the mistakes of your past choices you will be destined \nto repeat them. Behavior change begins with a reflection of your past choices and \nmodifying them for the future to reflect a Fastlane mindset. Become responsible, \nfollowed by accountable.\n10. Uncouple (fastlane s Upercharger)\nOfficially Uncouple from the Slowlane wealth equation by creating your business \nstructure in a favorable Fastlane entity: a C- or S-Corporation, or an LLC. Thereafter, \nyour entity is the body of your surrogate business system. It “pays itself first” and \nthe government last. It survives time separate from your time. It is your first step \nat creating an asset.\n11. Passion & Purpose (fastlane su Percharger)\nWith a business entity and a dollar figure that outlines your dream life, you will need \na Passion and a Purpose to fuel you into habitual action. Don’t confuse “passion” \nwith “do what you love.” Passion burns your soul and drives you to do whatever \nit takes. Passion revs you with excitement and enrages you with discontent. Some \npassions are selfish (I want a Lamborghini) and other passions are selfless (I want \nto help orphaned children). It doesn’t matter what it is, as long as the passion burns \nhot enough to burn a hole in your pants and gets you embroiled into process.\n12. Educate (fastlane sup Ercharger)\nEducation begins at graduation. Pledge to never stop learning. What you know \nnow is not enough to become the person you need to be tomorrow. Seek Fastlane \nknowledge that fosters the construction and operation of business systems in \nan environment that you control. Get to the library and get on the Internet. \nInformation is the oil on your financial journey. Ensure daily reading in short \nbursts by leveraging existing blocks of time often squandered: the train, the plane, \nwhile exercising, on lunch break, an hour in the morning before work, or while \nwaiting at the post office."

Train your mind to see needs and problems. Observe your \nthoughts and language, because they expose unmet needs, or needs met poorly. You \ndon’t have to find the next breakthrough; just find a problem, a pain-point, or a ser-\nvice gap, and solve it. Many of the best businesses in the world are based on products \nthat already existed; the owners solved the problem better. When you focus on needs, \nproblems, inconveniences, and issues, roads open. Yes, the road chooses you.\n14. Control (fastlane super Charger)\nControl your financial plan as this refers to the Commandment of Control. Engage \nin an organization that you fully control, from pricing to marketing to opera -\ntions. Fastlane entrepreneurs don’t cede control over critical business functions \nto hierarchical control structures, because they are the control structure. Swim \nas a shark, not a guppy.\n15. Have (fastlane superc Harger)\nHAVE what others NEED and money will flow into your life. This reflects the \nCommandment of Need. You can’t explode your income by chasing money. Stop \nchasing money, because it eludes those who try. Instead, focus on what attracts \nmoney, and that is a business that solves needs. Money comes from providing value. \nCast aside selfishness and seek to HAVE what your fellow man WANTS. When you \ndo, money flows into your life because money is attracted to those who have what \nothers want, desire, crave, or need.\n16. Automate (fastlane superch Arger)\nAutomate your business and honor the Commandment of Time. Get your time \ndetached from your business. The best passive-income money-tree seedlings are \nmoney systems, rental systems, computer systems, content systems, distribution \nsystems, and human resource systems. The key to automation in any business lies \nin these seedlings.\n17. Replicate (fastlane supercha Rger)\nReplicate your system and honor the Commandment of Scale. Get on a playing field \nwhere home runs can be hit. To make millions, you must impact millions. To impact \nmillions, you must be on a field capable of affecting millions! Can your product, \nservice, process be replicated on a global scale to tap the Law of Effection?\n18. Grow (fastlane superchar Ger)\nGrow your business by treating it multi-dimensionally, like a game of chess. Build \na brand, not a business. Treat customers like your boss and reposition complaints\n\f\n313\npART 8 — youR speed: AcceleRATe weAlThto opportunities. Listen to the world as they offer the best directional clues. Resist \ncommoditization. Differentiate yourself from the competition. Get above the noise. \nFocus on one business and one business only. \n19. Exit (fastlane supercharg Er)\nHave an Exit strategy. Full passivity accomplished by a money system is one \nFastlane destination. Money systems are best funded by liquidation events of \nmassive asset values. Know when it’s time to liquidate your assets, transforming \npaper money into real money. Know when it’s time to get off the horse and learn \nto ride a new one.\n20. Retire, Reward, or Repeat (fastlane supercharge R)\nAfter liquidating your asset(s), Retire or Repeat. Regardless of which, Reward \nyourself for milestones met everywhere along the journey. Sell your first product? \nCelebrate! Go to dinner, buy a cigar, drink a beer. Break $100,000 in net worth? \nTreat yourself to something nice. Book a joint-venture deal? Celebrate with an \nindulgence. Go over $1 million? Take a nice vacation. Break $10 million? Buy a \nLamborghini. \n“u hh, s ir . . . w e’re cL osing . . .”\nThe Fastlane road trip isn’t a destination but a personal journey, and that journey \nbecomes your life and your process. You will discover that that journey is worth \nliving as long as your dreams are alive and have probability. It doesn’t matter \nwhere you start, but how you proceed.

    "raw_text": "315\nAPPENDIX A : \nReader Reflections\nMJ, I’m a high school teacher . . . how do I go Fastlane? \nWell, first understand that it isn’t going to happen on your current road. While \nI don’t suggest quitting your job (yet), I can suggest that you open up another par-\nallel road that you can travel. Is there anything in your line of work that defines a \nproblem that you can address? What if you invented a product that every school \nin the country needed for their curriculum? What if you wrote a book that was \ntargeted to teachers? Could you start your own private school?\nIf you can’t identify a need parallel to your existing road, are there other prob-\nlems that you can identify, on a different road? Perhaps a student can enlighten \na need that needs to be solved. Do you hear their complaints? Their issues, tri -\nals, and toils? Needs are everywhere, and they don’t have to be viewed from your \ncurrent road.\nRoads are opened only when you knock on their doors. Additionally, as a teacher \nyou have unprecedented access to time that most others don’t. Do you know how \nmany people would love to have three months off in the summer? Leverage this \ntime into a new road that can dawn a Fastlane. \nMJ, my neighbor has owned a business for 19  years. He’s never home, he never has \ntime for anything, and he certainly isn’t rich. Owning a business doesn’t guarantee \nwealth!\nI agree. Your neighbor’s problem is he’s on a road that doesn’t route to wealth \nbecause it most likely fails the Commandment of Time. If your business cannot \ndivorce from your time through a money-tree seedling, your business may really \nbe a dead-end job.\nMJ, I currently have $ 12 ,000  in debt and am barely making ends meet. Where do \nI start?\nStart by understanding the source of that debt. Why does it exist? How did it get \nthere and accumulate $12,000? Your debt accumulation wasn’t an event, but a \nprocess that happened over many years. You don’t just wake up one morning and\n\f\n316\nthe millionaire fastlane have $12 K in debt! Your choices led to your debt—the many choices to buy on credit \nover paying cash. You chose to buy those hideous clothes in the closet. You chose \nthe fancy car. You chose to run with the Joneses. Or perhaps you live in a house \nthat’s just too expensive and you have paid for everyday staples like groceries using \nyour credit card. Escaping credit card debt requires a commitment to process over \nevent, except in the reverse. Repent from the Sidewalk and make new choices that \nare designed to keep your debt from growing, or better, to get it declining. Pay \ncash for everything. If you can’t pay cash, you can’t afford it.\nSecond, focus on your income. Face it. You need to make more money. If you \nowned a business that profited $15,000 every single month, would that debt sud -\ndenly seem like such a burden? No, it wouldn’t. You’d have it paid off in weeks, not \ndecades. Income is the answer , with a temporary mandate at expense reduction \nto curb debt growth. \nCommit to starting a need-based business that you can use to expand income \nand expose yourself to the Fastlane wealth equation. Yes, you might need to get your \nhands dirty doing something that most others would find repulsive. You will need \nto do what most others won’t. You either want it badly enough, or not at all.\nMJ, my wife and I are traveling two different roads. She is a lifelong Slowlaner \nconsumed with saving every dime and living a life of frugality, and I am a serial \nentrepreneur who wants a little more from life. My problem is my “serialness” hasn’t \nproduced any success other than turmoil in my relationship.\nHas your wife read this book? If so, and she doesn’t agree with Fastlane philosophy \nnor want to participate, you might have tough decisions to make in your future. \nYour spouse is your lifelong partner, and if your roads don’t run parallel, it could \nbe rough riding ahead. Like our choices and their horsepower, relationships also \nhave trajectory. Today’s road that diverges one degree from your partner’s road \nwill be divergent 90 degrees years from now.\nPersonally, I’m not interested in relationships that are “good enough” but \nrelationships that empower both individuals to be the best they can be. I can’t \nspeculate on the strength of your relationship; only you can do that. Can you and \nyour spouse compromise on some common tenets that can bridge your divide of \nphilosophy? Like the value of time? Like the importance of financial literacy? Like \nthe need to divorce your income from time? Like the ruinous effects of parasitic \ndebt? Perhaps these common grounds are strong enough to keep your roads bound \ntogether for a common goal.\nAnd finally, your “serialness” might be a problem. Are you a polygamist oppor-\ntunist balancing 10 different opportunities? Your business is a spouse. Quit cheat -\ning and give one business all of your attention. You will get out what you put in, \nand rationing your time among mistresses is a slow prescription to lackluster \nincomes and asset values.\n\f\n317\nappendix a — reader reflectionsMJ, what about real estate? You don’t mention it a lot . . . is it Fastlane?\nI consider real estate “Wealth 1.0,” and for it to be Fastlane requires effort and \nmanipulation of the Five Commandments. Namely, are you a real estate investor \nbecause of need or because it’s just something you know? A successful real estate \ninvestor flips a house because it needs rehab. A successful real estate investor \ndevelops an apartment complex because the neighborhood needs it. \nAdditionally, real estate possesses magnitude but lacks reach. That means for \nits success, you have to engage in multiple successes, or intended iteration. One \ntiny property isn’t going to make you rich, but 200 accumulated over the years \nmight. Accumulation doesn’t happen in a few short years, but many. I never met \na 22-year-old multimillionaire real estate investor simply because it is a slower \nFastlane with asset values that cannot be manipulated as easily as your own self-\ncreated business. Asset value is limited by magnitude, which is why the richest real \nestate investors are not only older, but they focus on high-dollar properties. You \ndon’t see Donald Trump building single-family homes, but high-rises. Magnitude. \nReal estate possesses an excellent time detachment component that survives time. \nOnly you can determine if real estate is a Fastlane road that you want to travel.\nMJ, are you saying I can’t get wealthy working four hours a week?\nSure you can, because you define freedom within your wealth trinity . If wealth to \nyou is traveling the world with $100 in your wallet and you have a knack for getting \nby on subterfuge, schemes, shitty once-a-day customer service, barter, and other \nnefarious practices, go for it. If you feel you can own your life and take care of your \nfamily’s needs on $1,000 a month, go for it. Were there times when I worked four \nhours a week? Absolutely, and many times less! The difference was, I invested tons \nof work to get there, and I wasn’t earning $1,000/month, but $100,000/month.  \nI never met a multimillionaire who found success investing four hours a week from \nstart to finish. It’s a one-way street: Four-hour workweeks are fruit from money \ntrees, but money trees cannot grow from four-hour workweeks! \nMJ, what about affiliate marketing? Is that “Fastlane”? I know a few guys who are \nmaking good money as affiliate marketers. \nAffiliate marketing (AM) violates the Commandments of Entry and Control, and \nif you can subvert those restrictions, it can be Fastlane. Unfortunately, by itself, \nAM is not Fastlane. Oh blasphemy! I’ve been castigated on some affiliate marketing \nforums for my stance regarding affiliate marketing. Funny how I get labeled the \npinhead and those guys spend their days trolling the Internet looking to peddle \nsome Fastlaner’s product (like mine!).\nSure, I don’t ignore that many affiliate marketers make decent money; likewise, \nI don’t ignore that many lottery winners do too. And yes, there are some career \nnetwork marketers who are millionaires. My viewpoint is not absolute but about\n\f\n318\nthe millionaire fastlane probabilities . Whenever you violate control, you relinquish control. When an \naffiliate marketer joins my company and hocks my wares, he gives me control and \nI leverage weak entry. Whenever you violate entry, you must be exceptional. \nFor every affiliate marketer earning $30,000 a month there are 300,000 earn -\ning less than $100. For every network marketer who earns $50,000 a month there \nare 500,000 making less than $100. For every lottery winner who wins $1 million, \nthere are one million losers. Probabilities! If you think you can defy probability and \nbe exceptional, go for it. And congratulations! I can think of several exceptional \naffiliate marketers worth millions. It’s not impossible if you have solid process!\nExperience in non-Fastlane disciplines doesn’t mean that the discipline is \nworthless or to be avoided. I am about mathematics and probabilities—that’s why \nmy bread isn’t in someone else’s basket. Affiliate marketing is a powerful mecha-\nnism to grow your business; that’s why I advocate creating affiliate programs that \nthe masses will want to join, not joining them. \nMJ, do you suggest I skip college? \nIt depends on its cost, your maturity, your goals, and its marginal benefits. If you \nwant to be a doctor, engineer, or a nurse, yes, you need school! If you want to invent \na product that needs significant engineering, you’re probably going to need col -\nlege! Be careful of education servitude and know that a college education is not a \nprerequisite to wealth because formal education can sometimes work against you. \nThe velocity of any education varies by its intended purpose and its cost. I went to \ncollege and I have no regrets. In other words, I’d go again. \nMJ, my upline sponsor said you’re a dream stealer and that your viewpoint on net-\nwork marketing is flawed.\nGreat, then keep taking advice from him. Let me know how that goes in five \nyears.\nI have a wife and two children to support and I can’t afford to quit my job. Where \ncan I find time to go Fastlane?\nTime isn’t the issue—desire and passion are. You are deep in the trap because you \nhave responsibilities. This is how the Slowlane wins and keeps you amenable to \nits plan. To break free, you need to commit and draw from an insatiable passion \npersonal to you and your family. That passion will find you the time, whether it’s \nearly mornings, late evenings, or on the weekends. Without burning passion, your \ndesire manifests itself as only interest, and not commitment. Committed Fastlaners \nbuild wealth, while interested Fastlaners build excuses.\nMJ, when you bought your first Lamborghini, did that make you happy? I’m think-\ning about buying a Porsche.\nCars and other expensive toys will not make you happy. I was already happy when"

    "raw_text": "319\nappendix a — reader reflectionsI bought my first Lambo, and it reflected my reward (fastlane SuperchargeR). \nHappiness evolved from the process of the achievement, while the purchase was the \nreward and the event. Achievement is a process and it’s the cake of your experience. \nYour process of repeated and impassioned achievement toward your specified goals \nwill make you happy, not a car! And when that happens, you might find yourself \nshocked into the reality that that dream car is no longer desired.\nI’m a single mom and a dental hygienist. How do I go Fastlane? \nRegardless of your profession, going “Fastlane” lies in the commandments NECST \n(Need, Entry, Control, Scale, and Time). Can you create a business that solves a \nneed on a massive scale? On your existing road (dental), is there a need in the \ndental industry that would help thousands? If you can’t expose a need or a solu -\ntion respective to your industry, you have to expand your mindset to the world \nand the other roads that serve them. Remember, you aren’t just a dental hygienist; \nyou’re a mother, a woman, and a daughter. There are hundreds of roads in those \nsubsets. What are you passionate about? Politics? Natural living? Gardening? Are \nthere unmet needs therein? If you can’t figure out a new road, let a problem that \nneeds a solution uncover your road. \nStarting a business is risky. Is there any way to minimize that risk?\nYes. Get in business for the right reason, and the right reason is to fill a void in the \nmarketplace or to do something better than anyone else. Business becomes risky \nwhen entrepreneurs start companies based on flawed, selfish motives. Remember, \nstrangers don’t care about your dreams. We are inherently selfish, seeking to sat-\nisfy our needs and wants. Risk is escalated when you get into business without \na defined need, brand, or purpose. Risk is escalated when you get into business \ndoing what you love versus  doing what needs to be done . Risk is escalated when \nyou bequeath control over major business functions to someone else. Yes, business \nis a risk because entrepreneurs lose perspective on the fundamental purpose of \nbusiness, and that is to solve problems and help your fellow man. Profit follows—\nit doesn’t lead. \nMJ, it’s clear that you are a control freak. Since the Fastlane is predicated on passive \nincome from interest, how do you deal with interest rates since you cannot control \nthem? If interest rates are zero, doesn’t that invalidate the Fastlane?\nYes, when it comes to my financial plan I’m a control freak, and you should be \ntoo. If you aren’t in control, then you might become dependent on someone else \nfor your comfort and security. Not for me. Second, I agree that I cannot control \ninterest rates. However, your number (chapter 37) should be large enough to \naccommodate variances in interest rates. Even in this low-interest-rate environ -\nment, I still can find safe, predictable 5% returns because I think globally, not \nlocally. If your nest-egg number is predicated on a 10% yearly return, you are\n\f\nfooling yourself and will become susceptible to interest rate pains. Set the bar \nlow enough to expect variance.\nMJ, can’t a good mentor be a form of a wealth chauffeur?\nMentors are excellent resources if they’re sought for guidance and not as personal \nescorts. I’ve had the opportunity to mentor some individuals, and a few weren’t \ngenuinely interested in hard work or sacrifice; they wanted someone to absorb risk \nand handhold through the process. Mentorship is not about outsourcing process, \nbut about providing guidance as you forge your own journey. Good mentors are \naccelerative tailwinds! \nMJ, aren’t you being hypocritical by scourging “material extravagance” and yet \ndescribing the Fastlane by material items like Lamborghinis and big houses? \nNo, because the Fastlane isn’t about buying stuff but about freedom , and the \nfreedom to afford whatever you want. There’s a difference between being impris-\noned by your stuff and buying stuff you can afford. If you can drop $300,000 for \na car and not be a shackled to the purchase, go for it.\nMJ, I’m in a rut and can’t seem to break free. I stock shelves during the day and wash \ndishes at night. I can’t seem to make headway.\nChange starts with your beliefs, because they dictate your future choices. If you \nwant to make headway, you have to believe you can make headway. You have to \nchoose to start your process and that starts with a simple choice. Start making \nbetter choices, and your first choice should be an analysis of your past choices. \nWhy are you where you are? What has been treasonous to your life that has put \nyou at a stainless steel sink washing dishes? \nSecond, you need to personally reflect on how you can help others within \nyour talents. If you lack talent, you need to acquire it. You can become an expert \nat anything with enough study and application. This is fact. Unfortunately, such \ndedication comes with a price and it often involves turning off the TV and making \na sacrifice of immediate pleasures in lieu of a more favorable future.\nI don’t care if you’re scrubbing toilets; if you solve the needs of many, you will \nsolve the needs of one. And that one person? That one person is you."
