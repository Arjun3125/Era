    "raw_text": "PREFACE\nCAN THIS BOOK REALLY\nMAKE ME RICH?\nThere are few ways that a man can be more\ninnocently employed than in getting money.\nSAMUEL JOHNSON (Boswell's LIFE OF JOHNSON)\nWHY WOULD A RICH PERSON WASTE TIME WRITING\nA BOOK TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE GET RICH?\nTwo reasons. Because I enjoy writing about something I feel I know about.\nAnd because I believe that almost anyone of reasonable intelligence can\nbecome rich, given sufficient motivation and application.\nIt also helps that I am writing while sipping a very fine wine indeed (a\nChateau d'Yquem 1986 if you really want to know), nibbling on fresh\nsmoked conch tidbits, ensconced by a window with one of the most  \nbeauti ful\nviews on earth. Across the valley, far, far below me, palm trees fringe the\nfishing boats and yachts nodding in the harbour. Beyond the bay to the west,\na turquoise sea ripples out to a purple and pink horizon, heralding another\nglorious sunset.\nIn the words of a Victorian English poet:\nHow pleasant it is to have money, heigh-ho!\nHow pleasant it is to have money.\n\f\nI am in Mustique, a tiny island in the Windward Islands of the Caribbean.\nMore specifically in my 'writer's cottage', a new study-cum-library some\ndistance from the main house, built solely for one purpose - to permit me to\nwrite whatever I damn please in peace and quiet. Which is usually poetry, by\nthe way.\nAnd all of this, as if you needed me to remind you, costs money. It's what\nyou get, if you want, when you're rich.\nSO YOU AREN'T DOING THIS FOR THE MONEY?\nMoney is always welcome. But no. Very, very few authors become rich.\nThe odds against it are too steep. Merchandising and 'brand extensions',\nlike movies, games and toys based on fictional books, occasionally do the\ntrick. But nobody is going to buy a toy called 'How to Get Rich' now, are\nthey? (Then again, there's always the board game and the reality TV show\n... just joking!)\nIS THIS SOME KIND OF CON-JOB?\nARE YOU USING A GHOSTWRITER?\nNope and nope. How to Get Rich is not a con-job. And it is not being ghost\nwritten. I am going to write every word myself in this book, Lord help me.\nIt will contain no jargon or mumbo-jumbo and it is certainly not one of\nthose messianic 'self-improvement' manuals seeking to spawn a cottage\nindustry of audio-visual tapes, DVDs and dubious hour-long commercials on\nlate-night television. Nor will you have to chant incantations or tie healing\ncrystals round your neck - let's leave that malarkey to footballers' and \npoliticians' wives, shall we?\nHow to Get Rich sets out to tell you how I did it, how I got rich without\nthe benefit of a college education or a penny of capital. It will expose the\nmany errors I made along the way - which will contribute greatly to the\nlength! Finally, it will suggest ways in which you can avoid such errors and\nstart on getting rich.\n\f\nCAN THIS BOOK REALLY MAKE ME RICH? YOU'LL BE\nSUGGESTING THAT IT WILL IMPROVE MY SEX LIFE NEXT\nPossibly, to the first. It depends on your degree of motivation. In the event\nof that possibility materialising, the answer to your second comment is: 'Yes,\nit most certainly will!'\nI cannot make you happy. I cannot make you healthy. But I'm pretty\ncertain I can improve your chances of becoming rich. Which, in turn, will\nimprove your sex life. People who grow rich almost always improve their sex\nlife. More people want to have sex with them. That's just the way human\nbeings work.\nMoney is power. Power is an aphrodisiac. It even says so in the Bible:\n'Wine maketh merry: but money answereth all things' (Ec. 9:10). Money did\nnot make me happy. But it quite definitely improved my sex life.\nJUST HOW QUICKLY CAN I BECOME RICH?\nQuicker than you probably deserve, but slower than you would like - there\nare too many variables for a definitive answer.\nI have known it done inside five years, but there are very few 'short cuts',\neither in life or in this book. As the American critic H. L. Mencken once\nwrote: 'The inferior man's reasons for hating knowledge are not hard to\ndiscern. He hates it because it is complex - because it puts an unbearable\nburden on his meagre capacity for taking in ideas. Thus his search is always\nfor short cuts. All superstitions are such short cuts. Their aim is to make the\nunintelligibie simple, and even obvious.'\nMencken was right. That's why I'm determined to cut any pseudo-scientific\ndrivel and jargon out of this book. It makes for good copy and adds a\nspurious touch of authority to any debate. But it also leads inevitably to\nerror, being comprised of error itself: the delusion that incomprehensible\nwaffle impresses its audience.\nKnowledge learned the hard way combined with the avoidance of error,\nwhenever and wherever possible, is the soundest basis for success in any\nendeavour\n\f\nWHAT WILL I NEED TO DO.\nAPART FROM READING THE BOOK?\nAll the usual stuff. Just as the brilliant reggae old-timer, Jimmy Cliff, used to\nsing in his most famous song: 'You can get it if you really want ...' He\nsucceeded, and so can you. But only if you really do want. And only if 'you\ntry ... try and try ... and try again ...' But we'll get to that later.\nThe bottom line is that if I did it, you can do it. I went from being a\npauper - a hippy dropout on the dole, living in a crummy room without the\nproverbial pot to piss in, without even the money to pay the rent, without a\nclue as to what to do next - to being rich. And I am certainly no business\ngenius, as my rivals will happily and swiftly confirm.\nYet the odd thing is, I've ended up far richer than most of my rivals,\nHOW DID YOU DO IT?\nRead the book and find out!\nDO I HAVE TO READ YOUR BOOK\nFROM BEGINNING TO END?\nNo. Dip in and out as you like. Make notes. Jot down points you think apply,\nparticularly to your situation and your personality. Or make no notes at all -\njust highlight sentences or examples that catch your fancy.\nA book like this is a tool, not an artifact. And you do not have to\nagree with every point I make - one size does not suit all in the quest for\nfilthy lucre.\nWHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HOW TO\nGET RICH AND ALL THE OTHER BOOKS ABOUT\nBECOMING INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL?\nSimple. I am not a charlatan and do not profess to be a miracle worker. How\nto Get Rich is being written for amusement, not just effect or to earn a\nfortune in the so-called 'self-improvement' industry. And, because I have\nlittle left to prove in the field of generating wealth, my book is as truthful\nand as complete as I can make it.\nLastly, I don't want to sell you anything else — like volume II and then\nvolume III or a set of patronising video tapes or DVDs. All you see is all you\nget with How to Get Rich.\n\f\nI did not become rich by writing manuals telling other people how to get\nrich. I do not have pearly-white teeth and I do not stride onto TV studio\npodiums in 'casual' suits costing $10,000 spouting mantras with a cover\nversion of 'Simply the Best' belting out from the loudspeakers in front of a\nstaged audience of adoring 'fans'.\nI got rich my way. You might even say the old-fashioned way. By making\nerrors, lots of errors, and learning from them.\nMuch of what I intend to share with you concerns those errors, rather\nthan my successes. In a nutshell, I'm not a mountebank. I'm just a guy that\ngot rich in the real world, not on the 'self-improvement' happy-clappy merry-\ngo-round, where the only real winner is the weasel with the blow-dried hair.\nHOW RICH ARE YOU, ANYWAY?\nI don't know. Neither does any rich person know. I haven't cashed in all my\nassets yet and I'm not certain what they will fetch. Let's say between $400\nmillion (US dollars) and $900 million of net worth before tax. I honestly\ncannot fix a number any closer than that.\nFive homes. Three estates. Fancy cars. Private jets. (The jets are always\nrented. If it flies, floats or fornicates, always rent it - it's cheaper in the long\nrun.) Thousands of acres of land. Art on the walls and libraries stuffed with\nfirst editions. Bronze statues littering up the garden. Chauffeurs, house-\nkeepers, financial advisors and other personal staff coming out of my rear\nend.\nOh, and thousands of bottles of fine wine in the cellars. Never forget\nthe wine.\nLess the debt, of course. Around $30 million of debt. Rich people always\nhave a certain degree of debt. Apparently it helps to reduce taxes - but I'm\nnot so hot on the bean-counting side. In fact, I still haven't quite got the\nhang of a balance sheet. Amortisation always floors me\nBut then, I can't fly the jets or drive the Rolls-Royces or Bentleys either.\nI never had the time or the inclination to learn. My constant refrain when I\nwas bumming rides from friends as a teenager was: 'You don't understand. I\nwas born to be driven.' Both my friends and myself thought that was just a\nsmart-aleck remark back then. Now, I kind of wonder if I already knew, or\nat least suspected.\nOne or two more questions - then let's move on."

    "raw_text": "HONESTLY SPEAKING, WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE\nGET TO BECOME RICH?\nAn interesting topic. The writer, F. Scott Fitzgerald, once said: 'Let me tell\nyou about the very rich. They are different from you and me.' By which, I\nsuppose, he meant that they appear to have acquired characteristics that set\nthem apart from 'lesser' mortals. Ernest Hemingway's response was: 'Yes,\nthey're different, they have more money.' Typical Hemingway. But his\nriposte isn't entirely satisfactory.\nThere is a confidence that radiates from first-born sons and daughters.\nNot in all the cases I've observed, but in too many for it to be a coincidence.\nA similar confidence is to be observed, more often than not, in people who\nare rich, no matter whether they were born with it, inherited it or acquired\nit through their own efforts.\nYou can see it in the way they walk into a hotel or restaurant they have\nnever visited before. In the irritating disposition of rich women to haggle in\nan Oxfam shop over a designer dress - unlike any working-class woman, who\nwould be horrified at the thought of doing any such thing, even though she\nperhaps needs the discount while the rich woman does not.\nYou can see it, too, in the way the children of the rich appear to assume\nthat the world was created entirely for their sole benefit. Money brings a  \nkind\nof insouciance with it. It is among wealth's least attractive characteristics.\nHere is Richard Rumbold, an English republican 'conspirator', speaking\nfrom the scaffold in 1685:\nI never could believe that Providence had sent a few men into the world,\nready booted and spurred to ride, and millions ready saddled and\nbridles to be ridden.\nAnd neither, gentle reader, could I. I never could believe that.\nWhatever qualities the rich may have, they can be acquired by anyone\nwith the tenacity to become rich. The key, I think, is confidence.\nConfidence and an unshakeable belief it can be done and that you are the\none to do it.\nTunnel vision helps. Being a bit of a shit helps. A thick skin helps.\nStamina is crucial, as is a capacity to work so hard that your best friends  \nmock\nyou, your lovers despair and the rest of your acquaintances watch furtively\nfrom the sidelines, half in awe and half in contempt. Luck helps - but only if\n\f\nyou don't seek it.\nThe answer to the question, then, is perhaps this: not those who want to\nand not those who need to, but those who are utterly determined to - what-\never the cost.\nWHAT ARE THE BIGGEST MYTHS YOU KNOW\nREGARDING GETTING RICH?\nThe first is the claim that people did not set out to get rich but became rich\nby 'accident'. 'Oh, I only did what I love to do and woke up one day to find\nmyself wealthy.' That sort of thing. It may have happened. But very rarely in\nmy experience.\nSome people are merely better at disguising desire, that's all. Others,\nusually not those you would care to spend a vacation with, have a naked lust\nfor money stamped on their features, evident in even their most common-\nplace conversations. But a capacity for disguise and dissimulation doesn't\nalter the fact that the vast majority of the self-made rich worked, secretly or\nopenly, like billy-o to acquire their wealth.\nThe second myth is that people got rich by having a 'great idea'. While\nthis is a more feasible hypothesis than having got rich by accident, it is a trap,\nbecause it is a partial truth. All of us have had great ideas from time to rime.\nI have had a great idea for a kind of Spiderman gun that would shoot out a\nsticky web at a burglar in your house and disable them without harming\nthem. Will it get made? Probably not.\nThe follow-through, the execution, is a thousand times more important\nthan a 'great idea'. In fact, if the execution is perfect, it sometimes barely\nmatters what the idea is. If you want to get rich, don't sit around waiting for\ninspiration to strike. Just get busy getting rich.\nThirdly, and lastly, I think that perhaps the most destructive myth about\nbecoming rich lies in remarks like: 'Well, it was OK for you starting out in\nthe late 1960s. But times have moved on. You couldn't do it that way today.'\nPerhaps not, but you can certainly do it some way. Times change, but\nhuman nature, the lure of wealth and the determination to acquire it remain\na shining constant in the world of ambitious men and women. The example\nof others not even born in the 1960s is all around you. They prove such\nthinking to be false.\nIf you think that it can't be done and dwell on that thought too long,\nthen you are likely to remain poor. It's as simple as that."

    "raw_text": "WHY START A BOOK LIKE THIS WITH A POEM?\nDID YOU WRITE IT?\nYes I wrote it - but that particular poem is more in the way of a nursery\nrhyme. And I began this book with a poem to demonstrate that becoming\nrich has given me the most precious thing in life.\nAnd just what is the most precious thing in life that riches can supply?\nEasy For me, it's Time.\nTime. Time to read and write poetry if I want to. Or to write a book if it\ntakes my fancy. Time to travel on the slightest whim, to walk in the woods,  \nto\nthink, to commission art, to read, to drink, to hang out with friends and loved\nones ...  to do just about anything really, as long as it does not involve day  \nafter\ngrinding day making money in an office or a factory for somebody else.\nThat's what money can do. That's why you picked this book up. To\nmake the money to do what the hell you want. Now I suggest you flip the\npage and read the poem that follows - even if you do not normally read\npoetry it's worth a couple of minutes of study. Its subject is the destructive\npower of a certain type of envy.\nThen skip to the Introduction, where we can discuss just how rich you\nwant to be.\n\f\nWhat's It Like Then, Being Rich?\nWhat's it like then, being rich,\nKnitting gold to warm an itch?\nVery much like being poor;\nWealth is just a key, no more.\nWhy not share this magic key\nTo luxury - and start with me!\nSurely better that you earn it;\nCould I trust you to return it?\nHow does one become your ilk?\nIs it bred in mothers' milk?\nMany paths can lead to riches,\nFew in sunlight, most in ditches.\nWherein lies the difference\nFrom us - this odd ambivalence?\nEnvy, malice, obligations;\nToadying from poor relations.\nGrown far richer than his neighbour,\nWhy would any rich man labour?\nWealth is salt in wine immersed.\nQuaffing but excites the thirst.\nSalt my arse! It's filthy greed -\nHow many homes does one man need?\nFor some the trick's in trading it;\nFor others, in parading it.\nI've seen. But surely, comfort pales\nPerched on padded Chippendales?\nWhen affluence holds no surprise,\n\f\nWonders come in others' eyes.\nAye, the eyes of tart and whore!\nWhat might you miss, if you were poor?\nTime, The luxury of choices.\nFirst editions. Old Rolls-Royces,\n\f\nINTRODUCTION\nHOW RICH?\nWhat's a thousand dollars?\nMere chicken feed, A poultry matter.\nGROUCHO MARX, THE COCONUTS\nThis is a thin(ish) book with a hefty(ish) price. But a price probably worth\npaying for those who absolutely, positively - even desperately - wish to be \nrich.\nNot super-rich, mind you. Not filthy, stinking rich. This book cannot\nassist anyone who aspires to the Bill Gates or Duke of Westminster leagues.\nNo book can do that and that is not our concern here. Bill's vast fortune, I\nwould suggest, did not arise simply from the implementation of good ideas\nor the fulfilment of any single vision. It derives from deep within Bill Gates\n- and we'll come on to that later.\nThe duke, of course, inherited his massive fortune. Today, he is appar-\nently worth the best part of £5 billion. His job is to safeguard that fortune\nfor succeeding generations of dukes, especially from the predations of  \ngreedy\ntax collectors and spendthrift governments. I do not envy him such a task. It\nmust be weary work, labouring for descendants he will never meet.\nThe duke, then, is massively asset rich and relatively cash poor. Relatively,\nmind. (No pun intended.) We'll come on to that later in this chapter.\nRelative wealth is a fascinating subject.\nNo, this book is about becoming one of the common or garden rich -\nworld-class footballer rich; or J. K. Rowling rich; or rich enough to stop\nlooking at the price of almost anything that takes your fancy. Rich enough to\nretire, or to work eighteen hours a day, or drink yourself into oblivion every\nnight — if that's what you want.\nRich enough to smile sweetly or sneer at bank managers, depending on\nwhat you had for breakfast that morning; to turn your relatives green with\npoorly concealed jealousy while they creep around with their hands out; rich\nenough to buy a massive yacht (I don't advise it, though) and sail away into\nthe sunset like the Owl and the Pussycat for years on end."

    "raw_text": "Rich enough to live where you want, to go where you want, to do what\nyou want, to meet who you want. Rich enough to buy the only two things\napart from health and love worth fussing about in life. Time. And the option\nof not having to be in any particular place on any particular day doing any\nparticular thing in order to pay the rent or the mortgage.\nAnd rich enough to begin to worry about taxes. To begin the process of\nemploying that vast army of lawyers, accountants, advisors and estate plan-\nners who will descend upon you like uninvited vultures after a battle. A\ngroup to whom, even though you pay them tens and tens of thousands of\npounds a year, you will be forever in thrall. (That large yacht and the sailing -\naway plan is looking better by the minute, isn't it!)\nCertainly rich enough for people to respect you - but in a peculiar way.\nNot in the way we respect people who do really tough, worthwhile jobs -\nthose who nurse dying children or teach for a living. And certainly not the\nrespect earned by heroines and heroes like Marie Curie or Nelson Mandela.\nMoney in sufficient quantities garners a different kind of respect for its\nowner, a difference rooted in the nature of envy. Few of us have the courage\nto nurse dying children or to spend decades in prison fighting tyranny. And\nwe do not envy those who can do such things, even as we look up to them.\nOn the other hand, nearly all of us want money. We feel free to envy the\nrich. And most of us believe, rightly or wrongly, that we would be pertectly\nable to cope with the pressures associated with acquiring too much money.\nThe more thoughtful among us might conclude that we would be able do a\nlot of good with it, as well as making ourselves and our families secure.\nAsk yourself this : is there a single person of your acquaintance you could\nbe certain would refuse a bequest of £10 million? Personally, I cannot. And\nI'm willing to bet you can't either.\nSo how rich is rich?\nThe value of money changes inexorably over time, even in decades and\ncenturies of low inflation. Economists and historians now have so many\nmethods of evaluating the comparative worth of money over long periods\nthat the exercise has become virtually meaningless to all but specialists.\nMeaningless because of the changes in the quality and range of goods avail-\nable, the earning power of immediate and foreign neighbours, the impor-\ntance (or otherwise) of the preservation of ancestral assets like land and art,\nand a host of other factors.\nSo let's ignore all that and plump for 'purchasing power' in the last quar-\n\f\nter of a century as a rough-and-ready guide. Since 1980, the purchasing  \npower\nof $1 million in the US has decreased by more than half. In Britain, the\npurchasing power of £1 million in 1980 has decreased by over 60 per cent.\nTo put it another way, £760,000 in hard cash back in 1980 would equate\nto the spending power of £2 million today. While you might not have been\na millionaire technically back then, you would certainly have been the equiv-\nalent of one by today's standards.\nSo how rich is rich in the first decade of the 21st century?\nThe following table is based on tax-paid cash-in-band or assets that can\nbe swiftly reduced to cash - publicly traded stocks and shares, bank drafts,\ngold, etc. It takes no account of assets that take time to realise without incur-\nring loss in a \"fire sale' - your home, property, land, shares held in private\ncompanies, pension funds or fixed bonds. It also assumes you have low debt\nand live in a Western democracy.\nTable 1: Wealth Measured by Cash-in-hand or Quickly Realisable Assets\nThe comfortable poor\nThe comfortably off\nThe comfortably wealthy\nThe lesser rich\nThe comfortably rich\nThe rich\nThe seriously rich\nThe truly rich\nThe filthy rich and the super rich\nNote to Table 1: There are few people in the world who could put their hands  \non £100 million in cash in a week or even a month, no matter what they are  \nworth.

    "raw_text": "As far as the total asset value or true net worth of a person is concerned (as \nopposed to quickly realisable net worth), the numbers arc very different. And \ndifferent for a variety of reasons. Pardy because of capital gains tax and other \nlevies. Partly because death leads to death duties. Pardy because of planned \ninheritance schemes and donations to trusts and charities. And mostly, because \nfew rich people can know their true net worth until all dicir major assets are \nsold off.\nIt sounds crazy, but the richer you are and the more financial advisors you \nemploy, the less likelihood there is that you can ever discover what you are \nreally worth. It's a nice problem to have, but it is still a problem.\nThis is why so many rich people distrust the 'rich lists' and league tables of \nwealth published every so often in newspapers and magazines. We know that \nif we cannot calculate our true net worth, and if our paid armies of \naccountants cannot agree upon a figure, then compilers of lists and financial \njournalists certainly cannot do so with any real accuracy. In the words of the \nart collector and oil billionaire John Paul Getty: 'If you can actually count your \nmoney, you are not really a rich man.'\nA final caveat concerning the total asset value of rich individuals is almost as \nobvious. Above a certain limit, it doesn't really matter to them how rich they \nare - give or take the odd miser and the odd hundred million. That is, it ceases \nto matter unless you are one of the intended heirs. Then it matters. Boy, docs it \nmatter!\nYou might be surprised at the number of wealthy individuals who die without \nproper tax-planning, or even intestate - a fancy way of saying that someone \nhas died without a legally enforceable will in place. It is these 'intestate estates' \nthat so please the Chancellor of the Exchequer and his minions. It you die \nwithout a legally enforceable will, chances are the taxman will gobble up a \ngreat deal of what you left behind.\nThis next table, then, shows my take on a person's total net worth, assuming \nyou are not about to die, that you are prepared to take time to cash out such \nassets and, again, that you have low debt and live in a Western democracy.\nTable 2: Wealth Measured by Total Assets (True Net Worth)\n£1 milliore—£2 million                                The comfortable poor\n£2 million—£5 million                                The comfortably off\n£5 million—£15 million                              The comfortably wealthy\n£15 million—£40 million                           The lesser rich\n£40 million—£75 million                           The comfortably rich"

In certain circumstances the true net worth of an  \nindividual or family might be reduced by as much as half, if little or no tax-\nplanning has been undertaken.\nSo how rich do you want to be? The usual answer is 'rich enough to be happy'.\nBut riches do not confer happiness! I have lost count of the number of friends, \nlovers and acquaintances I have told tiiis to, especially when I first passed \nseven noughts of cash in hand. I don't bother any more. The incredulous look \non their face is always the same. What they are really thinking is: 'Well, \nmaybe you are not happy with all that dough, Felix. But I know that I would \nbe. Just try me!'\nStill, let me repeat it one more time. Becoming rich does not guarantee \nhappiness. In fact, it is almost certain to impose the opposite condition - if not \nfrom the stresses and strains of protecting it, then from the guilt that inevitably \naccompanies its arrival.\nEven leaving any moral dimension - heaven, camels and the eyes of needles - \nout of the equation, consider at least the wise sentiments of the author James \nBaldwin in his book Nobody Knows My Name, in which he concluded:\nMoney, it turned out, was exactly like sex. You thought of nothing else if\nyou didn't have it, and thought of other things if you did.\nBut let's face it, you didn't buy this book to be happy. You bought it in the\nhope it would provide pointers to becoming rich. According to my tables of\nwealth, 'rich' starts at a total asset value of £15-£40 million (also known as\n'the lesser rich').\nSo that's where we're aiming. For starters, anyway.\nAt the top end of that range, you might (just might, mind!) creep into\nthe last few places on the Sunday Times Rich List, compiled annually by\nPhilip Beresiford and his team of researchers. The STRL is the gold  \nstandard\nof league tables of the wealthy in Britain.\n\f\nYour rank then would be around '999 equal' of the top 1,000 richest\nindividuals and families in the UK. As far as the USA is concerned, your  \n£40\nmillion would place you nowhere on any major list. Except, perhaps, some-\nwhat high in the kind of esteem I described earlier among family, friends,\npartners, gold-diggers, stockbrokers, bankers and estate agents, Well, I did\nsay that £15-£40 million was only a start!\nOf course, all measurements are arbitrary. They are just an attempt by\nhumans to make some kind of order out of a chaotic universe. In and of\nthemselves, they are meaningless.\nQuite as valid a measurement of money as asset value or cash in the bank\nmight be 'Availability on Request' or 'Lifetime Spending Totals'. If you had\nno money yourself, but a fairy godmother gave you exactly what you needed\nwhenever you requested it, you would never make the Sunday Times Rich\nList, but you would be the richest person in the world, even if you gave\neverything away each night.\nAnd as for Lifetime Spending Totals (LSTs) as a measurement, I would\nlove to know how much various people have spent in the course of their life\n- including me. Sadly, I know I am never going to be able to figure it out,\nexcept for the certainty that I have spent hundreds of millions of dollars. My\nLST will have been eye-watering,\nI also know that because nearly all so-called 'old money' has to be\nprotected from any one generation's carelessness, their family wealth —  \nespe-\ncially property - is tied up in trust funds and entailments. In effect, many of\nthe children born into this 'old money' are as poor as church mice, simply\nbecause they cannot get their hands on the loot. They would have surpris-\ningly low LSTs. Clean fingernails and good manners, certainly; but low life-\ntime spending totals.\nNow, enough waffling about definitions. Let's get down to making some\ndough.\nLet's get rich!"

    "raw_text": "PART ONE\nR E A S O N S\nNOT TO\nGET RICH\n\f\n1\nPOLE POSITIONS\nNo task is a long one but the task on which\none dare not start. It becomes a nightmare.\nCHARLES BAUDELAIRE , My HEART LAID BARE\nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN, START YOUR ENGINES . . .\nFor a great many people, getting started on the road to wealth is the most\ndifficult part. Or so they believe. The nuances of each individual case need\nnot concern us, but the difficulties, as stated by virtually every wannabe I\never listened to on the subject, usually fall into one of three broad categories\n- often age related.\nIf young and relatively penniless, many will argue their lack of experi-\nence and capital (especially capital!) dooms them to decades of wage slavery.\nIf slightly better off and on the way up with a halfway decent job and\nperhaps the probability of further advancement, the problem is often\nconsidered to be the loss of what they have already achieved. Plus the\nlack of capital.\nBy the time one is a senior manager or professional, probably with a\ndecent house, a mortgage and children, it is the risk to the security and\nhappiness of the latter (and maybe to a spouse), plus the usual lack of capi-\ntal, which are most often cited as insuperable difficulties to taking the plunge.\nAll such objections to becoming rich are spurious, no matter how\nsincerely held. But before dealing with each in turn, let me digress for a\nmoment regarding upbringing, race, colour, educational  \nqualifications\nand gender .\nI am doing so here because I do not wish to waste anybody's time. We\nwill be touching on some of the circumstances described above shortly, but,\nin a nutshell, my experience has been that money is colour-blind, race-blind,\nsex-blind, degree-blind and couldn't care less who brought you up or in\nwhat circumstances.\nMoney is one of the most neutral substances on earth. Others may\nconspire against you obtaining it through bigotry or prejudice. But they can\nonly succeed if you permit them to.\n\f\nThe object of your goal, in and of itself, is non-sentient. If you truly\nbelieve that your race, sex or upbringing can keep you from becoming rich,\nthen you had best give up here. Either return this book to the shelf or, if you\nhave already bought it, return it to the bookstore for a refund or give it to a\nfriend. You may obtain the refund or please your friend.\nBut you will never get rich.\nYOUNG, PENNILESS AND INEXPERIENCED?\nIt's the same the whole world over,\nIt's the poor wot gets the blame,\nIt's the rich wot gets the pleasure,\nAin't it all a bleeding shame?\nVARIETY HALL SONG (c.1915)\nExcellent. You stand by far the best chance of becoming as rich as you please.\nYou have an advantage that neither education nor upbringing, nor even\nmoney, can buy. You have almost nothing. And therefore you have almost\nnothing to lose.\nYes, yes, I know you've heard all that before. But consider for a moment.\nNearly all the great fortunes acquired by entrepreneurs arose because they\nhad nothing to lose. Nobody had bothered to tell them that such and such\na thing could not be done or would be likely to fail. Or if they had been told,\nthen they weren't listening. They were too busy proving those around them\nwrong - without even meaning to.\nNot knowing that something cannot be done, you are likely to waltz into\nuncharted minefields where angels before you have feared to dance.\nAstonishingly, you may be fortunate enough to succeed, to some degree or\nanother. Conventional wisdom will then be revised by those around you and\nthe next generation will be taught that what you did can always or often be\ndone - only to discover, when they attempt it themselves, that in reality you\nmissed every landmine by pure, dumb luck.\nNever trust the vast mountain of conventional wisdom. It contains great\nnuggets of wisdom, it is true. But they lie alongside rivers of fool's gold.\nConventional wisdom daunts initiative and offers far too many convenient\nreasons for inaction, especially for those with a great deal to lose.  \nFortunately\n\f\nfor you, you do not have anything to lose and can afford to ignore the\n\"jobsworths' and Jeremiahs who have lived upon the mountain for so long\nthat they have come to worship it.\nNor is a propensity for risk-taking your only advantage. You have stam-\nina far, far beyond those who are twenty or thirty years older. The stamina\nnecessary for long, grinding hours of labour in the cause of getting rich.\nStamina enough to party all night and go straight back to work for a twelve-\nor sixteen-hour day. I remember such stamina fondly.\nYou have no idea how much the stamina of the young is envied by the\nrest of us. Along with a degree of callousness and enviable powers of speedy\nrecuperation from reverses, stamina is your secret weapon. Its attributes will\nsee you through a raft of catastrophes that would virtually annihilate older\nmen and women.\nIn addition, your instinctive knowledge of modern technology gives you\nanother edge. (All those hours spent playing computer or video games might\nnot have been such a waste after all.) At least you know the difference\nbetween an iPod and a JPEG. And knowledge is power, at whatever age,\nwhether earned by blood and tears or imbibed at a mother's breast.\nTreasure that instinctive knowledge. I still own half of the personal\ncomputing magazines in Britain - PC Pro, Computer Shopper, Computer\nBuyer, MacUser, Custom PC - in part because of an early addiction to pinball\nand electronic arcade games. While I knew nothing of computing (and still\ndo not), the instincts honed by countless hours of shoving money into slots\nforewarned me of their potential. The first few million pounds I ever\ntrousered  were a direct result of trusting instincts entirely at odds with\nconventional wisdom of any sort.\nTwo immediate examples leap to mind. As we will see in more detail\nlater, I published a series of eight-page full-colour, folded posters (with head-\nlines and articles printed on the back) and charged the same cover price as\nmagazines with ten times that number of pages. The result was dubbed a\n'poster-magazine' and sold millions of copies around the world. Nobody had\ntold me it couldn't be done because nobody had done it before.\nSimilarly, as previously noted, I launched half a dozen magazines about\na new fad called 'personal computing' back in the 1980s, even though British\nmagazine retailers and wholesalers at the time were unanimous in their belief\nthat 'nobody will ever buy them'. Those magazines have earned me tens of\nmillions of pounds in the last twenty-five years and are still earning me\nmoney today. Conventional wisdom is usually right. But when it is wrong, it\n\f\ncan offer quite extraordinary opportunities for those too stubborn or inex-\nperienced to pay attention to well-meaning naysayers.\nPerhaps most importantly of all, as a young and penniless and inexperi-\nenced person, you are not an 'expert'. Thus you are more willing to learn\nthan those in their thirties, forties or fifties. You are not afraid of making\nmistakes, admitting them when you do and getting right back on track.\n(Speaking of tracks, you have no track record to defend, either.)\nHere is a pearl beyond price and - Glory Hallelujah! - it cost you noth-\ning to obtain. Anyone not busy learning is busy dying. For as long as you\nfoster a willingness to learn, you will ward off sclerosis of the brain and hard-\nening of the mental arteries. Curiosity has led many a man and women into\nthe valley of serious wealth.\nAmbition, fearlessness, self-belief, stamina, a degree of callousness, a will-\ningness to learn. These are your advantages over the middle-aged and the\nold. 'Gather ye rosebuds while ye may!' Could you turn the clock back for\nme by forty years, I would willingly swap you every penny and every posses-\nsion I own in return. And I would have the better of the bargain, too!\nSo what does the future hold for a young man or woman determined to\nbecome far wealthier than their parents? Here is how I see it:\nThe way will most likely be hard, your failures many. It will be fun and it\nwill get a little hairy, even scary, at times. But the earlier you start and the\nmore risks you are prepared to run, tempered by listening hard and choos-\ning the right mountain (we'll come to that later), the more certain it is that,\nsooner or later, you will find yourself with a small success on your hands.\nAnd one success, with luck, will lead to another.\nIf there is a single category of person for whom this book should prove\nthe most useful, it is you: the young, penniless and inexperienced. I know.\nI've been there.\nAnd if I was lucky enough to find a way through, then so can you.\nStick with me, young brother or sister. You are suffering from nothing\nmore than excusable confusion and a lack of experience, conditions that will\npass with time, and whose passing can be expedited by fierce determination\nand application.\nBelieve it or not, I envy each and every one of you.\nSLIGHTLY BETTER OFF AND ON THE WAY UP?\n\f\nI have a bone to pick with Fate.\nCome here and tell me, girlie,\nDo you think my mind is maturing late,\nOr simply rotted early?\nOGDEN  NASH, 'Lines ON FACING  FORTY '\nThis is the point at which many people vaguely wonder about starting their\nown business, either on their own or with a partner or two. They have\nenough experience to know how the companies they work for function.\nPerhaps even how their industry functions. And they see a niche - as yet\nimperfectly filled. They have 'an idea'. (See Chapter 5: The Fallacy of the\nGreat Idea.)\nYet they hesitate. They fear losing what they have already achieved more\nthan they desire to enrich themselves. Personally, I am on more than famil-\niar terms with this syndrome. I meet it every day, because it affects (or\nafflicts) a great many of the fine men and women who run my own compa-\nnies. Perhaps even a majority of them.\nI employ a great many people smarter than I am. That's not false\nmodesty. That's a stone-cold fact. The only two reasons they continue to\nwork for me and put money into my pocket are that, on the positive side,\nthey enjoy their work, and on the negative side, they fear losing what they\nhave already gained - challenging work, congenial colleagues, a certain status\nand the promise of promotion and pay rises.\nThey know this as well as I do. (They are far from fools, otherwise I\nwould hardly employ them.) But fear holds them back, with the exception\nof those rare individuals who are content with their lot.\nAnd what is fear? 'Fear is the little death, death by a thousand cuts,' goes\nthe ancient Japanese saying. Nifty, but ultimately unhelpful. Similar to\nShakespeare's 'Cowards die many time before their deaths: / The valiant\nnever taste of death but once.'\nBut is fear really the father of cowardice? Let's leave that to the philoso-\nphers. In business, in the accumulation of wealth, it is an impediment, for\nsure. But then, so is recklessness. No, I believe that it is the fear of failure\nwhich looms largest here. And fear of failure is definitely something that can\nbe dealt with, and will be dealt with at length in this book. (See Chapter 3:\nHarnessing the Fear of Failure.)"

    "raw_text": "Outsiders are sometimes surprised at my reaction when people in this cate-\ngory, the Slightly Better Off and On The Way Up, decide to leave one of my\nown companies and set up on their own. I always wish them well. Not only\noutwardly, but in my heart, too. Often I throw a party for them. Or write\nglowing testimonials. Once or twice I have even underwritten their office  \nlease\nor introduced them to a banker or a lawyer I trust. Why do I react that way?\nThree reasons. Firstly, I'm proud of them. Proud that those who work\nfor me are brave enough, motivated enough and trained sufficiently well to\ngo for it on their own. Boldness attracts applause, as the writer and philos-\nopher Goethe once remarked in doggerel:\nWhatever you can do, or dream you can, begin it!\nBoldness has genius, power and magic in it.\nSecondly, it's win-win. If they fail, they may well return to our company,\nespecially if they remember that my senior colleagues and I sincerely wished\nthem success in their new venture. Thus, if they fail, the company will be\nenhanced by their return. While if they should succeed - then we will be all\nricher for having an old alumnus as a friendly rival in the industry, rather  \nthan\nhaving created a enemy who wishes us anything but well.\nLastly, it's because I fear them. I fear they may have spotted something we\nhave missed, some gap in the market. I fear we may have failed to listen to\nthem. I fear that their new venture will grow at our expense while it poaches\nour personnel and our market share. And the only way to deal with fear is to\ncosy up to it. To took it in the eye and pump its hand. To translate its nega-\ntive energy into adrenaline. To harness it. To laugh with it, rather than at it.\nPerhaps this could be you giving your current boss the scare of his or her\nlife? At the very least, providing your idea or venture has serious merit, any\nsensible company would attempt to buy you off. If they do not, then perhaps\nthey are not a company that deserves to benefit from your talents? It's a\nthought, isn't it?\nAs one who has been 'the boss' for longer than many of you have been\nalive, I can assure you that you enjoy much greater leverage than you might\nbelieve. But you will never find that out until you go for it.\nFor the Slightly Better Off and On The Way Up, now is the time to\nconsider whether or not you intend to continue making me (and people like\nme) even richer, or whether you wish to become rich yourself. You have little\n\f\ntime left in which to make up your mind. Your youth and stamina is ebbing\naway. You are getting too comfortable.\nIt is not a course lor everyone. But I think you can guess what my advice\nto you would be.\nWhat the hell. Go for it!\nSENIOR MANAGER OR PROFESSIONAL?\nPushy young turks are impatient for news —\nYoung Cinderellas are singing the blues -\nWannabees, just like you used to be ... Choose!\nWhose gonna fill this dead man's shoes?\n'DEAD MAN'S SHOES'\nWelcome! I'm surprised you could bring yourself to read such a book. It's a\ngood sign. It shows you're still curious. Still hungry. Not as hungry as the\npenniless lad or lass at the beginning of this chapter, of course. But then\nyouth is wasted on the young - and they have so much learning to do, do\nthey not?\nYOU, on the other hand, have learned much. There is little about your\ncompany you do not understand. little, too, about your industry that has\nescaped you. You have seen a great many fools take the plunge into freelance\nwork or set up in business on their own with such high hopes. And watched\nnearly all of them come crashing down in flames or creep through the bank-\nruptcy courts hoping nobody would notice.\nBut I bet you noticed. I'd bet my bottom dollar that you noticed.\nStill, there have been one or two who made it, haven't there? One who\neven suggested you take the plunge with her and cake a piece of the action?  \nWas\nthat the one you turned down? The woman who waves when she passes you\nin her Mercedes-Benz SLR convertible on her way to a golf club you cannot\nafford to join? From a house on the water with its own dock, apparently. The\none who is now far richer than she deserves to be? The one who got lucky?\nLet's face it, you were, and are, smarter than she is. Or ever will be.\nAnnoying, isn't it?\nBut you don't have to give up hope. With luck you'll make the board in"

    "raw_text": "2\nA MILLION\nTO ONE\nThere are three kinds of lies.\nLies, damn lies and statistics.\nTHOMAS CARLYLE, CHARTISM\n'Dare not' is one thing. 'Cannot' is another. Not everyone can be rich. But\nanyone can dare to. Somebody has to. Let's take a look at the arithmetic\nrelating to the odds.\nBy my earlier definition, only 0.000016 per cent of 60 million British\ncitizens are rich. That's less than 1 per cent of 1 per cent of 1 per cent of 1\nper cent of 1 per cent of the total population. If your best friend inherited\none million pounds and gave you 0.000016 of their windfall, you would\nreceive a princely sixteen quid. 'Hey! Thanks a bunch, old chum.'\nIf wealth were decided by lottery, you would have sixteen chances in a\nmillion of scraping into the top thousand richest people in the UK. To reach\nthe top fifty, you would have to do better. A lot better. Like one chance in a\nmillion, allowing that a fair percentage of the places in those leagues are\ntaken by those who inherited their loot - or a good chunk of it, anyway.\nThese are not very enticing odds.\nFortunately, less and less wealth is decided by the lottery of inheritance.\nOnly a quarter of the entries now in the Sunday Times Rich List in Britain\nfind themselves there due solely to inherited wealth. If, indeed, it is that  \nmany.\nTwenty-five years ago it was different story. Back then, nearly three-\nquarters of the buggers were force-fed their wealth from golden spoons. (In\nthose days, though, there were only 200 entries on the list.) Low have the\nmighty fallen! And they'll be falling further yet when another blasted nouveau\nriche like you, dear reader, elbows his or her way into the golden horde.\nIf you can, that is. Because not all of us are cut out for it. Let us explore\nfactors likely to exclude an individual from becoming rich. This is where we\nsort the wolves from the does, the prey from the predator and you from a\nlifetime of wage slavery.\n\f\nThere's health, for a start. People in poor health usually find it difficult,\nno matter how clever they are, to muster the stamina that becoming rich\ndemands. In any case, when you are really poorly, the allure of wealth  \nrapidly\nrecedes - except as far as first-class health care is concerned. (I can attest to\nthis from personal experience. Twice now I have survived life-threatening\nillnesses. Making money was not big on my list of priorities at that time. In\nfact, I was so far gone at one point, that I forgot to sue the bastards who\nwere responsible. Looking back, I must have been very ill indeed!)\nAs always, there are exceptions. The theoretical physicist, Stephen\nHawking, has been confined to a wheelchair for years with a rare and\nappalling disease. Yet he made a bundle with a book that very few people\nhave ever read right through to the end. A book that has sold millions of\ncopies, A Short History of Time. (And did you know he featured in an edition\nof The Simpsons?) My hat off to you, professor.\nWe must also factor in disadvantage and age. Not of colour, sex, race,\nreligion, upbringing or lack of education. None of those present insuperable\nhurdles in a Western democracy. But mental handicap, growing senility and\nthe physical decline of old age - none of which need be life-threatening in\nthe short term - virtually rule out any serious accumulation of wealth, except\nby inheritance or winning a lottery.\nSo that leaves the relatively fit and those not old enough to call them-\nselves old. Close to 40 per cent of the population of the UK are either old\nenough to have little hope of acquiring real wealth if they have not done so\nalready, or are too young to be able to acquire it in the short term, except\nby inheritance. If you fall into neither of these groups, you now have only\n35,999,000 people to beat.\nThat equates to twenty-five chances in a million of scraping into the top\nthousand richest people in the country. Still daunting odds.\nBut, wait! There are huge chunks of the population around you who either\nhave no desire to be rich or have chosen professions that rule them out of the\nrace. I asked a researcher to estimate for me the total number of people  \nwork-\ning for the government in Britain. (If you can afford it, always get someone\nelse to do the grunt work. Sec Chapter 13: The Joys of Delegation.) While\nit is theoretically possible for a civil servant to resign from their job and \nbecome\n\f\na multi-millionaire (especially, apparently, if they worked for the Ministry of\nDefence), the number of ex-civil servants in the Sunday Times Rich List is  \ntiny\n- two of them having inherited their wealth while parading in the corridors of\npower, and one who was  rich long before he became a minister.\nSo what did my researcher discover? Well, the number is astonishing.\nOver 5 million people work for the government in the UK in one way or\nanother and are unlikely ever to become rich. Your odds now have improved\nto twenty-eight chances in one million.\nAnd now look around you. How many of the people you work with, the\npeople you socialise with, the people you see in the street, do you think have\ndedicated themselves to getting rich, or are likely to do so any time soon?  \nOr\nhave the drive or aptitude to attempt to do so? Two per cent? Three per cent?\nFive per cent? Let's take 3 per cent, which I believe to be a massive overes-\ntimate, by the way. Personally I know only five acquaintances who dedicated\nthemselves to achieving success in business in order to make themselves seri-\nously rich. (As opposed to scores of senior managers or professionals known\nto me who dedicated themselves to success in their business life, but allowed\nothers to reap the main financial rewards of their labours.)\nThose five people, I might add, amount to a lot less than 3 per cent of\nall the people whom I believe could have become rich had they wished to do\nso. Or had they drummed up the confidence to try.\nSo - 3 per cent of the 30-odd million people still in the race amounts to\njust under one million rivals. To reach the top thousand earners among\nthem, all other things being equal, you have now shortened the odds to one\nchance in a thousand. Which is significantly better than the sixteen chances\nin a million we began with. Now you know what Carlyle meant by lies,\ndamned lies and statistics.\nLastly, in any list of reasons not to get rich, we must come to philosophy\nand the benefits of hindsight. If I had my time again, knowing what I know\ntoday, I would dedicate myself to making just enough to live comfortably\n(say £30 or £40 million), as quickly as I could - hopefully by the time I was\nthirty-five years old. I would then cash out immediately and retire to write\npoetry and plant trees.\nMaking money was, and still is, fun, but at one time it wreaked chaos\nupon my private life. It blocked me from beginning to write poetry until my\nearly fifties. It consumed my waking hours. It led me into a lifestyle of"

These afflictions, in turn, helped to undermine my health.\nBut like an old, punch-drunk boxer, I couldn't quit. I always craved just\none more massive pay-day. One more appearance under the lights with the\nroar of the crowd and the stink of the sawdust and leather. One more fight.\n'I can take this young punk. I know I can. Just this once, so I can go out as\na winner. So I can retire as the champ. Then I'll retire. Just this last one.'\nPathetic. I should have known better. There is no such thing as a perma-\nnent champ. After all, I co-wrote the first bestselling biography of\nMuhammad Ali back in 1974. (You'll find it, republished as Muhammad  \nAli:\nThe Glory Tears on Amazon.com.) And there isn't a single fan of Muhammad\nAli who does not wish he had quit the ring several years before his failing\npowers made the decision for him.\nIt's no excuse, but making money is a drug. Not the money itself. The\nmaking of the money. This sounds like so much hooplah, but it's true, all\nthe same. Nobody believed that exercise could prove addictive until science\nstepped in and discovered 'endorphins' or whatever the damn things are\ncalled. And making money, I assure you, is a hell of a lot more of a rush\nthan jogging.\nUp to just seven years ago I was still working twelve to sixteen hours a day\nmaking money. With hundreds of millions of dollars in assets I just could  \nnot\nlet go. Like I said, it was pathetic. Because whoever dies with the most toys\ndoesn't win. Real winners are people who know their limits and respect  \nthem.\nEventually I found a way out. I handed over day-to-day control of my\nbusinesses to younger and mostly smarter boys and girls. I cleaned up my\npersonal life. I began doing what I wanted to do - not what I felt I had to\ndo. After all, what did I have to prove? Except, perhaps, to myself.\nIt is possible that you will avoid such mistakes when you get rich. I hope\nso. One thing is for sure 'the usual afflictions' are no reason not to make the\nattempt. There is no reason on earth why financial success should lead to\npersonal catastrophe. Least of all the odds.\nThe odds may still appear daunting, but only to those lacking sufficient\nguts and determination to try. If the odds of getting rich put you off, then"

    "raw_text": "you deserve to stay poor. Or, to put it more kindly, whether you deserve it \nor\nnot, you will stay poor.\nBut we're done here with reasons not to get rich. Our ends are not fore-\ntold in our beginnings. The poet was wrong there. We're heading for our\nown version of The Glory Tears. We're on our way.\nIt's time to concentrate on getting started. To take the first step on the\nlong road to getting rich.\nPART TWO\nGETTING\nS T A R T E D\n\f\n3\nHARNESSING THE\nFEAR OF FAILURE\nGo tell the Spartans, thou who passeth by.\nThat here, obedient to their laws, we lie.\nJOHN DRYDEN, ON THE SPARTANS AT THERMOPYLAE\nTHE EIGHT-HUNDRED-POUND GORILLA\nThis is the 800lb gorilla. The King Kong of your nightmares. The reason,\nalmost certainly, that you have not already begun to make yourself rich. He's\na big bastard, so arm wrestling is out, but he's not quite as scary as you might\nthink. Maybe we can bribe him with a sack of bananas? Or poison him? Or\nteach him to sit up and beg? Let's see.\n'Not begun until half done,' lectured John Keats gloomily in a letter to\na relative nearly two hundred years ago, Keats was a sublime poet, who died\nwhen just twenty-five years old. Although he would rank well inside my own\ntop twenty favourite writers of verse in English, perhaps in the top ten, he\nwould have made a totally rotten entrepreneur.\nI would use, instead: 'Once begun - the job's half done.' Because taking\nthat first, irrevocable step has proved to be the most difficult part of nearly\nevery venture I have been involved in.\nIn the memorable words of the American philosopher and poet Ralph\nWaldo Emerson:\nNo matter how much faculty of idle seeing a man has, the step from\nknowing to doing is rarely taken.\nThere are so many reasons not to do anything, many of them highly persua-\nsive, especially in the mouth of a Jeremiah. And the world is full of\nJeremiahs. They infest our planet. In the living room, in the pub, in the\noffice, at the boardroom table. Everywhere you look, you will find men and\nwomen who appear to take perverse pleasure in pointing out the shriekingly\nobvious: that if a new venture does not succeed, it may result in failure.\nNot that they will say so in so many words. It would be so much easier\nto overcome the bulk of their objections if they did. Instead, they trot out\nfacts and figures, statistics and trends, charts and graphs, together with\nendless reminders of failures of the past, with especial emphasis on the fail-\n\f\nures of those lucky enough not to be in the room at the time. (There is rarely\nany mention of their own failures, in my experience.)\nThey will say the company or the individual does not have the resources.\nThat it has all been tried before. That 'the light isn't worth the candle'.\nThat outside advice is required or that an individual should seek further\ncounsel. That the individual or company is uniquely unsuited to such an\nenterprise. That it is too late, or too early, for such an idea to have any\nchance of succeeding.\nHow many millions upon millions of man-hours are wasted annually, I\nwonder, in all this doom-mongering? Personally, I've had a bellyful of it.\nAt the last extremity, as far as most company enterprises are concerned,\nthe Jeremiahs will call in the big guns, 'We must form a committee to inves-\ntigate the possibility of proceeding. That's the answer. A committee. Who\nshall we choose to chair the committee?'\nThis is the death knell, in nine cases out often, for any new venture. What\nlies behind it is the desire to apportion blame that may accrue later as  \nwidely\nas possible. If a committee is formed and eventually makes its recommenda-\ntions, then future blame for either action or inaction cannot be laid at any one\nperson's door. In business and political jargon, this nonsense is called 'collec-\ntive responsibility'. In common parlance, it is 'covering your backside'.\n'A committee is a cul-de-sac down which ideas are lured and quietly\nstrangled,' as Sir Barnett Cocks, clerk of the House of Commons, once\npointed out. Well, Sir Barnett should certainly have known. He served on\nenough of them. Or in the words of an anonymous American wit: 'A\ncommittee is a group of the unwilling, chosen from the unfit to do the\nunnecessary.' Just so. And they do it so brilliantly well. Whether in a college\ndorm, or in the walnut-panelled boardroom of an international conglomer-\nate, or around your own kitchen table.\nOf course, there is nothing wrong with robust debate, either with others\nor with oneself. What is undesirable, however, is the pretence that any such\ndebate can resolve the risks involved in advance. It cannot. All debate can do\nis clarify, support or contest the next step. The risks remain, however much\ntalking is done.\nIt is for this reason that committees are discouraged on the battlefield. A\ncommander may be proved wrong. He may be proved right. But prompt\ndecisions and orders, right or wrong, are far healthier than endless debate\n\f\nand prevarication. This applies equally to a debate within one's own mind.\nFretting is counter-productive at any level.\nAnd so is lack of action. Knowing that fear of failure is holding you back is\na step in the right direction. But it isn't enough, because knowing isn't doing,\nKnowing isn't doing what you need to do, my son;\nTelling me you know is only bluffing on the run;\nKnowing isn't doing;\nDoing isn 't knowing;\nNothing but the knowing and the doing  gets it done.\nFear of failure and the avoidance of blame, then, is what drives Jeremiahs  \nand\nhaunts them. To be fair, it haunts all of us. In essence, it comprises two\ncomponents. The first is our natural desire to avoid letting ourselves or\nothers down, perhaps with calamitous financial repercussions. The second is\nthe exposure of that failure to the outside world.\nThe majority of you reading this now are mentally nodding in agree-\nment. (Otherwise, why would you be reading a book called How to Get\nRich ?) No shame there.\nBelieve me, I have sat with colleagues and partners of long standing,\nmany of them highly experienced, and listened in disbelief while they have\ntalked themselves round and round in circles. Or figures of eight. Or any\nconfiguration designed to delay the agony of saying:\n'OK. Let's do it.'\nOr even: 'OK. Let's forget it.'\nAnd looking back, I have to say that I regret the majority of the times I\nacquiesced in shilly-shallying and a retreat to safety. I would rather have tried\nand failed, in most cases, than, have taken the safer course that so often\nappears to be wiser in the abstract.\nBack in the late 1970s, for example, I had a conversation with a much\nolder man, a senior manager at the high-street retailer, W.H. Smith. W.H.\nSmith are a power in the magazine and newspaper industry. This old buffer\nwas friendly and helpful towards my little publishing company. I was inter-\nested in launching a personal computer magazine. He dissuaded me, warn-\ning me over and over that 'nobody would ever pay money to read monthly\n\f\nmagazines about dinky little computers'. Several colleagues in my company\nagreed with him. After weeks of discussions, I abandoned my plans.\nShortly thereafter, another entrepreneur, Angelo Zgorelec, launched just\nsuch a title, called Personal Computer World. It soon exhibited all the signs\nof becoming a big success. Fortunately, Angelo did not have sufficient capi-\ntal to promote it. In the nick of time I was able to purchase a majority stake\nin the magazine, which I proceeded to sell for a small fortune four years later\nto a large conglomerate.\nSo what is the lesson here? Because I had been dissuaded from launching\nmy own title, and did not own the magazine outright, I was forced to pay\nAngelo a million pounds or so for his remaining share. Well done, Angelo!\nHad I launched, a similar magazine myself earlier, I would have been £1\nmillion richer in the autumn of 1982.  (Around £2.4 million in today's\nmoney.) If I had invested that £2.4 million at a low rate of compound inter-\nest, I would be £4 million richer than I am today.\nThat is what that well-meaning old gentleman at W.H. Smith and his\nlong-winded advice cost me. He cost me nearly $7 million in my pocket\nright now. And whose fault was it? It was mine, for prevaricating and listen-\ning to a Jeremiah.\nLet's return to the two components of fear of failure. Firstly, letting others\nor yourself down and the consequent financial calamity. My response is: so\nwhat? You may let others down if you act. You may let yourself down if you\ndo not act. And just how calamitous will utter failure prove to be, in any case?\nWhich, of course, is what gives the young and penniless such a huge advan-\ntage in the race to get rich. They instinctively know what Bob Dylan preached\nforty years ago: 'When you got nothin', you got nothin' to lose'.\nStill, potential loss is always an important consideration. Everything will\ndepend on the degree of desire and belief you bring to an enterprise. What\nare you willing to sacrifice to achieve it? How great is the sacrifice in reality,\nas opposed to your nightmarish tears at 3 o'clock in the morning? Does  \nsuch\na venture realty risk utter destitution? Or is it (far, far more likely) that you\nfear the embarrassment of failure more than the possible financial penalty.\nThis nastier, stickier second component, the 'broadcasting' of our\nmisjudgements or errors to the rest of the world, and especially to our peers,\nis often the nub of the matter. Whether I am sitting around with colleagues\nat Dennis Publishing trying to figure out if we should invest millions of\n\f\npounds to launch a new car magazine, or whether a young woman, an only\nchild not long out of college, is considering whether to take over her father's\nused-car business or invest another two years of her life into obtaining a\nPh.D. in bio-engineering - the same factors apply.\nNeither decision will involve utter financial ruin, either way. But fear of\nattempting something, the result of which cannot be easily hidden, weighs\nheavily in the balance, whether we are aware of it or not. This applies not\nonly to getting rich, but to almost all business and career-related decisions.\nAnd, perhaps, to the majority of all important decisions we make in our  \nlives.\nThe board of directors that runs Dennis Publishing will talk earnestly and\nsensibly about the effect on morale for the rest of the company (usually\nforgetting to mention their own morale) in the event our proposed new\nmagazine bombs. (Nobody ever mentions the loss to my personal bank\nbalance or my morale.)\nIn reality, Dennis Publishing staff working, say, on The Week or Maxim\nor Computer Shopper, won't give two hoots if the company's new car maga-\nzine is a sensational flop. But by discussing the matter in such terms, in code\nif you like, the board gives itself the opportunity to weigh their own fears\nwhile appearing to weigh the fears of others.\nImputing desires or fears or loss of morale to others probably has a fancy\npsychological monicker - like auto-displacement activity. And it's not  \nalways\na bad thing. At least it encourages serious communication, even if it adds little\nto the decision process. Even so, it is a form of well-disguised cowardice.\nOn a less corporate level, the young woman mentioned above believes she\nwould like a career in car sales management, especially as a part-owner. She\neven believes that she might be able to expand her father's business a tad  \nmore\naggressively than he has done in the past. On the other hand, a Ph.D. would\nadd status to her life and offers the prospect of a fulfilling career in science.\nBut she must decide. Her father is unwell and cannot wait another two\nyears for her decision. What if she takes over the company and it  \nsubsequently\ngoes belly up? What if she shoots for a master's degree and does not achieve  \nit?\nA failure to obtain her master's degree could be disguised fairly easily. It\n\f\nis not likely to be broadcast to the rest of the world. After all, she already has\na degree. If failure seems likely, she can always quit, claiming she has  \nbecome\nbored with bio-engineering. The decision to take over her dad's company,\nhowever, will be far more closely monitored — by relatives and neighbours,\nby the people who work there, by rival car dealerships, by the bank manager,\nand not least by her father. Should she fail, she will run the risk of  \nbecoming\na laughing stock or an object of pity.\nSo what is her best option?\nMuch will depend on her desires and her goals in life. She is unlikely to\nget rich as a bio-engineer. But she might well get rich expanding the dealer-\nship, especially because she is aware that her father has never invested to the\nextent that he might have done in marketing and promotion, especially on\nthe internet. There is an opportunity, but is she prepared to exploit it?\nWhy is she unlikely to get rich in bio-engineering? Because starring up\nyour own bio-engineering firm takes vast quantities of capital and the persua-\nsive abilities of a Richard Branson to obtain it. The car dealership, however,\nis already capitalised, and although she will have to pay off her father even-\ntually, the repayments can be spread over a number of years. He is hardly\nlikely to foreclose on her.\nSo what should our young college girl do? Normally, I would hesitate to\noffer any advice whatever. But I happen to know her. I was half in love with\nher once. She happens to be real and her name is Julie. All this happened a\nlong time ago.\nIn the event, she took her degree and her father sold the business to an\noutsider. She is a highly competent bio-engineer and has enjoyed her career\nenormously. But on more than one occasion, she has told me she regrets not\ntaking her father up on his offer. The passage of time and a happy marriage\nhave softened that regret. But it's still there. It will always be, I think.\nWhat swung the balance was her fear of failure in such a 'public' endeav-\nour. Or, at least, an endeavour that felt rather public at the time. She was\nyoung. She was a woman. She was frightened that others (especially the\nmale-dominated community of car sales firms) would laugh at her or  \ncriticise\nher lack of hands-on experience, even though she would have made an  \nexcel-\n\f\nlent sales manager. She was not prepared to grow a carapace or to risk the\nfear of public humiliation and say:\n'To hell with them. Let's go!'\nHer decision still haunts her, if only from time to time. And it irks her to\nknow that she will never be rich. It always irks intelligent people like Julie.\nAnd I can give you other examples. One of them is my mother. She will be\nfurious (if she ever reads this) that I have mentioned her in such a book and \nsuch\na context. But I know my mother well. I know beyond a shadow of a doubt \nthat\neverything I have achieved I owe not just to care and love, but to her genes.\nShe could have built herself a fortune had she wished. Her personality\ncombines the resilience, the drive and the restless energy of so many people\nwho become rich. Like her eldest son, for instance. And that resilience and\nrestless energy was always there with my mother. As it was with me. Right\nfrom the beginning.\nBut sixty years ago it was almost unheard of for a woman to act out such\nambitions. Her parents would have been scandalised. Neighbours would\nhave viewed such behaviour in the most negative light imaginable. Had she\nfailed, they would have nodded their donkey-like heads.\nAnd had she succeeded, horror of horrors, she would have earned their\nundying enmity. It just was not 'done' for a woman to earn a fortune for\nherself - except, somewhat dubiously, as a movie star perhaps. Or a writer of\ncrime novels.\nSingle or newly married women from respectable families in the 1940s\nand 50s were actively discouraged from involvement in business except for a\nlittle light typing or serving in shops and department stores. Especially if they\nhad children. Especially if they lived in the South of England. (And this after\nthey had helped to win a world war on the home front! But that was consid-\nered a vile aberration.)\nNever mind that my mother had more brains in her little finger than half\nthe twerps she worked for as an accountant. Why, women were not even\nallowed to sign a hire-purchase form back then. They had to get their\nhusband or their brother or their father to do it!\nThere were a hundred obstacles and hurdles in those days, visible and\ninvisible, to keep women in their place - which was firmly believed to be\n\f\non\na pedestal before marriage and in the kitchen and nursery directly  \nafterwards.\nFortunately for all of us, society has wised up somewhat; but the change\ncame too late for my mother.\nSo she didn't become rich. She had a decent career, that's all. She earned\nenough to support my brother and me and to provide us with more than just\nthe necessities of life. And she married again and became a pillar of the\ncommunity. But I know that she could have done it, had she been prepared\nfor the unpleasantness, the sheer nastiness that would have been unleashed\nupon her if she had chosen to say:\n'To hell with them. Let's go!'\nIt was not so much a fear of failure on my mother's pan, I believe, as a\nfear of upsetting the whole apple cart of the community in which she lived.\nWhich is why so very few women from her generation - so very, very few -\never did do it. They cared very much about what their neighbours thought.\nAnd now she is an elderly, if formidable lady who quietly walks her dog  \nalong\nEnglish country lanes.\nShe knows all this, of course. And she, too, knows that she will never be\nrich, except through her eldest son. Which is a subtly different thing.\nTo sum up then, if you wish to be rich, you must grow a carapace. A mental\narmour. Not so thick as to blind you to well-constructed criticism and\nadvice, especially from those you trust. Nor so thick as to cut you off from\nfriends and family.\nBut thick enough to shrug off the inevitable sniggering and malicious\nmockery that will follow your inevitable failures. Not to mention the poorly\nhidden envy that will accompany your eventual success. Few things in life  \nare\ncertain except death and being taxed. But sniggering and mockery prior to  \nany\nattempt to better yourself financially, followed by envy later, or gloating \nduring\nyour initial failures - these are three certainties in life. It hurts. It's mindless.\nAnd it doesn't mean anything. But it will happen. Be prepared to shrug it off.\nThe Germans have a superb word for the (secret) pleasure humans\nobtain from the misfortunes of others. It is Schadenfreude - from schaden\n\f\nmeaning 'harm' (from which we get the word 'shadow'), and. freude. mean-\ning 'joy'. Those of you who are definitely going to be rich will recognise it\noften enough in the faces and body language of idiots around you. It is the\nprice you must learn to pay for any attempt to raise yourself in the world.\nAnd I suspect that was as true ten thousand years ago as it is today.\nNow comes the hard part. Before we really get started on getting started,\nI ask you to consider carefully the short list below. It is by no means  \ncompre-\nhensive, nor will it be the last list in this book, but should you find yourself\nunable to measure up to even one of these initial demands (and I mean just\nowe), then my suggestion is that you close this book and give it to a friend,\nor an enemy - depending on the degree to which you enjoy ironical gestures.\nO If you are unwilling to fail, sometimes publicly, and even catastrophically,\nyou stand very little chance of ever getting rich.\nO If you care what the neighbours think, you will never get rich.\nO If you cannot bear the thought of causing worry to your family, spouse\nor lover while you plough a lonely, dangerous road rather than taking the\nsafe option of a regular job, you will never get rich.\nO If you have artistic inclinations and fear that the search for wealth will\ncoarsen such talents or degrade them, you will never get rich. (Because\nyour fear, in this instance, is well justified.)\nO If you are not prepared to work longer hours than almost anyone you know,\ndespite the jibes of colleagues and friends, you are unlikely to get rich.\nQ If you cannot convince yourself that you are 'good enough' to be rich,\nyou will never get rich.\nO  If you cannot treat your quest to get rich as a game, you will never be rich.\n\f\nIf you can dream — and not make dreams your master;\nIf you can think - and not make thoughts you aim;\nIf you can meet with Triumph and Disaster\nAnd treat those two impostors just the same ...\nRUDYARD KIPLINC, 'IF'\nO If you cannot face up to your fear of failure, you will never be rich.\nThe truth is that getting rich means sacrifice. And the worst of it is, it isn't\nalways you that's doing the sacrificing. You must get used to that, or give up\nthe quest. This is not a calling for the faint-hearted. There is no shame in\nturning away. After all, if everyone was prepared to make the necessary sacri-\nfices, who would be left to work for my own companies?\nQuite apart from sacrifice, there is a last brutal truth to be confronted. If\nthe fear of failure is holding you back - and it almost certainly is - then what\nstrategies can be devised to set you free? No book, including mine, can do it\nfor you. All I can do is alert you to the problem and suggest a course of action.\nHere is my suggestion. Think of this fear not as the King Kong of bogeymen,\nbut as a mare. A nightmare. A mare, after all, is a horse. A horse can be tamed,\nbridled, saddled, harnessed and (eventually) ridden. Harnessing the power of\nsuch a creature adds mightily to your own. Thus the nightmare of prospective\nfailure provides you with the very opportunity you are seeking. Not only does it\nrestrain smarter people than yourself from becoming rich - and there can only be\nso many rich people in the world - it affords you the chance of increasing your\nconfidence, both when you confront it and when you master it.\nFor make no mistake, if you will not confront and harness this all-too\nhuman emotion in one way or another, then you are doomed to remain rela-\ntively poor. You either get over it, go round it, go at it, mount it, duck under\nit or cosy up to it. But you cannot surrender to it. That way lies paralysis,\nprevarication, ignominy and defeat.\nAfter a lifetime of making money and observing better men and women\nthan I fall by the wayside, I am convinced that fear of failing in the eyes of the\nworld is the single biggest impediment to amassing wealth. Trust me on this.\nIf you shy away for any reason whatever, then the way is blocked. The\ngate is shut - and will remain shut. You will never get started. You will never\nget rich.\n4\n\f\nTHE SEARCH\nUntil one is committed, there is hesitancy; the chance to draw\nback; always ineffectiveness concerning all acts of initiative and\ncreation. There is one elemental truth., the ignorance of which\nkills countless ideas and splendid plans: that the moment one\ncommits oneself, Providence moves all. All sorts of things occur\nto help one that would never otherwise have occurred. A whole\nstream of events issue from the decision, raising in one's favour\nall manner of incidents and meetings and material assistance\nwhich no one could have dreamed would come his or her way.\nJOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE\nWAITING FOR GODOT\n'What do you want to be when you're grown up?' is the dreaded, inane cry\nfrom well-meaning aunts and uncles to infant children. This morphs soon\nenough into anxious queries about examination results. By the time college\nis on the horizon, many teenagers are ready to wreak physical violence upon\nadults who pester them with thinly veiled questions and tedious advice\nconcerning their future career.\nThis probably happened to you, just as it did to most of us. The best\nresponse I ever heard came a few years back from one of my godchildren, deliv-\nered with a serene smile and carefully articulated irony to a nosy neighbour:\n\"Oh, I'm going to be rap god, Mrs Milburn, and pimp half your Brownies.'\nThe Brown Owl who had asked him was anything but amused.\nJust at the very time hormonal chaos, acne, drugs, alcohol, sport, fashion,\ngadgets, cars, music, body piercing, partying and sex are emerging as matters \nof\ncompelling interest, we find ourselves faced with an eternal mantra about earn-\ning a crust. All of this is irritating in the extreme, mostly because it harps upon\nwhat is patently obvious - that one day we are going to have to make a Living.\nAnd yet, there is a kernel of wisdom buried in the pulp of these\nparental and family concerns. The truth is that the vast majority of people"

    "raw_text": "doing the asking did not choose their own career. Either they stumbled\ninto it or they were pushed.\nKnowing this, adults are often subconsciously seeking, however clumsily,\nto nag the young into confronting as early as possible the biggest decision\nover which any of us is likely to exercise real control. We do not choose our\nparents. We do not choose our nationality. We do not choose who we fall in\nlove with. We do not even choose the personality or character of the children\nwe bring into the world or even our own personal characteristics - random\nconfigurations of DNA do it for us.\nBut we do get to choose, if we are determined enough, what it is we want\nto do for a living. Most of us flunk this test. Me, for instance. My career as\nan entrepreneur magazine publisher came about entirely by accident. If you\nhad asked me when I was eighteen years old what I would be doing for the\nnext thirty years, I would have told you I was going to be one of the biggest\nR&B singers in the world.\nThat didn't happen, and if I'm honest about it, I'm still a little disgusted\nwith myself that I quit the dream so early. But, hey, I was getting tired of\nstealing food and bumming other people's cigarettes and not having the rent\nmoney. It was no fun shinning down a drainpipe to ensure I avoided meet-\ning my landlady in the hall.\nAnd in any case, I had an appointment. It wasn't one of my own choos-\ning, but it came along all the same,\nESTRAGON: Charming spot. Inspiring prospects. Let's go.\nVLADIMIR We can't.\nESTRAGON: Why not?\nVLADIMIR: We're waiting for Godot.\nSAMUEL BECKETT, WAITING FOR GODOT\nWho never arrives. So is it such a terrible thing that the vast majority of us\nsettle for what comes along rather than making a career plan and sticking  \nwith\nit? And how do you get to decide what career you might excel at anyway?\nMost parents and teachers reading this are not going to like my answer.\nIt's this: none of it matters a damn if you want to get rich.\n\f\nThis is not to say that 'the Search' is not important to young people. It's\nimportant and it's scary and it's fun and infuriatingly confusing. For most\npeople, it occurs in their twenties or very early thirties. For a small number,\nthe Search is over by their teens, either because they have a shriekingly obvi-\nous talent or because they have already spent too many hours hanging out in\nthe wrong company.\nFor the rest of us, though, the Search is a lot scarier than we usually care\nto acknowledge. And this arises, ironically, from the success of Western\nDemocracies, those with a capital 'W' and a capital 'D'. They have provided\ntoo much choice for younger citizens. Nobody but an idiot would deny this\nis a good thing - even a wonderful thing. But choices are confusing. They\ntake time to consider, to sample, spit out and reject. And too many of them\nprovide a ready-made excuse for procrastination and shilly-shallying.\nNot to mention fantasising. It came as a shock to me to read in The Week\nthat 20 per cent of British teenagers in school claim they would abandon their\neducation if they could just get themselves on television. In any capacity  \nwhat-\never. Just to be a 'celebrity'. Which probably explains the queues clamouring\nto be humiliated on 'reality TV', a modern equivalent to ancient Rome's glad-\niator circuses. That is, it came as a shock until I remembered my own  \ncertainty\nat seventeen that I would knock The Rolling Stones flat on their ass.\nAll of us have our dreams. And these are not to be despised or mocked.\nThey are a part of us, whatever they are.\nIf you want to serve your fellow man, then go do it (and God bless you).\nIf you want the status of being a professional - a professor or a lawyer or an\neconomist, then go do it. If you want to be secure so that you can marry and\nraise kids, then choose the civil service, because bureaucrats never go out of\nstyle and pensions for senior civil servants these days appear to be gold-\nplated. If you want to be a world-class writer, musician or athlete or movie\nproducer, then go do it - it won't be that long before you discover whether\nyou have the talent to hack it or not.\nIn other words, if you feel absolutely moved towards a particular voca-\ntion, then that's exactly where you should head. But be aware that if you\nwant to make huge sums of money, then earning a living by slowly swarm-\ning up the greasy pole is rarely the way to do it.\nFor a start, the salary begins to have an attraction and addictiveness all of\n\f\nits own. A regular paycheck and crack cocaine have that in common. In  \naddi-\ntion, and more to the point, working too long for other people can blunt  \nyour\ndesire to take risks. This last factor is crucial, because the ability to live with \nand\nembrace risk is what sets apart the financial winners and losers in the world.\nIf you want to be rich, you are not looking for a 'career', except as a\nlaunch pad or as a chance to infiltrate and understand a particular industry.\nA job for the rich-in-training is merely something to keep you ticking over,\nto put food on your plate and wine in your glass.\nAdditionally, it will provide excellent training in man-management and\nnegotiation skills; it will supply inside market information; above all, it will\nact as a salutary reminder of what happens to 99.99 per cent of your\ncolleagues - the ones who buy lottery tickets and dream of becoming rich\nbut who haven't a hope in hell of achieving any such thing.\nSounds pretty arrogant and selfish, doesn't it? Not exactly 'playing the\ngame' or exhibiting what a human resources manager would call 'a construc-\ntive team attitude'. But then, who ever heard of a rich human resources\nmanager? Right. Neither have I. And, in any case, if you do the thing right,\nthere is no reason why such a manager need ever know. Or care.\nSo if you want to be rich and you are in the Search phase of your life,\nthen get used to one thing. You are not part of a team— although you may\nhave to pretend you are. To put it more politely, you may have to adopt the\nidea of teamwork, for the time being, to help yourself understand better how\nindividuals, departments, companies or industries function.\nYou should certainly do so enthusiastically and conscientiously. But in\nyour secret heart, however hard you work (and if you want to be rich, work-\ning a damn sight harder than the punk next to you is the only sensible\noption), you must not be deceived.\nWorking for others is a reconnaissance expedition; a means and not an\nend in itself. It is an apprenticeship and not a goal.\nYou should have no long-term, or even medium-term, requirements of\nthe first two or three companies you work for. Promotion is always welcome\nand brings with it the opportunity to learn more, but you are there to ensure\nthat you take every opportunity to suck out the marrow of what you need to\nknow, to understand it and place it within a greater context for a future\n\f\npurpose. The purpose of getting rich.\nTeam spirit is for losers, financially speaking. It's the glue that binds the\nlosers together. It's the methodology employers use to shackle useful\nemployees to their desk without having to pay them too much. While lives\nmay depend on it in a few professions, like soldiering or fire-fighting, in\ncommerce it acts as a subtle handicap and a brake to ambitious individuals.\nWhich, in a way, is what it's designed to do.\nHere's an example. Back in the early 1980s, I launched Star Hits maga-\nzine in the USA. It was based on the highly successful pop-music rag Smash\nHits in Britain,\nI negotiated a deal with EMAP, the owners of Smash Hits, to pay them a\nsmall royalty on each copy we sold in America. In return, they helped me to\nhire a couple of their Smash Hits staff who were willing to relocate to New\nYork City and work for me there. One of these guys was an editor called Neil\nTennant, a young man with a wry smile and the look of eagles about him.\nLaunching a magazine is an exhausting process. Most magazines fail\nwithin two years, and although it lasted a little longer than that, Star Hits\nwas destined for a short, if spectacular, existence. But we didn't know that in\n1984. British pop groups were popular at that time in America - especially a\ngroup called Duran Duran. Being associated with the mighty Smash Hits in\nEngland gave us an edge in obtaining photographs and interviews. Star Hits\ntook off like a rocket in America.\nIn no time at all we were selling hundreds of thousands of copies each\nmonth. Letters from readers arrived in their thousands from every corner of\nthe country and the sacks piled up in the hall of our pokey New York City\nmidtown offices. The staff of Star Hits worked all hours of the day and night\nand were fiercely determined the magazine should succeed. Nearly all of  \nthem\nwere young, and for some of them this was only their second or third job.\nMy small company's financial resources were limited, which meant that\npeople on the magazine were often promoted quickly, Neil Tennant quickly\nfound himself the editor of one of the hottest magazines in America. New\n\f\nYork City lay at his feet. His desk was entirely swamped by tottering piles of\npromotional material sent by record companies. He could get backstage at\nany gig, from huge arenas like Madison Square Garden to hip, crowded\nnightclubs downtown. Managers and PR agents vied for his attention. He\nflew anywhere he wanted and interviewed whoever took his fancy. This was  \na\ndream job and Neil was on top of the world.\nMorale and team spirit in the office were high, too. Staff were not\nrequired to wear suits or ties and as long as the job got done, nobody cared\nwhat anyone looked like or bothered them with corporate rules or red tape.\nNeil and the staff of Star Hits were having a whale of a time. I was kind of\nenjoying it myself.\nLate one afternoon he sauntered into my office. He was holding a\ncassette tape which he tapped with his fingernail as he slumped on a battered\nchair and stared at me, half sheepishly, half defiantly. 'Felix, I'm going to\nleave Star Hits,'' he said. 'I've been working on some numbers and I think I\nhave a real chance of making a go of it. Listen to these and tell me what you\nthink.' Later that evening I played the tape (which I still have in my\narchives). It was not my kind of music, but one particular song, 'West End\nGirls', I think, was a stand-out. I had vaguely known of Neil's personal inter-\nest in recording, but had never dreamed he would risk such a fantastic job\nfor the vagaries of becoming a pop star.\nI went to work on him the next day. How I would be happy to pay him\nmore money. How Star Hits was poised on the brink of greatness. How he\nwould be certain to be offered even more glamorous editorial jobs by my\ncompetitors if he stuck it out. Above all, I pointed out how disappointed and\nlet down his editorial team would be.\nNo dice. Neil was right. The Pet Shop Boys became huge stars. On his\nlast day, at a small office leaving party, he told me that within a year he would\nmake the front cover of Star Hits in his own right. And he did, too!\nWhen it comes right down to it, 'team spirit' and not letting your\ncolleagues down is a feeble reason for procrastination when opportunity\ncomes knocking. Nearly always, it is an excuse to avoid the possibility of\nhumiliating failure. If one of the team you work with inherited ten million\nquid tomorrow, do you really believe they would be checking in to keep up\nmorale? Of course not. Neither would you, or anyone in their right mind.\n\f\nWhich leads us to a note of caution. Those who can never be rich may\nnot want you to become rich. That's an ugly thing to say, but unless you\nrealise and accept that you cannot be 'one of the boys', that your bosses and\nyou are not 'in this thing together', that only those who refuse to be conned\nby the idea of 'team spirit' in the workplace can succeed - unless you come\nto fully comprehend and understand all this, then you will only make other\npeople rich. You will receive their heartfelt thanks and maybe a gold watch\nwhen you retire. But you will not get the money!\nIt's the same with close friends and family members. Consciously and\noutwardly they may want you to succeed beyond your wildest dreams. But\nsubconsciously, often without being aware of it themselves, they might be  \nfar\nhappier if you failed or only succeeded to a limited degree.\nIt's a selfish world out there. But, hey! when you've piled up your first\nfew million in the bank, you can salve your conscience by giving  \ngenerously\nto your relatives. Or by promoting young managers and waffling on to\nthem about 'team spirit' in your own business. Not that the brightest of\nthem will believe you for a moment. (They're the ones you promote fastest,\nby the way.)\nWhat else is there to consider during the Search? Some industries are\nmore enticing and glamorous than others. Some require huge investment to\nget off the ground and some can be made to work in an attic or a garage.\nAnd some are growing while others are in decline. Should you choose only\nto work in glamorous, growing industries? Where is the most opportunity to\nbe found?\nFirst off, forget glamorous. One of the richest self-made men I know digs\nholes in the ground to dispose of household waste. That's not how his\ncompany describes itself in its annual report, but essentially that is what it\ndoes, along with building incineration plants.\nGlamorous? No. But in a good year he puts £20-£30 million on the\nbottom line and earns a gross margin of over 20 per cent. That's a sensa-\ntional result for a small, wholly owned private company. Not to mention that\nthe relentless growth of the packaged-goods industry ensures that his busi-\nness will grow and grow virtually by default - providing he can find enough\nplaces to dig holes, that is.\nWhile you may not necessarily want to be in a glamorous sector of any\nmarket, and they are often very crowded sectors, it helps to be in\n\f\none. Swimming with the ride rather than against it, so to speak. A swelling\ntide raises all boats, including yours.\nOn the other side of the 'glamorous' coin, very few of those who want\ntheir picture on the front cover of Vogue, or wish to become a movie direc-\ntor or to run the coolest PR company in the world, get to achieve anything.\nThe reason is obvious. The laws of supply and demand are absolute - and\nthey apply not only to commodities, but to people. Too many people want\nto make a blockbuster movie and live in Beverly Hills. Not enough people\nwant to dig holes.\nNew or rapidly developing industries, whether glamorous or not, very\noften provide more opportunities to get rich than established sectors. The\nthree reasons for this are availability of risk capital, ignorance and the power\nof a rising tide.\nInvestors are drawn to emerging industries in the hope of making a fast\nbuck. To get rich, you will need capital, and to acquire capital you need to\nbe where loose capital is searching for a home. In addition, the combination\nof ignorance and misconception that surrounds any new market or technol-\nogy works in your favour. If you are quick at grasping concepts and jargon,\nyou become an 'instant expert'. The owners of capital love 'experts'.\nFinally, the power of a rising tide masks many start-up difficulties,\nputting individuals and small companies on a more even footing with\nconglomerates and established operators; for a while, at least.\nI've had personal experience of this craziness. Back in the late 1970s I\nknew nothing of personal computers. And I mean, literally, nothing. The\nonly PC I had ever seen was built by a nerd from a kit. It appeared to allow\nthe nerd and his fellow nerds to play a pathetic video game called 'Pong'. On\ntop of that, it permitted like-minded nerds to converse with each other in a\njargon beyond the understanding of non-nerd mortals. To sum up, PCs were\nfor trainspotters.\nThis was not exactly promising ground for an entrepreneurial publishing\ncompany. Even so, the enthusiasm of these nerds and of science journalists in\nthe mainstream press concerning the potential of personal computers was\ngrowing. To cut a long story short (and a story which has still not ended\nthirty years later), my tiny little company became 'instant experts' on personal\ncomputing. We launched magazine after magazine on the subject, both trade\nand consumer based, and established several exhibitions.\nOur acquisition of apparent 'expert' knowledge, together with all our\n\f\nnew launches, bred respect among our vendors, primarily paper merchants\nand printers. They vied to offer us far better credit terms than they would\nnormally have considered offering. This provided me with desperately\nneeded capital to expand.\nAs magazine publishers, we could not hold a candle to our bigger rivals,\nand no one knew this better than they. But at least we appeared to know\nwhat we were doing, which in turn attracted editorial talent who really did\nknow. Better still, the tide of personal computing technology rose high -\nhigher than anyone could have predicted, and it rose quicker than anyone\nhad thought possible.\nHere was the power of a new market at work. By the time our bigger\nrivals were comfortable enough to launch against us (a hesitation resulting\nfrom ignorance), the tide had carried us beyond the reach of their big guns.\nNew capital, ignorance and a rising tide had done the trick. In this instance,\nthe Search had paid off in spades.\nAs a general rule of thumb, then, growing industries with relatively low\nstart-up costs offer more opportunities for those who want to get rich than\ndeclining industries, or those that require huge start-up investment. This is\nnot an iron-clad rule, however. While magazine and newspaper sales have\nbeen in slow decline in the Western world for decades, this 'declining' indus-\ntry is where I made a great deal of my own money.\nMore important than any particular industry are the sectors within each\nindustry. A sizeable fish in a growing sector, however small, is more attrac-\ntive to prospective purchasers and investors than the same size fish in a\ndiminishing or static pond.\nThis is one of the factors in stock-market bubbles - all growth is good\n(as far as investors are concerned), while all decline is fatal. I happen to\nbelieve that such sentiments are flawed. But what I believe is immaterial. It's\nwhat the providers of capital believe that counts, no matter how illogical.\nAfter all, what are banks and venture capitalists but usurers who offer you an\numbrella when the sun is shining and snatch it away the instant a few rain\nclouds appear? (Ah, the old jokes are the best jokes.)\nI do know of a few examples of self-made multi-millionaires from static\nindustries, especially in commodities, publishing and precious metals, who\nwere lucky enough to persuade banks and venture capitalists to back them\nwith millions of dollars. Of course, this means that they rarely remain in\ncontrol of their own destiny.\n\f\nCapitalism demands that whoever takes the most financial risk calls the\npiper's tune. The biggest rewards go not to those individuals who came up\nwith the idea, nor to those individuals who built the empire. They go to\nthose entities or individuals who funded the enterprise and own the most\nstock. Always bear this in mind during the Search.\nThis is the system you are pledged to both join and beat. To join because\nyou need to get rich. And to beat because you have insufficient capital.\nEither by appearing to join those who will financially back you (while hold-\ning on grimly to every piece of stock you can), or by piecing together just\nenough success to borrow enough money to grow without disposing of your\nsacred shares, (See Chapter 12: Ownership! Ownership! Ownership! )\nDepressingly, the only way for a start-up entrepreneur to succeed is often\nto part with equity in return for an infusion of capital. But never forget that\nno matter what promises or verbal guarantees you receive from investors\nduring the Search, the issue will eventually come down to control. And\ncontrol, even by a single per cent of the shares of a business, the fabled\n51-49 per cent split, is often the be-all and end-all of the game. (See Chapter\n6: Obtaining Capital .)\nWhoever controls a business can force its sale. Whoever controls a busi-\nness can implement a merger. Whoever controls a business can fire you.\nWhoever controls a business, even by a pitiful 1 per cent, is likely to take a\ngreat deal more money out of it than the minority shareholders. Remember,\ntoo, that in both private and public companies, not all shares are necessarily\nequal, either in voting power or financial value. Choosing a growing industy,\nor growing sector of a static industry, can free you from such financial\ncontrol freaks.\nTo gain control of a company, investors often pay well over the odds.\nHowever, those still clinging to the residue, even though they are protected\nfrom 'oppression' by the majority shareholder in law, rarely see equal value\nwhen all is said and done. For a minority shareholder who helped found a\ncompany, this can be a bitter pill to swallow. They may even have sold some\nof their shares to ensure the company's viability, only to discover that having\nwon such a battle, they have lost the war.\nThis is especially true in start-ups, and even more true in start-ups that do\nnot require substantial capital investment. While engaged in the Search \nyourself,\nspare a thought for the software giants of today, most of which were founded \nin\n\f\nbasements, spare bedrooms and garages a quarter of a century ago. They went\nthrough the Search themselves. The search for a niche. The search for  \nfunding.\nOnce upon a time, the chance was there, for those who could see it, to\nget in on the ground floor of this potentially huge industry. To most of the\ngeeks and nerds who slaved away creating primitive operating systems and\napplications (for which there were no known uses), one or two percentage\npoints of their tiny companies appeared to them to be, literally, neither here\nnor there. Few inventors or 'creative types' make very good managers or\nbusinessmen, in case you hadn't noticed.\nBut today, those one or two percentage points would be worth hundreds\nof millions of dollars in hard cash. Inch by inch, share by share, the nerds\ndiluted to gain capital to expand and survive. Eventually, the majority of\nthem lost control of their tiny companies. Many became salaried employees\nof the company they had helped to found. Much depended on whether they\nlost control prior to or after a public stock offering, but we needn't go into\nthat here.\nJust a few, a very few, held on to enough stock to become immensely\nwealthy. Ownership is power. Ask Bill Gates of Microsoft or Larry Ellison of\nOracle. But don't ask the guy who claims to have invented the world's first\ncomputerised spreadsheet. Last time I heard, he was living on welfare in a\ncrummy district of San Francisco.\nBut we are getting ahead of ourselves. The division of spoils comes only\nwhen there are spoils to divide. So how to choose the arena in which you\nintend to carve yourself a fortune? There are usually three factors involved in\nthe Search; inclination, aptitude and fate.\nWe all have inclinations of one sort or another. To me, spending an after-\nnoon inside the bonnet of a classic car with an oily rag for company is my\nidea of hell. Yet a retired friend of mine works on the two classic Rolls-\nRoyces I own whenever he gets the chance - and enjoys it so much he  \nrefuses\nto accept payment. On the other hand, how many other people would\nconsider working eighteen hours straight on a complicated poem as a way to\n'enjoy' themselves? There's 'nowt as strange as folk', as my Yorkshire friends\nnever tire of reminding me.\nYour inclinations really do count. You have to pay attention to them. If,\nlike me for example, you abhor television, then it probably isn't a good idea\nto move into that industry, unless you had a yen to direct or write for the\n\f\nsmall screen. A different thing entirely than watching TV night after night.\nIf you love art, but cannot paint or sculpt to save your life, then perhaps\nyou can still make your millions in the art world - providing you possess not\nonly a natural affinity and sense of aesthetic, but the wit to spot and winkle\nout talent in young artists. Plus the ability to sell, which is usually nothing\nmore than a talent for hype and keeping a straight face as you demand a fifty\ntimes mark-up from potential buyers who wouldn't know a Damien Hirst\nfrom a pickled sardine.\nAn understanding and passionate affinity with any subject, in combina-\ntion with effective management, sales and marketing techniques, could well\nprovide a tailor-made solution to the Search. Cherish your inclinations and\naffinities. Though not infallible, they may well lead you in the right direc-\ntion. But do not fall into the error of making a fetish of your passion. You're\nreading this book to get rich. Not to confirm your own prejudices regarding\nthose talents or inclinations you may have.\nBecause aptitude is a very different kettle of fish. Few of us are lucky\nenough to be born with a talent so obvious that the Search is never an obsta-\ncle to progress. Yet even here, inclination may prove a stumbling block to  \nreal\nwealth. One of the best sales people I ever employed, and one who was so\nconscious of her ability that I was forced to pay her nearly twice the salary  \nand\nbonus of her immediate boss, now lives in Cornwall and paints watercolours.\nThey are not very good watercolours, in my opinion. But neither my\nopinion, nor the promise that she would be a multi-millionaire before she was\nthirty-five, proved a sufficient inducement to keep her nose to the grindstone.\nThe aptitude for selling advertising was obvious, and was the envy of all her\ncolleagues. But her inclinations led elsewhere. She is happy as far as I know\nand I wish her all the luck in the world. But she will never be rich.  \nFortunately,\nshe says she has no wish to be.\nSo how do you judge your own aptitudes? Trial and error is the only way\nI ever heard of. The problem is that we create an image of ourselves in our\nchildhood and youth (often at the urging of parents, siblings or friends), and\nsubsequently attempt to graft reality onto this image. More often than not, the\ngraft doesn't take and the result is bewilderment and disappointment. Far\nbetter to ruthlessly analyse what your particular aptitudes are and act upon\n\f\nthem rather than attempt to graft an oak tree onto a dandelion.\nIf you are still young, here is where the advice of a godparent, a trusted\nteacher or lecturer, or even a career counsellor can prove usefull, bearing in\nmind that impartiality is a better guide than parental pride. Your parents,  \nlikely\nas not, will be of little use here. Their love for you may well blind them to the\nharsher realities of your true abilities and potential. There are a great many\ndoctors and lawyers who apprenticed themselves to their profession solely to\nplease an ambitious parent - only later to regret their acquiescence at leisure.\nIf you do decide to ask for advice concerning your true aptitudes, then\npreparation shows you are serious and will be more likely to effect a serious\nresponse. As a godparent, I am always willing to discuss the matter, but  \nonly\nif my godchild has prepared a list of questions and suggestions, and only in\nprivate. Casual conversations around a family living room, with others stick-\ning their oar in or trying to show off with banter and smart remarks, are\ntedious and counter-productive. For ambitious young people this is a serious\nmatter and deserves to be taken seriously.\nOf course, such discussions cannot make you rich. But they can really\nhelp in the Search. They can build confidence, a key element in risk taking,\nand the only way I know of to get rich from a standing start. And they can\ninform you, too, of your weaknesses, which in turn can protect you from\nspending your working life making other people rich - the probable fate of\nnearly everyone you currently know.\nIf you are older, and by older I mean in your thirties, then the matter\nbecomes far more difficult. I would say almost impossible, as far as advice is\nconcerned.\nHow many of us at that age know somebody to whom we can say: 'What\ndo you truly believe my strong points to be?' and expect a meaningful\nanswer? And even if we can find someone we feel comfortable discussing\nsuch a subject with, how many of us know anyone whose opinion is worth\nthe potential embarrassment? Blind faith and trial and error are just about all\nthat's left unfortunately. There ought to be a better way, but no one I know\nhas ever stumbled across it.\nInclinations are easy to list. Aptitude is far less so. Trial and error,\ncombined with fierce determination and a willingness to discard cherished\nperceptions about ourselves, is the best that I can suggest."

    "raw_text": "It is highly unsatisfactory and frustrating that the most important decision\nwe are likely to consciously make leaves so very much to chance. A small \nsuccess,\nthough - even a tiny success - can provide a clue. It was my own success at \nsell-\ning magazines on the street that. led me to begin to publish them eventually.\nWhich leads to fate. To chance. To serendipity. And, to a lesser extent,\nto the shared social delusion of the supernatural. I do not believe myself to\nbe any more superstitious than the next person, although it is true that I find\nmyself knocking on an actual piece of wood just a little too often for comfort.\nEven so, as a history and biography buff, it always amazes me how the self-\nmade rich appear irresistibly drawn toward the mines in which they will exca-\nvate their fortunes. What led them there? How did they know where to turn?\nIt is the instinct to seize an opportunity when it presents itself that\nperhaps sets apart the self-made filthy rich from the comfortably poor, the\nwillingness to ignore conventional wisdom and risk everything on what\nothers consider to be folly. One could even argue that it hardly mattered that\nyoung Henry Ford was drawn to automobiles, or that Ruben Rausing chose\npackaging, or that Bill Gates gravitated to software to create those vast\nfortunes. I would be open to persuasion that had their roles, and the century\nin which they lived, been reversed, they would have done just as well and\nraised themselves every inch as high from the common herd financially.\nTheir ability to take chances and to subsequendy exploit initial success\ncounted more than their inclination towards a particular industry. Their\nexecution of a strategy trumped the subject of their obsession.\nLuck? Fate? Chance? Although I am reluctant to even write these words,\nwithout them, it appears, nothing can be done. (See Chapter 10: A Few\nWords About Luck .) While it infuriates me to admit it, there are just too\nmany people I am acquainted with who appear to draw bad luck to them for\nthis not to be so. If the influence of luck is a delusion, then all I can say is\nthat the delusion is virtually universal.\nThe filthy rich are not gods. They are men and women who put on their\nunderwear in the morning pretty much as you do. It is true that they were in\nthe right place at the right time and did the right thing. The difference is that\nin some way they placed themselves in fate's way, then grasped her by the \nfore-\nlock as she sprinted past. ('Lady Luck is bald behind', says the old proverb.)\n\f\nTo put it less fancifully, they w rere lucky in the Search and skilful in their\nfollow-up. Boldness helped. Conquering fear of failure helped. Persistence\nhelped. But, without some luck, no one can get anywhere in the search to\ndiscover the exact arena in which to do battle, the arena that suits an indi-\nvidual's aptitudes and inclinations.\nBoldness? The most successful generals or admirals in military history\nshared one characteristic: they were willing to ignore orders and risk utter\ndisgrace in order to exploit rapidly changing circumstances. When the\nchance came, they recognised an opportunity, weighed the odds swiftly, and\nplaced their lives and careers on the line to snatch a victory. (Not to mention\nthe lives and careers of those around them.)\nThe three great quotes concerning 'luck' for me are these:\n'Luck is preparation multiplied by opportunity.'\nSENECA, ROMAN PHILOSOPHER\n'The harder I practised, the luckier I got.'\nGARY PLAYER, GOLF CHAMPION\n'Luck is a dividend of sweat. '\nRAY Kroc, MCDONALD'S FOUNDER\nFortune favours not just the brave but the bold. Boldness has a kind of  \ngenius\nin it, as Goethe pointed out. It can lead to complete failure and defeat,\nbecause conventional wisdom often proves to be at least wisdom of a kind.\nBut should boldness succeed, should the chance be seized and sufficiently\nwell executed, then success will surely lead to glory.\nAll around us, every day, opportunities to get rich are popping up. The\nmore alert you are, the more chance you have of spotting them. The more\npreparation you have done, the more chance you have of succeeding. The\n\f\nmore bold you are, the better chance you have of getting in on the ground\nfloor and confounding the odds. The more self-belief you can muster, the\nmore certain will be your aim and your timing. And the less you care what\nthe neighbours think, the more likely you are to take the plunge and exploit\nan opportunity.\nHere is the key, then, in the Search. Whatever your inclinations, your\naptitude, your abilities or your preferences, never shrink when opportunities\narrive. If you have weighed the odds and find yourself convinced, ignore the\nprotestations of sensible people and their conventional caution.\nSeize Lady Luck by the forelock and hang on for your life. More men\nand women have become rich by this single tactic than all 'the best-laid plans\nof mice and men' guided by plodding strategy.\nChances come to everyone in life, in all shapes and sizes, often disguised,\nand more often radiating risk and potential humiliation. Those who are\nprepared to analyse the risk, to bear the humiliation and to act in deadly\nearnest — these arc the 'lucky' ones who will find themselves, when the music\nstops, holding a potful of money.\nBut then, in reality, they made their own luck. They never stopped\nsearching. Perhaps they spent months or even years searching in the wrong\nplace. Or possibly they hit upon the object of their search at the first attempt.\nNo matter.\nHaving found what they needed where they needed it, and having done\nwhat they judged needed doing, their search is over. And it is they who will\nbecome rich.\n5\nTHE FALLACY OF\nTHE GREAT IDEA\nBetween the idea\nAnd the reality'\nBetween the motion\nAnd the act\nFalls the shadow\n\f\nT. S. ELIOT, 'THE HOLLOW MEN'\n'I'VE JUST HAD THIS GREAT IDEA . . .'\nThe novelist and poet Vladimir Nabokov may have been coming it a bit high\nwhen he told an interviewer in the mid-1960s that 'great ideas are hogwash' \nand\nthat 'style and structure are the essence of a book'. In the real world, at least,\nideas are not hogwash. But they are very unlikely to make you rich on their \nown.\nMore importantly, it really does not matter who gives birth to any partic-\nular idea. This is borne out by the laws relating to patents and inventions.\nYou cannot patent an idea. You can only patent your own method for imple-\nmenting an idea. It is for this reason that so many people have become rich\ndespite never having had a single great idea in their lives. As it happens, I\ncount myself among them.\nIt is good to have a goal. True believers in a 'great idea' are often\nobsessed with achieving a particular goal. Such an obsession, properly\nharnessed, can produce wealth. Sadly, that wealth rarely finds its way into the\npockets of the person whose obsession created it. As far as this book is\nconcerned, their goal was flawed even though their aim was true.\nTake a small example. Decades ago, my old friend Tony Elliott was deter-\nmined to force British television and broadcasting companies to permit him\nto publish their forthcoming programme schedules in his London weekly\nmagazine, Time Out. The BBC and ITV, among others, were aghast. They\nwere making a fortune by licensing their schedules for the week ahead  \nexclu-\nsively to Radio Times and TV Times.\nTony's great idea was simple. He wanted to break that cosy monopoly and\nforce the broadcasters to release their schedules to any publisher who\nrequested them. Alongside Time Out reviews and listings of movies, plays,\nconcerts, restaurants and all the rest, he planned to include a comprehensive\ntelevision-viewing guide. This was certainly a laudable goal and not a bad \nidea.\nBut the goal, in and of itself, could only produce so many extra readers.\nIn addition, should he succeed, this would mean that a great many other\npublishers would obtain access to these television schedules and publish\nthem in their own magazines. Many of these publishers were rivals, at least\non the newsstand, to Time Out. In addition, taking on the television broad-"

    "raw_text": "casters in a long drawn-out legal battle was likely to be an expensive under-\ntaking. To sum up, was the light worth the candle?\nTony thought so. He sought allies and found them. He spent real money\nin legal fees on his campaign. He became obsessed with this goal for a  \nwhile,\nor at ieast, it seemed that way to me, ignoring even his own staff's concerns\nthat there might be more important battles to fight and more pressing issues\nto address.\nEventually, after a long and gruelling battle, Tony won a victory. But\nonly a victory of sorts. Television broadcasting schedules, to a degree, moved\ninto the public domain. Many magazines could now publish them.\nAnd what happened? I expect Time Out's sales went up, briefly, when its\nfully fledged television listings appeared. But I would bet considerable\nmoney they did not go up anything like enough to repay the legal costs and\nlost management time Tony must have incurred.\nWorse still, it was mostly other magazine publishers in Britain who\nreaped the real harvest, and continue to do so. Today, UK retail shelves are\ngroaning with magazines that carry television Listings. Tony's great idea was\na great idea. But it proved to be an even better idea for other publishers.\nFortunately, Time Out has since gained a large UK subscriber base and\nhas stabilised newsstand sales in Britain, Better still, it has established several\nforeign editions, most notably in New York City, which have done vastly\nmore to improve Tony's fortunes than his noble battle with the emperors of\ntelevision all those years ago.\nHaving a great idea is simply not enough. The eventual goal is vastly\nmore important than any idea. It is how ideas are implemented that counts\nin the long run.\nGood ideas are like Nike sports shoes. They may facilitate an athlete who\npossesses them, but on their own they are nothing but an over-priced pair of\nplimsolls. Specially adapted plimsolls may be a good idea. But the goal is  \nstill\nto win, and sports shoes don't win. Athletes do.\nAnd yet I have lost count of the number of men and women who have\napproached me with their 'great idea', as if this, in and of itself, was some\npassport to instant wealth. The idea is not a passport. At most, it is the means\nof obtaining one."

    "raw_text": "Ray Kroc, of McDonald's fame, did not invent the idea of 'fast food'.\nHumans have been stuffing their face 'on the run' since the dawn of history.\nHis genius was merely to recognise this fact and implement a simple five-\npoint plan: standardise the food and prices, franchise the outlets, produce the\nfood swiftly in clean surroundings, offer value for money and market the\nwhole shebang relentlessly.\nEasy to state; hard to implement. And it flew in the face of all conven-\ntional wisdom concerning the sale of fast food at the time.\nBut it was the implementation of th is plan that turned a 52-year-old milk-\nshake-mixer salesman with diabetes and asthma into a billionaire. Every\nclement of his plan had been 'discovered' years before. There were thou-\nsands of 'fast food' outlets in the USA at the time, including a few owned by\nthe McDonald brothers, from whom he purchased his own outlets.\nYet it was Kroc's McDonald's that emerged as the ultimate market\nleader, not just because of a 'great idea' but through unremitting sweat and\nadherence to core principles. Personally, I despise fast food, and consume it\nonly when there is no alternative. But Ray Kroc's story remains a testimony\nto the ability of an entrepreneur to change the face of an industry - and make\nhimself very rich in the ptocess.\nThere is another side to the subject of ideas in commerce. Stealing them.\nOr to put it more pleasantly, emulating them. The error of failing to  \nemulate\na winning idea pervades every industry at all levels. Mainly this is due either\nto indolence or to folly. Of indolence, no more need be said. The folly, on\nthe other hand, often takes the shape of a peculiar affliction, known collo-\nquially as the 'it wasn't invented here' syndrome. I would place this affliction\nvery high on the list of reasons preventing individuals and companies from\nachieving major success.\nWhy people should be loath to emulate success is a matter for psycholo-\ngists. The fact that they do is a matter of fact. The result of such ostrich-like\nbehaviour can be catastrophic. As I discovered to my cost.\nDennis Publishing had been involved in magazines featuring computer and\nelectronic games from their beginnings in the 1980s. We had competitors, of\ncourse, but we were certainly a big part of the UK market. What we didn't\nknow was that we were about to take a massive pasting from a smallish rival.\nEnter Chris Anderson, who founded Future Publishing. Chris had two\ngreat ideas, which he executed perfectly. Firstly, he was prepared to pay the\n\f\nlikes of Sony a king's ransom to secure the publishing rights to magazines\nsuch as The Official Sony Playstation Magazine. Secondly, he put his maga-\nzines in a bag and also popped into the bag a playable electronic game.\nAll this meant that Future's magazines were more expensive to produce\nthan their competitors and more expensive on the newsstand. It also meant\nthat Future Publishing did not own such magazines themselves. The intel-\nlectual property rights were licensed from the hardware manufacturers. In\nthe end, The Official Sony Playstation Magazine did not belong to Chris. He\nwas just the publisher.\nThe thought of publishing a magazine I did not own was offputting to\nme. Nor was I that keen on handing over millions of dollars in advance to\nhuge companies like Sony or Sega. Thus Dennis Publishing stuck to produc-\ning 'unofficial' magazines in the games market. Sounds smart, right?\nOur costs were less, although we were forced to scrabble around\nconstantly, attempting to locate second-rate games to include in our bagged\nissues. Future's games were top of the line, because they were 'official'. (By\nnow, most readers had come to expect a 'free' game with every electronic\ngames magazine they bought.)\nThe result was predictable. Future Publishing wiped the floor with\nDennis Publishing in the computer and electronic games magazine market.\nReaders didn't care about the magazine. They cared about the free game in\nthe bag. Manufacturers of games were reluctant to allow us to buy their\ngames to put in our bags, because we published only 'unofficial' titles. In\nessence, the market was a monopoly and Dennis Publishing had backed the\npirates and lost.\nIn the end, we sold those few Dennis Publishing games magazines that\nwe had not already folded to Future at 'fire-sale' prices, (Well, maybe not\nfire-sale prices, but nothing like as much as I would have wished to receive!)\nThey had pasted us; and we deserved to be pasted.\nAnd yet, this process took years. Year after year, we plugged away\nattempting the impossible. We invested heavily on the internet and  \nproduced\na successful games portal - which we also sold to Future. The Dennis inter-\nnet games portal was more successful than our magazines. Why? For the\nsimple reason that we were not fighting with one hand tied behind our back,\nas we were on the newsstands with the 'official' versus 'non-official' brand-\ning. On the internet, at least, we were not perceived as 'pirates'.\n\f\nIt wasn't that Dennis wouldn't fight, or that we lost heart. But we were\nnot prepared to emulate Future and invest the money to acquire 'official'\nlicences ourselves. Even when we did try with a later games platform,\nMicrosoft's X-Box, our rivals were smart enough to pay way above the odds\nto shut us out of the market.\nFuture's template was there. Their success was obvious. Dennis had the\nfinancial resources, or could have borrowed them at a pinch. But we hated\nto admit that we w'ere wrong, and by the time we had come to grips with\nour idiocy, Future had signed up virtually all the 'official' games magazine\npublishing rights that mattered. Even today, I shudder at the thought of the\nwasted blood, sweat and treasure we expended on our games magazines.\nDennis Publishing failed in the electronic games market because we\nwould not (and later, could not) emulate a winning idea. My managers\nargued, both at the time and in hindsight, that the licences themselves were\nimmensely difficult to obtain and that Sony's dominance precluded success\n\f\nonce Future had obtained it. All this may be true, but why then did we\ncontinue battling what amounted to a monopoly for so long in the same old\nway? The answer is that we found it repugnant to admit that Future had hit\nupon the right idea and that we had refused to emulate it.\nWhat I should have done was to have taken my best men and women in\nthe company and send them to Japan, Europe or America. Or anywhere\nwhere Sega, Sony and Microsoft and the rest would agree to meet with us. We\nshould have wined, dined and cosied up to them. We should have searched\nfor another vehicle via which the popularity of such games could be  \nexploited.\nIf no other vehicle could be found, we should have tried trumping\nFuture's offers worldwide. Cash is a great persuader. If this wouldn't fly, we\nshould have exited the market. We did none of these things, in any meaning-\nful way, and we paid the price. We were pasted because we refused to  \nemulate.\nOn a less painful note, let's take a look at what happens when you are\nprepared to emulate an idea and execute it brilliantly. In May 1994, Britain's\nlargest magazine publishing company, IPC, launched a magazine for young\nmen called Loaded. This was the brainchild of its editor, Jarnes Brown. How\nBrown had persuaded the 'suits' at IPC to permit this stroke of genius\nremains a mystery, although I can personally testify to James's powers of\ncharm and persuasion in a clinch,\nLoaded was the first of the so-called 'lad' magazines and its success created\na new genre, simultaneously threatening old-guard titles like E squire and GQ\nwhile racking up colossal newsstand sales. Loaded was a breath of fresh air  \nin\nthe men's magazine market: irreverent, funny, subversive and addictive.\nJames's timing was impeccable. This was the ink-on-paper version of the  \nBBC\nsitcom Men Behaving Badly or the sports quiz They Think It's All Over. Every\nother consumer magazine publisher in England was consumed with envy.\nIPC's deadly rival, EMAP, immediately set about revamping a tiny men's\nfashion title they had acquired called FHM (For Him Monthly), possibly the\nworst-named magazine in history. But names don't count, as pop groups like\nThe Rolling Stones or the Beatles demonstrate.\nFHM became a copy of Loaded, with a twist of its own. It avoided\nmadcap elements, for which the latter was infamous, and had a slightly  \nsexier,\n\f\nmore sophisticated image. Right from the start, FHM courted advertisers as\nhard as they courted readers. EMAP correctly identified that the top brass at\nIPC were somewhat embarrassed by Loaded's brash tone, and had conse-\nquently skimped on the title's advertising sales and marketing resources.\nIn addition, FHM forged links with tabloid newspapers like the Sun,\nproviding them with exclusive use of their photo-shoots of female celebrities\nin bikinis in exchange for publicity. Within a very short time, FHM had\nestablished an unassailable lead in the British 'lads' publishing market, a lead\nwhich neither Loaded nor Maxim (Dennis Publishing's launch in 1995) has\never been able to assail.\nThe success of FHM in the UK demonstrates the power of emulation,\nespecially when executed with verve and confidence. I am told that the\nBritish edition of FHM put £12 million on the bottom line the year before\nlast. EMAP deserves it. (Of course, that wasn't quite the case in the Maxim\nvs FHM battles abroad - but that's a story for another day.)\nThe lesson is clear. Despite the words of the old rock 'n' roll song, the\noriginal is not the greatest. Not always. If you want to be rich, then watch\nyour rivals closely and never be ashamed to emulate a winning strategy.  \nThey\nmay josh you a little for doing it, but that's a price well worth paying.\nThe problem with the great idea is that it concentrates the mind on the\nidea itself. This is fine as far as it goes. But unless the idea is executed effi-\nciently and with panache and originality, then it doesn't matter how great\nthe idea is, the enterprise will fail. Ideas are certainly of immense impor-\ntance, but I have seen so many people attempting to create a start-up\ncompany who have become obsessed with proving that their idea was 'right'\nrather than obsessed with making money. And I have watched them wast-\ning years doing it.\nNobody really cares if an idea is 'right', except the person who came up\nwith it. Apple (on whose computer I am typing these words) is a case in\npoint. Begun by two 'nerds' in a garage, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak,\nApple took off with its Apple II computer more than a quarter of a century\nago and, after a difficult period with the ill-fated 'Lisa' model, hit pay dirt\nwith the Macintosh computer in the mid-1980s. More recently, its iPod\nmusic storage device has transformed the consumer technology landscape.\nLet me make it clear that I am a loyal customer and great fan of Apple.\nI bought a Lisa back in 1983 or thereabouts. I bought the first Mac the next\nyear and have proceeded to buy nearly every new model since. For twenty\n\f\nyears, my company has also published the world's finest Macintosh  \ncomputer\nmagazine, MacUser. I know the company and their products well, at least\nfrom an historical perspective.\nBut Apple have a problem. They have always had a problem. His name\nis Steve Jobs. Steve has been a victim of the fallacy of the great idea over  \nand\nover again. Back in 1984, Apple were poised to take over the world of\npersonal computing. All their larger rivals, including IBM, were in disarray.\nThey just didn't get the personal computer revolution. Jobs and Wozniak\ndid get it.\nApple's products were innovative, slick, cool and far, far superior in every-\nway to any other personal computer available at that time. In tact, they were\nso cool their users often spent a great deal of time proselytising for the  \nApple\ncause. Users like me, for instance. So why is Apple such a small part of the\npersonal computer market today? The answer is Steve Jobs.\nSteve comes up with or encourages brilliant ideas. He has the guts to\nback them and to see them through. He is smart, passionate and a great man.\nBut he will not admit he is wrong and he would, apparendy, rather go broke\nthan make such an admission. It was Steve, I am told, who insisted that the\nearly Macintosh computers should be 'closed boxes' and that the Mac oper-\nating system would never be shared or licensed to other manufacturers.\nA description used by Apple marketeers at the time was that the Mac was\nlike a Cuisinart - a food blender - and did not need to connect to the rest\nof the world. A Mac could do for you whatever you wanted to do with a\ncomputer. It would not compromise itself by sharing the opportunity to\ncommunicate with lesser machines or devices.\nThe hardware would be Apple, the accessories would be Apple, the soft-\nware would be Apple. No open architecture. No compromise with the 'jerks'\nrunning the big old-style computing companies who were flexing their\nmuscles and salivating at this burgeoning new market. Steve Jobs would not\nshare his operating system, as IBM and others subsequently did. His attitude\ntowards all rivals (and I have witnessed this at first hand) was astonishingly\narrogant. I'll bet it still is.\nThere is a story from the early days of Apple, which I like to believe is\ntrue, of Jobs being invited to the CEO's office of a huge rival computer\ncorporation. Steve parked his bum on the corner of the great man's massive\n\f\ndesk, leaned over and told him: 'I am going to bury you. Apple is going to\nbury your company.' No he didn't. They buried him.\nThis arrogance, and belief that only his (or his company's) ideas are right,\nis the dark side of the fire that has driven Apple up and down a financial\nroller-coaster for nearly thirty years. Jobs is the saviour of the company.  \nJobs\nis also a man who appears to be in thrall to what he sees in a mirror.\nIt is not true that there is a large sign on Steve Jobs's desk at Apple which\nreads, 'My Way or the Highway' - but the fact that so many people believe\nthere is such a sign tells its own story. Apple's innovations and ideas (as  \nwell\nas its corporate arrogance) are a legend in the computer industry. Those\nideas, and their eventual execution, are often world-beaters.\nBut an idea is not enough. It is never enough. And even its successful\nexecution as a piece of technology is not enough if the company refuses\nto join with the rest of the world and its own customers in cooperative\nexploitation.\nEven Apple's iPod, a stunning technological and marketing achievement,\nis designed to keep the rest of the world at bay. To get songs downloaded\nonto an iPod, you have to go to the Apple music store on the internet. No\nother source of music (officially) connects with an iPod. Why? Because it is\n'My Way or the Highway'. It is classic Steve Jobs.\nJust as he did two decades ago, I predict that Steve Jobs will take his\ncompany to the top of the share-price mountain and then race downhill with\nthem under an avalanche of 'lesser' rivals and mortals who will conspire to\nconnect with each other and thieve Apple's customers. If it wasn't so tragic,\nit would be hilarious.\nThe story of Apple is a morality tale, a tale of the great idea wrapped in\nthe passion of one man (once Steve Wozniak had departed), wrapped in a\nball of arrogance, wrapped again in a shell of marketing genius. It's great\ntheatre. It makes for wonderful stories in financial newspapers and technol-\nogy websites. It is a joy to behold for those who know the historical context.\nBut it is nor smart business, except in the short term, before 'lesser' men have\ncaught up. And except for Steve Jobs.\nWithout Jobs, Apple could never have risen from obscurity to become a\nworld-class brand. But with Steve Jobs, Apple will always attempt to mould\nthe universe to fit Steve's vision of Apple, and will pay the price again and\n\f\nagain and again. 'Lesser' companies and men will filch their ideas, connect,\nconnect, connect, and beat Apple at its own game.\nSteve Jobs is not a monster. He is an all-American maverick and a world-\nclass marketing genius. But until a man or woman as powerful as he is  \narrives\nat Apple (over his dead body), who is determined to break the cycle he has\nindulged in for so many years, Apple will remain merely an icon of awe. It\nwill not become a company of the size that truly could (and should) 'bury'\nmonsters like IBM.\nSo if I believe all this, why do I use Apple computers? I use them because\nthey are better computers. Far better than any other personal computer  \navail-\nable on the planet. And because I was in at the beginning and still feel in\nmyself the incredible excitement that Wozniak and Jobs stirred in what they\ncalled 'the rest of us'. I am still one of 'the rest of us' and will remain loyal\nto Apple products. In my heart of hearts, too, I wish Steve Jobs and Steve\nWozniak had buried their corporate rivals. But then, I was always a sucker  \nfor\nthe underdog.\nAs for Mr Jobs himself, you should understand that the 'character flaws'\nI have harped on about in the preceding paragraphs, if flaws they are, have\nmade him an insanely rich man. Far, far richer than I could ever hope to be.\nHis Pixar film animation company has been extraordinarily successful and has\nnow been purchased for nearly $7 billion, yes seven billion dollars, by \nDisney.\nSteve is the majority shareholder in Pixar. He has now become the\nbiggest stockholder in Walt Disney's old media monster. Not bad for a guy\nwith 'character flaws' who started in a garage, eh! Let us hope he helps revive\nthe fortunes of that venerable old beast.\nEven so, beware of the great idea. You must encourage great ideas and\nsearch for them diligently. But either you control and develop such ideas or\nthe ideas will come to dominate your waking thoughts. And that would not\nbe such a great thing. Not unless you are Steve Jobs.\nI just took a break and went down to a local bar to watch the sunset and\nsink a few beers. There, I was foolish enough to mention this chapter, The\nFallacy of the Great Idea. A wise gentleman on the barstool next to me, who\nhas stewardship of more money than I will ever think about, reminded me\nof the phrase attributed to the American philosopher and poet, Ralph Waldo\n\f\nEmerson:\nIf a man write a better book, preach a belter sermon, or make a better\nmouse-trap than his neighbour, tho' he build his house in the woods, the\nworld will make a beaten path to bis door.\nThere's the power of a great idea, Felix,' he smiled.\n'Not so,' I countered. The operative verb is 'make'. It is not 'think up',\nor 'dream up'. It is 'make'. The idea would be worthless, no one would beat\na path to any door, unless they heard that the mouse-trap had been made.\nI read that Google, the tremendously successful internet search engine in\nAmerica, encourages certain staff to spend 20 per cent of their working time\ndeveloping their own pet ideas. It will be interesting to see how this plays\nout. Googie raised so much money upon its flotation on the stock market\nthat many Google employees became millionaires overnight. Will such\nmillionaires, with a Ph.D. in computer engineering, be content to make\nGoogle even more money? Or will they strike out on their own? Will there\nbe lawsuits relating to exactly where a particularly successful idea was devel-\noped? It will be fascinating to see.\nIf you never have a single great idea in your life, but become skilled in\nexecuting the great ideas of others, you can succeed beyond your wildest\ndreams. Seek them out and make them work. They do not have to be your\nideas. Execution is all in this regard.\nIf, on the other hand, you spend your days thinking up and developing\nin your mind this great idea or that, you are unlikely to get rich. Although\nyou are likely to make many others rich. That is usually the way of it.\nIdeas don't make you rich. The correct execution of ideas does.\n6\nOBTAINING\nCA PI TA L\nNo one would remember the Good Samaritan\nif he'd only had good intentions.\nHe had money as well."

    "raw_text": "MARGARET THATCHER\nDOLPHINS, SHARKS AND FISHES\nThere are only six ways of obtaining capital. You can be given or inherit it;\nyou can steal it; you can win it; you can marry it; you can earn it; you can\nborrow it.\nThe first four of these are beyond the compass of this book. All I will say\nabout 'winning it', presumably by gambling, is that the odds are very bad\nindeed. It's no way to get rich.\nIt is true that certain people exhibit incredible ability in games of skill like\npoker. But in the end, the losing streaks always seem to become longer and\nthe winning streaks shorter. Gambling, even for those at near genius level, is\ntime-consuming and totally exhausting. As for games of chance, I will not\ninsult your intelligence by discussing them. The Lottery is merely a pleasant\nname for organised racketeering.\nAs to theft, leaving aside the morality of it, I do not believe the light to\nbe worth the candle. The downside is too high and the upside too uncertain.\nShould you succeed in stealing a great deal of money, you will then spend\nmany years looking over your shoulder in fear of discovery. As Shakespeare\nput it:\nSuspicion always haunts the guilty mind;\nThe thief doth fear each bush an officer.\nMarrying into money has a nice ring to it. But rich in-laws often know very\nwell - very much better than your innocent spouse, in fact - why it was you\nmarried. That's not to say it doesn't work. I knew a KGB colonel who is now\nan arms dealer based on his divorce settlement. And I know a therapist who\nmarried into an old-money pile. But I wouldn't exactly describe their road\nto riches as uneventful. Apart from jealous spouses extracting their pound of\nflesh, both men appear restless and are quick to take offence if they think\nothers are sneering at them. (Which, of course, we sometimes are).\nThe French socialist Pierre Proudhon had the right of it: 'Property is\ntheft !' he thundered. Aye, so it is. But it is legalised theft, the main pillar of\nWestern capitalism, a rotten and debased system of managing human  \naffairs,\nand yet the only system that has survived the demise of all rivals.\nHowever we may feel about it, capitalism is the only system under which\nreaders of this book are likely to labour. And as its name implies, it requires\n\f\ncapital for those who wish to play the game and succeed.\nAs to the fifth method of acquiring capital - earning it - this is a long-\nterm game plan, although it is true that if you can demonstrate the ability to\nearn money early on, it does become somewhat easier to borrow from others\nsuccessfully later.\nBut for the majority of rich people who started with nothing, borrowing\nmoney in one form or another becomes a necessity sooner or later. Let's\nexplore the various options on the borrowing front.\nFirstly, avoid sharks like the plague. Perhaps you have read stories about\npeople who launched a small company by taking out a dozen credit cards  \nand\njuggling their cash limits for a few months to obtain capital?\nIt makes for heroic reading, but it isn't smart. Your credit rating is\nextremely precious. The interest rates on credit cards or similar instruments\nare beyond the capacity of nearly any legal business to sustain, and while \nbank-\nruptcy laws have become more generous to creditors in recent years, a history\nof bankruptcy will plague and hinder you when you seek to return to the  \nfray.\nThere are other predators in the sea, too, but nearly all of them demand\npunitive rates of interest. Anyone who has borne the burden of a loan that\nsucks the lifeblood from you week after week, month after month, leaving\nyou exhausted and no further forward than when you started, will tell you\nwhat a terrible price such borrowings exact from the human spirit. Better to\nlabour as a wage slave than as a beast of burden to a loan shark.\nIt's not all doom and gloom, though. While it may not look like it to\nyou, there is simply too much money in the world; too much capital seeking\ntoo few investment opportunities.\nThat, at any rate, is what you'll read in the financial press from the\nmouths of investment bankers, venture capitalists, mutual fund managers\nand from a new breed of gunslingers on the block, hedge fund managers.\n(Hedge funds, according to Fortune magazine, by the way, are mutual funds\nwith the 'ability to short stocks and deploy exotic financial instruments'.\nWell, bully for them.)\nIf you wouldn't know a hedge fund from an asparagus bed, welcome\naboard. I can assure you though, based on decades of owner/manager expe-\nrience in both private and public companies, that asparagus beds do have\n\f\none\nthing in common with hedge funds. Manure. Tons and tons of manure. The\nonly people I ever met who got insanely rich from a hedge fund operation\nwere (you guessed it!) the managers of hedge funds.\nSo how come it's so difficult to locate capital if there's so much of it about?\nThe simple answer is that the amounts of money you probably have in\nmind are way too small. And 'small' can work on many levels. In 2004 my\ncompany did the rounds of New York City banks and institutions. We were\nlooking for a measly S20 million at a reasonable rate of interest spread over\nfive or six years for a specific purpose. No dice. We were offered $100  \nmillion\ndollars, no sweat - but only if the providers could cut themselves in for 'a\npiece of the action'.\nThis seemed crazy to me. I had plenty of security and was merely look-\ning to borrow a little money, not lumber my company with an 'end-game\npartner'. Eventually, we found what we needed, but we had to come back to\nEurope to do it.\nSo what had happened? Many US providers of capital of any stripe now\nonly wish to play ball in return for 'a piece of the action' — not to mention\nthe guaranteed return of the capital and interest if no action materialises! (In\nthat sense, we were probably the victims of recent low interest rates, which\nhave forced traditional bankers into a game of Darwinian evolution. If inter-\nest rates won't bring home the bacon, then maybe 'a piece of the action' will.\nBanks, like everyone else, have to evolve or die.)\nThis, of course, is the premise upon which venture capitalists have always\noperated. Venture capital companies are one way to raise capital, for sure.\nBut the price they demand is nearly always that you hand over a huge chunk\nof equity. More often than not, they also insist on a date by which your new\nventure must be sold, either back to yourself or to outsiders.\nWhy? Because their own funds usually come from wealthy individuals\nwho demand a high return within a limited time frame. This, in turn, leads\nmany venture capitalists to move from an advisory to an operational role\nin any business in which they invest, cramping your style and scaring the\npants out of everyone who works for you. Those wealthy investors in their\nown funds are unforgiving and merciless, and venture capitalists will there-\nfore do anything it takes to protect and maximise short-term returns from\nyour business.\n\f\nThey aren't so much sharks as dolphins - a nickname deriving from their\nfrantic desire to 'flip' every deal as quickly as possible. By 'flipping', I mean\na sale. They do not care who the venture is sold to (yourself or an outside\nparty), but the return of their investment, with a massive bonus for the risk\nand skill they have invested, is mandatory.\nVenture capital money, dolphin money, is not for the faint-hearted. Too\noften, it is only for the desperate - unless building a business for a quick(ish)\nreturn and a small piece of the action is your goal. And there is nothing\nwrong with such a goal in the short term.\nIf that is the case, then it's worth remembering that the best of the\ndolphins can certainly boast a ton of managerial talent and experience. They\ntend to know what they are talking about in the abstract, if not in your\nparticular niche. Dolphins can afford to hire such talent for the simple reason\nthat they absolutely have to. Those high-wealth individuals, and institutional\ninvestors who invested with them in the first place, are unforgiving. Your\nsuccessful venture-capital -funded business must also pay for the failures  \nthat\nthe same venture capitalist invested in last year.\nIn the glorious lines of Jonathan Swift:\nSo, naturalists observe, a flea\nHath smaller fleas that on him prey;\nAnd these have smaller fleas to bite 'em,\nAnd so proceed ad infinitum.\nAnd from a later poet, Augustus de Morgan;\nGreat fleas have little fleas upon their backs to bite 'em,\nAnd little fleas have lesser fleas, and so ad infinitum.\nAnd the great fleas themselves, in turn, have greater fleas to go on;\nWhile those again have greater still, and greater still, and so on.\nAd infinitum indeed! Ah, the wonders of capitalism! Adam Smith, you old\nrogue, what have you to say now?\nTime and again I have watched existing companies wishing to expand, or\nnew ventures anxious to get started, mire themselves with the slippery\ndolphins. A few of them succeed, and succeed gloriously, it has to be said.\nBut a great many other original owners or creators are squeezed out long\n\f\nbefore the fabled 'big pay day'.\nIf you tail to grow your businesses swiftly enough, then flipper becomes\nagitated and noses in. His very survival (or at least his annual bonus) depends\nupon your performance that year. Flipper doesn't care about long-term\nprospects. He doesn't even care about long-term shareholder value. He only\ncares about growth - and he cares about it now.\nAs with his co-denizen of the deep, the shark, he either keeps moving\nforward or he drowns - and you have no choice but to move forward or\ndrown with him. Except it will not be his corpse spiralling down into the\ndepths if things go wrong. He will live to fight another day. You, on the\nother hand, will be shark bait.\nVenture capitalist short-termism, with its eye firmly glued to the sale of\nan enterprise within three or four years, is the hallmark of nearly all venture\ncapital activity. As is their insistence on a massive stake, often a controlling\none, in any business they provide capital for. Experience has shown them  \nrhat\nthis control, combined with financial growth at almost any price, is the\ncourse most likely to return the profits they need to satisfy their own\ninvestors: the great fleas on their back.\nBelieve me, they are hard taskmasters. But they may be the only way tor\nyou to get really started. More often, you will start up underfunded, on your\nown or with the fishes (we are coming to that), and only turn to the dolphins\nfor the injection of capital you believe will propel you to the next level. That  \nis\nusually the way of it. You will need a degree of success to exhibit to them. \nAnd\nyou will need to be somewhat humble - except in your financial projections.\nI have been approached by venture capitalists on many occasions. They\nare not evil men and women; far from it. They are mostly smart, well-\nconnected, persuasive and passionate about success. But their first loyalty is\nto the quick buck. You do business with them at your peril. Be warned: with\nthem, you may have a better than even chance of making your first million.\nBut you will make them many, many more millions in order to do so. And\nyou are unlikely to stay in control of your own destiny with any business they\ninvest heavily in.\nShould you decide to approach venture capitalists, and by some miracle\nshould they agree to back you, then I urge you to seek the finest legal advice\nthat your money can buy for the ensuing negotiations. Just one sentence,\n\f\neven a phrase, within the initial contract can make all the difference in the\nworld to the outcome a few years down the road.\nThe dolphins are consummate professionals - to them you are just\nanother amateur in the sea trying to stay afloat, to grow, to make his or her\nfinancial dreams come true. Amateurs are easy meat. (Real-life dolphins, by\nthe way, are not the gentle creatures children believe them to be. They can  \nbe\ndangerous and their beaks are as hard as bone. They can, and do, batter  \nsharks\nto death in massed attacks if they have to. And their appetite is prodigious.)\nHaving avoided the sharks and perhaps swum with the dolphins, we turn\nto the fishes. How I love the fishes! How you will learn to love them, too!\nIt was via the fishes that I made my own first money - the seed capital\nwhich ensured that I retained control and ownership of my own business\nback in the early days of Dennis Publishing. Fishes come in all shapes and\nsizes. Friends, acquaintances, relatives, business colleagues, small investors,\nfriendly bank managers of the old school, professional advisors, ex-employ-\ners, suppliers and vendors are among them. But how can they be of any use?\nLet me illustrate by my own example. In 1972 I persuaded a jolly young\nlawyer I had met to act for me. His name was Bernie Simons. I had no money\nto pay him, but perhaps my chutzpah amused him. He helped me to register\nmy £100 limited-liability company and provided me with at least a figleaf of\nrespectability. I think I paid him £20 for his services. The company was called\nH. Bunch Associates and I intended to publish a series of comic books.\nNext, I persuaded a close friend, Dick Fountain, to join me as co-director\nand production manager. There wasn't much in the way of a salary on offer,\nbut Dick came all the same. We 'liberated' a few sticks of office furniture, two\nelectric typewriters and a floor camera from the offices of OZ magazine\n(where Dick and I had met), which was then in the process of winding up.\nAnother friend, Lemmy, later to become famous with the heavy-metal\nband Motorhead, mentioned that an acquaintance of his was vacating a\ngarret in the West End - perhaps we could move in there? (Lemmy used\noccasionally to sleep under the OZ design table while recovering from exces-\nsive ingestion of alcohol and other substances.)\nLemmy was right about the empty flat. Three rooms at the top of the\nmost rickety stairs I had ever climbed. The building had been badly damaged\nin the Blitz and never properly rebuilt. The last tenants had been breeding\n\f\npuppies there in straw pens. It took a long time to get rid of the stink of\npuppy shit.\nThe place was a total dump, but at least we had an 'office'. I reluctantly\nsold one of the electric typewriters and produced a deposit for the landlord.  \nHe\nwas anxious only that we should never mention we were using the garret as an\n'office'. The local council had designated it as a 'residence'. A 'residence' with\nno kitchen, no bathroom and no ceiling. In one room you could look straight\nthrough the rafters into the gaps between the roof tiles and see the sky.\nNext, a close friend and colleague, Richard Adams, designed some smart\nheaded notepaper for us free of charge, suspecting (rightly) that we might be\nable to provide him with work if our venture succeeded. A small printer I had\ncome to know while working for OZ magazine agreed to print this note-\npaper, knowing full well I could not pay him for it right then.\nA semi-friendly, amused bank manager at Barclays Bank in Tottenham\nCourt Road opened an account for the company, into which I deposited the\nmighty sum of £50. A magazine distributor, Moore-Harness, with whom OZ\nhad done business, agreed to distribute my product, although I had nothing\nto show them. All we needed now was content for our comic, and a printer\nto print it.\nThe content was not a problem. We knew plenty of comic illustrators and\nthey would not expect to be paid in advance. Indeed, some of them would\nnot expect to be paid at all, and were surprised when we eventually managed\nto do so. The printing was the big stumbling block, of course. Somehow, I\nhad to persuade a printer to provide machine time and paper to produce the\ncomic we were busy preparing in the garret. The bill would come to a few\nthousand pounds.\nI had written a great many record reviews when I worked for OZ maga-\nzine. The record companies would send albums directly to my flat in the\nhope of soliciting a review and they never asked for the LPs back. I sorted\nout all the albums I could bear to part with and sold them to a local record\nshop. This brought in just sufficient funds to at least get a few printers to talk\nto me while Dick and I lived on £10 a week. But unless I could guarantee\nthat the printers got paid, not one of them, very sensibly, would budge.\nThen I had an idea. I asked Brian Moore and Charlie Harness, the\nowners of my potential distributors for the comic, to write to a particular\nprinter, promising that he would be the first to receive money from Moore-\nHarness when the comic came out, Brian and Charlie did not guarantee the\n\f\nmoney; they were not exactly idiots. But they made it sound, as a matter of\ncommon sense, that at least enough money was likely to be generated by\nsales of the comic to pay the print and paper bill.\nAnd they stressed that their client, my little company, would only receive\nany residue when and if the printer had been paid in full. This was the key.\nBrian and Charlie turned out to be the most effective fishes in the pond of\nmy ambition.\nBusiness must have been slow, because the printer agreed to Moore-\nHarness's proposal. I secretly suspect that he did so as much to keep me from\nconstantly badgering him as anything else. Persistence is a powerful tool in\nthe hands of a hungry young hustler on the make. And he probably did not\nwish to offend a powerful distributor like Moore-Harness. Distributors\nsometimes have a say in who gets to print what.\nThus it was that the first issue of Cozmic Comics was unleashed upon\nan unsuspecting world. It barely made a cent, but it provided the frame-\nwork for yet more publishing ventures. Within two years I had sixty thou-\nsand pounds in the bank. (That is the equivalent of half a million pounds\ntoday.) The printers were paid. The contributors were paid. The designers\nwere paid. The landlord was paid. Bernie Simons got paid. Even Dick and\nI were paid.\nAbove all, I retained control of the company. A company I still own 1OO\nper cent of thirty years later, I had created capital by swimming with the  \nfishes.\nWithout Dick's expertise, or the kindness of a lawyer, or the trust of\ncontributors and designers, or the amused tolerance of my distributors, or\nany of a hundred other encouragements from those around me, it simply\ncould not have been done. I have read, in articles written about me since in\nnewspapers and magazines, that fierce loyalty to old friends and colleagues is\nmy best characteristic. I believe that to be so. But having read all of the\nabove, can anyone wonder why?\nSome will argue that what I did back in 1972 could not be emulated today.\nBut human nature does not change and, at bottom, we are cooperative\nanimals. Many people are indulgent towards the young - after all, we were all\nonce young ourselves. Those who wish to start a company and get rich  \ncannot\nexpect a free ride. But they might be surprised at the number of fishes in their\nparticular pond willing to help them to some degree or another.\n\f\nAnd look at the consequences in my own case:\nO Moore-Harness continued to distribute my magazines. When Brian and\nCharlie were forced to sell their company years later, I fought hard to\nensure fair treatment for its two founders. By that time, I was in a posi-\ntion to return their original favour.\nO Dick Fountain is still a director of Dennis Publishing and the company\nhas put food on his table for more than thirty years.\nO Our landlord was happy to sell me the building in which our garret was\nlocated decades later when he retired.\nO The printer went on printing for us until the day he sold up. As far as\nDick and I were concerned, we owed him.\nO I continued to bank with Barclays for far longer than I should have done,\nsolely from a sense of misplaced loyalty.\nO Richard Adams still designs projects for me.\nO And guess what? My legal advisors in the UK today are a firm named\nSimons, Muirhead & Burton, founded by none other than one Bernie\nSimons, a young lawyer who helped a kid on the make register his first\ncompany.\nO Lastly, to this day, I always do my best to encourage, or to be of some\npractical help, to others who wish to strike out on their own.\nVenture capitalists, major investors and bankers all have their part to play in\nproviding capital for individuals and start-up companies. But if it is at all\npossible, give me the fish over the sharks and dolphins every time. It may\ntake a mite longer to get there, but you'll be far richer, or at the very least,\nhappier, in the long run.\nOne last word on obtaining capital. It's the worst part of the whole busi-\nness of getting rich. Nothing is more humiliating or debilitating than trudg-\ning the rounds with your hand out, no matter how good your project or\nfierce your determination. Everyone has to do it and everyone hates it. For\na self-made man or woman there is no avoiding it. Beware of anyone who\ntells you that there are short cuts to obtaining even a small amount of capi-\ntal. Outside of family and friends, there are none that I ever heard of.\nLook on the bright side. Those lazy bastards who turn away from this\nodious task are going to be your employees. They are going to make you  \nrich.\n\f\nIn a sense, this exhausting and miserable search is what separates the\nwannabes from the gonnabes. The only way through it is to keep trudging.\n'When going through, hell,' Winston Churchill once remarked, 'keep going.'\nIf you cannot bear the thought of prostrating yourself to obtain the seed\ncorn, then you will almost certainly never own the farm. 'To get what you\nneed / You toady to greed.'\nOr else, you ask; very, very nicely indeed.\n7\nA great calm moon rose back o' the mill,\nAnd I told myself it was God's will\nWho went hungry and who went fed.\nI tried to whistle; I tried to be brave;\nBut the new ploughed fields smelt dank as the grave\nAnd I wished I were dead."

    "raw_text": "NEVER GIVE IN\nNever give in! Never give in! Never, never,\nnever, never - in nothing great or small., large\nor petty. Never give in., except to convictions\nof honour and good sense.\nWINSTON CHURCHILL\nHANDSTANDS ON THE RIM OF HELL\nSome years ago, I bought up part of the library of the novelist J.B. Priestley,\nIn one of his books, Up Hill and Down Dale, by a virtually unknown poet,\nKenneth H. Ashley, published in 1924, I found a slip of paper where\nPriestley had marked a particular poem:\nOut of Work\nAlone at the shut of the day was I,\nWith a star or two in a frost cleared sky,\nAnd the byre smell in the air.\nI'd tramped the length and breadth o' the fen;\nBut never a farmer wanted men;\nNaught doing anywhere.\nI know that feeling, and if you are set on creating your own business from\nscratch, then so will you. Despite all my brave words earlier in the previous\nchapter, I never knew a worse few months than when I was bashing my head\nagainst a brick wall attempting to start my own outfit in the early 1970s. The\nwhole process was pure misery.\nLooking back through the prismed eyes of a champagne flute, I suppose\nI could argue that perhaps it was my finest moment. Not that it felt like it at\nthe time. To be honest, it nearly broke me.\nBut I would not give in.\nThat was the secret ingredient. I would not be a wage slave, I would not\ntake 'no' for an answer. I would not give in. I was going to be rich. Some\nhow. Some way. Some day soon. And I would not retreat to the safety of a\ndecent job until I was starved out of house and home.\n\f\nI would not give in.\nNot that I cared, to be honest I barely noticed, but Britain appeared to\nbe in terminal financial decline at the time. Interest rates had sky-rocketed\nand strikes were so commonplace it was difficult to recall a landscape not\nriven by demonstrations, lockouts and industrial disputes. The banks and the\nmarkets weren't just skittish, they were downright terrified. Property values\neither soared or collapsed. Politicians were jittery. IRA bombs were explod-\ning left, right and centre. The UK had been railroaded into what was then\nthe European Community. They were not good times.\nNo one appeared very interested in loaning money to an unemployed,\nlong-haired south London lad who called himself a publisher. And frankly,\nwho could blame them?\nWhat fuelled me was the desperation of knowing that unless I found a\nway round my lack of capital, unless I could pour my energy into a venture\nof my own, I would be condemned to a life of wage slavery. There is\nabsolutely nothing more likely to dampen the prospects of becoming rich\nthan a nice, fat, regular salary cheque.\nMany of my friends were in the same boat, and not a few of them were\nbetter educated and smarter than I was. The cleverest of them had chosen\ncareers in advertising agencies or with record companies or in television\nor radio.\nIt was depressing meeting with them, listening to stories of their latest\npromotion, never able to buy a round in the pub as they were so generously\nwilling and able to do. Month after month I soldiered on, while 'the new\nploughed fields smelt dank as the grave; and I wished I were dead'.\nBut I would not give in.\nI had had offers. One or two of them decent offers. There were people who\nbelieved I could make them money. And I could have done. It was tempting.\nMy years working at OZ magazine had served as a fine apprenticeship (an\napprenticeship I shall always be grateful for) and, as a result, I had met many\npeople in the arts, the media and in politics. In addition, the owner of OZ,\nRichard Neville, had once asked me to spend a few weeks at a poster  \ncompany\nwith the bizarre name of ECAL, which stood for Effective Communications\nArts Limited. ECAL owed OZ money for advertising. Rather a lot of  \nmoney.\nIt was my job to get it back.\n\f\nI had arrived at ECAL's Covent Garden offices one fine summer morn-\ning. It was a shambles. They had a fantastic stock of posters in the basement,\nbut there were far too many layabouts on the payroll and precious little in\nthe way of organisation or sales and accounts staff. I astonished those pres-\nent by firing one or two people.\nThis was unspeakable. Hippies did not 'fire' each other. I was hauled in\nfront of one of the directors, Bill Butler. What nobody knew was that Barry\nMiles and Bill Butler, two of the founders of ECAL, had already agreed to\nme running their ship for a while. They were growing as tired of unpaid  \nbills\nas their customers and vendors were. The firings stood.\nI was ostracised. Which worried me not a whit. For a few weeks I hurled\nmyself into the business. I was abrupt, obnoxious, full of myself and spec-\ntacularly successful. When I discovered a particular poster was selling like  \nhot\ncakes (Frank Zappa sitting on the loo), I ordered more. We would have to\nwait, I was told. The printer was busy. So I printed it on crappy paper at\nanother printer. Who cared? They still sold.\nMore horror from staffers. ECAL was an art business, I was primly\ninformed. No it wasn't. It was a basement with a lot of idle tossers in it\nscrounging a living.\nThe net result of my work in the basement at Covent Garden was that\nOZ got repaid and ECAL became more profitable. For a while, anyway.  \nBut\nthey soon slipped back into their comfortable ways and shut up shop.\nSo I knew I could run a business. I knew I could turn one around, if I\nhad to. What I didn't know was how the hell I was going to find the\nmoney to get started. In fact all I knew was - you guessed it - I would not\ngive in.\nI remember a bitter winter night in my West End flat at the back of a\nSavile Row sweat shop. Edward Heath's three-day week was in operation,  \nor\nat least a precursor to it, and some daft minister had suggested that the citi-\nzens of the UK should learn 'to shave in the dark' to save electricity. That\nwas nothing new to me. The electricity had been turned off in my flat weeks\nago. So had the gas. I couldn't afford to pay the bill.\nI sat by an open fire, feeding broken furniture I had scavenged from a\n\f\nskip into my living-room fireplace, watching scorched veneer bubble and\npeel from the sawn-off leg of a chair. My girlfriend sat beside me on a\nbattered old beanbag. The food we had just cooked had been bought by her.\nSo had the cigarettes we were smoking. She worked in a boutique round the\ncorner in Carnaby Street.\nSoftly, cautiously, insistently, she set out to persuade me to take the job\nI had been offered as a result of yet another attempt to raise money. She\nreminded me that at twenty-five years old, I was still a young man. That I\ncould always give up the job and then start my own company later. That this\nwas not the time. That she hated to see me so bad tempered, doing little but\nmaking plans and spinning wheels in a hopeless quest to raise capital to start\nmy own business.\nI nearly cracked. I loved her as only the young can love, and I knew I\nwould lose her if I refused. Not that she ever said as much, she wasn't a\ngreedy or a cruel lass, but even so, I knew. Perhaps she was right. Maybe I\nshould take the job and try to launch my own company in a year or so's time.\nWhy not, if it would make her happy? It was only a job, after all. Not like\njoining the army - I could always leave in a few weeks - or months - or  \nyears.\nIf I had promised her then, sitting by that fire, promised that I would\n'earn a crust like a normal human being', then my life would have taken a\ndifferent course, I think. Yet, like the poet Robert Frost: 'Knowing how way\nleads on to way / I doubted that I should ever come back.' There was the\nrub. It was now or it was never.\nHow close did I come? Did I open my mouth to speak? Memory plays\ntricks when you're older, and I cannot be sure. I am sure of one thing,\nthough. That promise never came out of my mouth.\nI did not give in.\nThen the phone rang. (I would have walked naked in the street before I\nallowed them to cut off my phone.) It was a pal of mine; somebody I was\nlater to employ for many years. He had some good news.\nHe had bought a second-hand car with his salary from his advertising\nsales job and was parked downstairs by the telephone box. I let him up and\nhe produced some bottles of beer and a spliff. He drove my girlfriend home\nlater. You can guess the rest. Money talks. Bullshit walks.\nThe next day, I went straight back to knocking on doors and punishing\nthe phone, pestering people for capital. Learning how to swim with the"

    "raw_text": "fishes. No way was I going to spend my life making other people rich. No\nway was I going to become a token hippy in some record company. No way\nwas I going to do any damn thing except get on the merry-go-round of\nmaking dosh. Real dosh. My dosh.\nI would not give in.\nThat is what it is like in the beginning. Always. It is desperate and it is\nhumiliating. As you will find, in your own way, unless you were born with a\nrich mummy or daddy or uncle. For the rest of us, if you want to be rich,\nthen you must walk a narrow, lonely road to get the capital to make it so.\nOff in the wings, there are always the gentle, siren voices of friends,\nparents and employers, of reasonable and sensible people, torn between\nconcern for your welfare and the secret fear that you might succeed. A harsh\nreading of such concerns, I admit. But a true one.\nIf you happen to read biographies, as I do (scores of them every year),\nyou will find a thread that runs through almost any story of success against\nthe odds. Whether money comes into it or not. Whether the person\nsucceeded or failed. Or even, most sadly of all, when they did succeed, but\ndid not live long enough to learn of their success.\nIn one of the finest such books in the world. Letters to My Brother by the\nartist Vincent van Gogh, collected and published long after his death, you\nwill find unbearable heartbreak, madness, rejection, hunger, passion, night-\nmare terrors and a tale of a man who never gave in. Who would not give in,\nthough it cost him his life.\nVan Gogh's obsessions and talents drove him mad. And he knew it. They\ngoaded and scourged him. He said himself that he had given his life and half\nhis sanity to his art. There was only one shining star of kindliness in his\nuniverse. His brother, Theo.\nTheo, despite the sensible entreaties of his sensible wife (who could\nscarcely abide, let alone understand, her husband's wastrel brother), kept\nsending what little he could afford for Vincent to purchase brushes, canvas\nand paint. These acts of charity, which Theo could not easily afford and\nwhich grieved Vincent to receive, changed the course of the history of art.\nBecause Vincent often had no money. None at all. He would sell his\npaintings to peasants or inn-keepers in exchange for food and board.\nCanvases that would later sell for tens of millions of dollars were exchanged\nfor a roof in a barn and a breakfast or lunch. (I wonder if any of those\ncanvases are still lying, undiscovered, in a dusty old Dutch attic?)\n\f\nHis clothes were worn out. He wandered the countryside like a tramp.\nHe knew himself to be a disappointment to his family and to those few\nfriends who remembered his existence. He had been a disappointment to the\nonly woman he ever lived with. He was certainly a disappointment to\nhimself. Nothing went right, except, very occasionally, a particular painting.\nAbove all, it grieved him to be a burden to his brother.\nBut he would not give in.\nHe would die first. He would kill himself first. And that's what he did.\nTo our eternal shame, he did just that. And he died having written: 'I cannot\nhelp it that my pictures do not sell. Nevertheless, the time will come when\npeople will see that they are worth more than the price of the paint.'\nAye, they were, Vincent. They were worth more than that,\nGo buy yourself a copy of Vincent's letters. If his paintings had been\njudged to be daubs fit only to kindle a fire, his letters would still shine like\ndiamonds in the mud of everyday life. Go buy a copy, and when the going\ngets rough, my friend, or appears to be rough to you at the time, think of\nVincent van Gogh, tramping his way across a nightmare landscape of destitu-\ntion and rejection for what he believed in. A man who believed he had  \nfailed.\nBut a man who never gave in.\nYou must choose. Life is comfortable enough in the Western world for\nmost people. In most parts of Europe there are the safety nets of the social\nservices and of government-subsidised medical care. There are decent jobs at\ndecent salaries with decent colleagues and a decent retirement; and all with-\nout the heart-stopping fear of bankruptcy, of years of risk amid fears of igno-\nminious failure.\nWhy make handstands on the rim of hell? Why bother to punish yourself\nin such a way? Nobody else does it - why should you? Go on, make every-\none around you happy.\nWhy not give in?\nIf you are merely a wannabe, then the siren voices will prevail, and they\nwill be right to prevail. If you are a gonnabe, then they will not prevail. Like\nOdysseus you will stop your ears with wax or bind yourself to the mast. You\nwill learn to walk your narrow, lonely road - and to hell with the siren voices.\nYou will not give in."

KARL POPPER, CONJECTURES  AND REFUTATIONS\nTHE FIRST ERROR:\nMISTAKING DESIRE FOR COMPULSION\nAll error springs from flawed assumptions. If there are no assumptions, there\ncan be no error.\nI am told that during the Vietnam War, a sign was kept nailed on a wall\nabove a particular marine commander's desk which said: 'Assumption is the\nmother of all f***-ups'. Those seven words should be carved into the heart\nof every entrepreneur, the wealthy or the annabe, the gonnabe or the been-\nthere-done-that. A shame they weren't nailed above the desk of the president\nof the United States at the time.\nAs far as getting rich is concerned, the cardinal error is to begin such a\nquest in the vague belief that you would like to be rich. Wishing or desiring\nto be rich is perhaps the most commonplace of human desires, other than\nsexual fantasy. Yet few people ever succeed in achieving it.\nSuch desire is a fleeting thing, a will-of-the-wisp floating across the\nsurface of the mind as you pass the front window of a chic boutique: 'I wish\nI was rich. If only I could afford it, I would march straight inside and buy\nthat beautiful handbag.' Then the No. 43 bus comes along, and all such\nthoughts arc abandoned on the pavement.\nWishes are fishes that swim in the nets\nOf castaways' souls by the shores of the dead.\nWhere coins are as rare as a ferryman's debts,\nAnd nobody cares what you did, or you said.\nWishes come skipping and eager to play"

    "raw_text": "In the ravenous dreams of childless wives;\nWishes are thoroughbreds feasting on hay\nWhile rickety mendicants limp all their lives.\nWishing for or desiring something is futile without an inner compulsion to\nachieve it. Such lack of compulsion, if not frankly acknowledged, can lead to\ngreat personal unhappiness. We have all met deeply unhappy souls muddling\nalong in professions or careers for which they are patently unsuited.\nWorse still, by continually wishing and never delivering, you risk denting\nyour confidence, beginning a vicious downward spiral that appears to draw\nmisfortune like a magnet. The assumption that you might be able to achieve\nsome goal if you only wish hard enough is not just a f***-up. It's a poten-\ntial personal tragedy.\nLife is not some kind of rehearsal. Why, then, do so many people punish\nthemselves in this way? The answer, in almost every case, is that they were\n'persuaded' or hectored into becoming a banker or a lawyer when, in reality,\nthey would have preferred to do something else entirely. Their misery is\nmade all the worse by the realisation that had they acknowledged their lack\nof enthusiasm early on and stuck to their guns, their lives might well have\ntaken a far more congenial course.\nIt is my hope that this book will cause you to consider very carefully\nwhether you are truly driven by inner demons to be rich. If you are not, then\nmy earnest and heartfelt advice to you is: do not on any account make the\nattempt. What are riches anyway, compared to health or the peace of mind\nthat even a modicum of contentment brings in its wake? In and of itself,\ngreat wealth very rarely, if ever, breeds contentment.\nBelieve me, I know. I am both an entrepreneur and a poet. Perhaps it is\nthe poet typing these words now and not the entrepreneur. But no conde-\nscension is intended whatever when I ask you to quietly turn over in your\nmind whether or not you are fit to be rich. Whether the sacrifices involved -\nnot only your own, but those you will ask of your family, present or future —\nare worth the tyranny that such ambition, by its very nature, exacts.\nNever yet have I met a self-made rich man or woman whose family or\npersonal relationships were not plagued by the burden of creating a fortune,\neven a small fortune. A rocky marriage; lack of time spent with their  \nchildren;\nthe substitution of expensive gifts to repress guilt created by their frequent\nabsences from home; the concern that their children have grown used to\n\f\nprivilege and are consequently slacking in their education or lacking in ambi-\ntion - all of these come as part and parcel of self-made wealth.\nThere is no escape, although each of us believes we can be the exception\nthat proves the rule. Is this a price you are prepared to pay?\nAnd there is worse yet. Such an attempt, without the conviction to\nsustain it, can bring the worst of all worlds, for if a person does achieve\nwealth, at great personal sacrifice, they will have at least acquired a vast\nfortune in assets or in cash. But to make the attempt without sufficient\npassion and commitment, knowing in your heart of hearts that you lack the\nconviction to succeed, risks the suffering of a self-inflicted plague without\neven the consolations the loot may bring.\nDo not mistake desire for compulsion. Only you can know the song of\nyour inner demons. Only yon can know if you are willing to tread the\nnarrow, lonely road to riches. No one else can know. No one else can tell  \nyou\neither to do it or to refrain from the attempt. When the going gets tough,\nwhen all seems lost, when partners and luck desert you, when bankruptcy\nand failure are staring you in the face, all that can sustain you is a fierce\ncompulsion to succeed at any price.\nSomewhere in the invisible heart of all self-made wealthy men and\nwomen is a sliver of razored ice. The love of another, or of family (or of  \ntheir\nGod, if they have one), can help to contain it. Seeking great wealth will\nrelease that sliver to grow. It is in the nature of the beast. If you do not wish\nit to grow, then quit any dreams of becoming wealthy now.\nThis all sounds rather melodramatic. But then I have an advantage. Not\nonly have I grown that sliver myself, to kill my enemies with, to slay  \ndemons\nin the night and to harden myself against the losses to others my victories\nhave engendered - not only that - but I have watched it grow in others who\nbecame wealthy. It is always there and will swell into a protective carapace as\nyou search to grow rich.\n'Better to have tried and failed than not to have tried at all,' drones the\nold saw. But in this instance, the cliche is wrong, utterly wrong.\nBetter to have chosen a different life, a quite different path, than have\nplaced yourself and those you love in harm's way when early reflection and\nthought could have advised you differently. I repeat: do not mistake desire"

    "raw_text": "for compulsion. Those that do nearly always fail, at great cost to themselves\nand those around them.\nTHE SECOND ERROR:\nOVEROPTIMISM CONCERNING CASH FLOW\nAny trained accountant or auditor reading this book has just nodded their\nhead. The last four words of the subheading above are the source of the vast\nmajority of business failures. But why should they concern somebody who is\ndetermined to get rich? Isn't cash flow a bean-counter topic? The concern of\naccountants?\nThe answer is that not only does lack of cash. How eventually doom any\nenterprise, it just as surely prises control of any entity from its owner or\nmajority shareholder. And it is control and ownership of a business entity\nwhich brings with it the promise of future wealth.\nLose control of a business by running out of cash and you are relegated to\nthe status of minority investor or salaried employee. Once you lose control  \nof\na business, then no bank, white knight, investor or new owner is likely to \npermit\nyou to gain control again, if for no other reason than that of your original sin,\nyour overoptimism concerning the venture's cash flow in the first place.\nAll new ventures (and established ones, too, come to that) require posi-\ntive cash flow if they are to grow and to succeed. This is an elementary  \npoint,\nwhich would scarcely need reiterating if it were not for the number of times\nI have seen a promising venture snatched away from its founder when cash\nSow faltered.\nCash is a serious matter. Its management is utterly vital in any enterprise.\nIf, like me, you have no head for figures whatever, then this is no cause for\nconcern. You simply employ somebody who does and listen to them care-\nfully. Lord knows, there are enough qualified bean-counters in the world and\nforecasting cash flow is hardly rocket science.\nIt was only when a venture I was involved in became a publicly listed\ncompany that I bothered to ask a senior accountant to explain to me what a\nbalance sheet really was. He was astonished. How could I have become a \nmulti-\nmillionaire many times over without truly understanding a balance sheet?\nIn point of fact, he did not believe it possible at first. I explained to him\n\f\nthat I had always left all that stuff to my finance directors and accountants -\nI was too busy making (and spending!) money, and had always begrudged\nthe time it might take to grasp the finer points of formally recording its\nmovement or current resting place.\nToday, I have at least a rudimentary understanding of depreciation and\nsuchlike on a balance sheet. But as far as cash flow is concerned, I have little\nto learn from any qualified accountant. Cash flow is something that any\nentrepreneur must fully comprehend from the get-go. Balance sheets are a\nmatter for accountants, banks and auditors. But cash flow is the heartbeat of\nyour company.\nIf cash flow is good, then no matter how badly run or poorly managed\na company is, there is always a decent chance of turning its fortunes around.\nAt the very least, there is time enough to be able to do so. But if a busi-\nness's cash flow is weak or failing, then the chances are that it must shut\ndown or be sold in the not-too-distant future and its assets disposed of to\nsatisfy creditors.\nWhy is it that cash flow is so often the cause of business failure? Most\noften, either the business is not a viable one, or it has expanded beyond its\ncapacity to support its rate of expansion.\nUndercapitalisation is a frequent culprit. So is the 'ostrich syndrome',\nwhere inexperienced managers or owners focus only on new business  \ncoming\nin the door while neglecting to attend to mundane tasks like meeting  \npayroll,\n\f\nrent and tax demands. Or, and this is far worse, and more common, they\nhave refused to listen to whoever is in charge of cash flow. Perhaps  \ncustomers\nare refusing to pay? Perhaps bad debt has crept up to unacceptable levels?\nPerhaps there are no customers left except for the new ones?\nLike Dickens's Mr Micawber, instead of doing something to stem the\ntide, such owners are always certain that 'something will turn up'. So it does,\noften in the form of a writ for bankruptcy or a bailiff's court order.\nIn the early days of my first UK company, desperately undercapitalised\nand without the funds to grow as quickly as I wished, I realised to my horror\nthat I would run out of cash in a few weeks unless I acted. I went to see a\nfriend who owned his own small company, who must remain nameless here.\nHe, too, was concerned about his cash flow. Both of us had already turned\nto our respective banks for an overdraft, but our companies were too young\nto elicit any such benevolence.\nBetween us we hatched a plot. (I can think of no other word for what we\ndid.) I invoiced my friend's company and he invoiced mine, not just once,\nbut several times over the course of the next few months. Each paid the other\nusing a company cheque. In Britain, unlike in America, it is not a federal\noffence to issue a cheque without the funds in your account at that time to\ncover payment, providing you intend to pay. Turnover at both our little\ncompanies increased substantially. We timed our payments precisely, so that\nour accounts were just in funds to meet each other's demands. This meant\nwe both had to pay special attention to our respective cash flows.\nI went back to the bank. They were delighted that business was boom-\ning. They were even more delighted that I was monitoring my cash flow so\nadroitly. My friend did the same. Eventually, both banks issued each of our\ncompanies an overdraft facility. That facility permitted me to grow at a  \nmuch\nfaster rate than I could have done otherwise, and eventually produced the\nprofits necessary to grow further and to pay off the overdraft,\nI have no idea if what my friend and I did was illegal, though I doubt it\nwas. Without question it was not very ethical, although it certainly proved\neffective. What I am sure of is that the bank appeared more impressed with\nmy ability to control cash flow than they were with my company's 'growth'.\nThat keen-eyed control was the key to unlocking yet more capital, via an\noverdraft with which to expand. It bred confidence.\nAnd now we come to a difficult topic. Factoring debt. I feel like a\n\f\nhypocrite as I type this. But then, I have been called worse things in my life\nand I have broad shoulders. Factoring debt is like smoking cigarettes. You\nknow perfectly well that smoking leads to death - but that death, however\nappalling, is some way off. And you need a cigarette now!\nWhen you do business with a company that factors debt, you make over\nyour debts to them. They charge a fee and percentage of the debt. A swinge-\ning percentage. Bingo! You have solved your cash-flow crisis.\nExcept you haven't. Not in the long run. Factoring is a deal with the\ndevil, and just like Faust, you will have the worst of the bargain. You should\nonly factor in absolute extremity. You should be careful in your deal to\nensure you can release your company from the factoring contract without\nforking out a massive penalty. Ideally, you should never do it at all. And  \nthat's\nall I have to say about smoking cigarettes or factoring. Both deeply unpleas-\nant, unhealthy and pernicious activities.\nFacing up to cash-flow demands and refusing to succumb to the 'ostrich\nsyndrome' is a paramount concern in any start-up. You can delegate many\ntasks when creating a new business, but monitoring and forecasting cash  \nflow\nis not one of them. It's your responsibility and your task. Nobody else's.\nYou can improve cash flow by observing the following suggestions in a\nstart-up's early days:\nO  Keep payroll down to an absolute minimum. Overhead walks on two  \nlegs.\nO Never sign long-term rent agreements or take upmarket office space.\nQ Never indulge in fancy office or reception furniture, unless your particu-\nlar business demands that you make such an impression on clients.\nO Never buy a business meal if the other side offers to. You can show off\nlater.\nQ Pay yourself just enough to eat.\nQ Do not be shy to call customers who owe you money personally. It works.\nO In a city, walk everywhere you can. It's healthy and sets a good example.\nO Check all staff travel and entertainment claims with an eagle eye."

I hated every minute of\ndoing it in those early days, but if a bean-counting klutz like me could do it,\nthen you can too.\nTHE THIRD ERROR: REINFORCING FAILURE\nProbably the two easiest words to write and the hardest error to avoid in this\nentire book. We all do it. Even the best of us. And we never stop doing it all\nour business lives. This is a disease curable only by iron willpower or 20/20\nhindsight.\nReinforcing failure sounds so easy to avoid. If something fails, stop doing\nit and start doing something else, right? Er, right. Except, just when do you\ndecide that you have a 'failure' on your hands? Too late, is the answer -\nalways too late.\nLet's examine the nature of success and failure for a moment. We know\nthat success has a thousand fathers while failure is famously always an orphan.\nNot to mention a bastard. Then again, success has been described as the abil-\nity to go from one failure to another, unrepentant and with no loss of enthu-\nsiasm. All very well. But how the devil can we judge when a failure has\n\f\noccurred so that we can safely cease to reinforce it and move on.\nOn this matter, all prophets, wits and gurus are silent. My own suspicion\nis that many failures are merely a matter of timing. What used to fail now\nsucceeds. What once was a sure thing now no longer works.\nTake the invention of the fax. Fax technology existed for decades before\nfax machines were universally adopted. One day my office manager in the US\nwalked me out in the hall to show me how to use our shiny new fax machine.\n'Why do we need one?'\n'Because everyone is getting one.'\n'OK, but why is everyone getting one? 1\n'I don't know. They just are.'\nAs far as I could see, the technology had not improved much from the\nprototype I'd inspected a few years back. But now 'everyone' was getting one.\nFailure had transmogrified into success. The fax had reached critical mass.\nTake another example. In 1977 (after years of arm wrestling with the\npowers that be), Sir Freddie Laker launched his transatlantic Skytrain serv-\nice, an airline offering a no-frills service at about one third of the prices of\nhis competitors - notably British Airways. It was a huge success for a while,\nthen failed, collapsing into bankruptcy in 1982 with debts of over £2 50\nmillion. Conventional wisdom in the City and on Wall Street labelled cheap\nairlines a flop.\nAll of a sudden, here in the first decade of the 21st century, bingo! Cheap\nairlines are all the rage again and turning over billions of dollars of business\naround the globe. A failure one minute, a success the next. It was just a ques-\ntion of timing.\nWhat has all this to do with reinforcing failure? It is this possibility, the\nchance that we are onto a slow-burn winner, rather than being stuck with an\nout-and-out loser, that persuades so many of us (who should know better) to\nhang in there with a product or service in financial trouble.\nNow settle down, children, and I'll tell you a real sob story. Ten years or\nso ago, I invested heavily in a new project, an interactive CD-ROM disc\ncalled Blender, based in New York City. Blender contained interactive \nreviews\nof new movies and albums, electronic games, animated cartoons, video inter-\nviews with celebrities and a host of other features. You stuck it in your"

    "raw_text": "computer to play it. Or view it. Or watch it. Or listen to it.\nIt was a pioneering project that made a huge splash in the media world.\nThe idea was to publish this CD-ROM every month, just like a magazine.\nWe had a great marketing line for it, too. 'Stay Cool: Stick Your Head in\na Blender'.\nI loved it. So did the rest of the media. We won a zillion awards. The\ndesigners and editors were feted and rivals began to prowl around the corri-\ndors wondering if Blender meant the death of ink-on-paper magazines. They\nneedn't have worried,\nBlender wouldn't sell. Whenever we took it to focus groups or gave it\naway, kids and techies alike whooped and hollered and told us it was 'so\ncool'. I upped the ante. We began advertising it and marketing it. We paid\nstores to carry it. We worked days and we worked nights. Sometimes I had\nto order the young men and women working on Blender to go home to bed,\nthey were having so much fun.\nIn our heart of hearts, we believed we were inventing a new media. We\nmade plans for specialist Blenders, just like you have specialist magazines:\nBlender for cars; Blender for fashion; Blender for new movie releases. My tiny\ncompany was on fire with ideas.\nSome pop stars were so keen on Blender they let us have unreleased music\nvideos and tracks from their forthcoming albums to include on our CD-\nROM\nthat month. The publishing trade press wrote nice things. I took the concept\nback to Britain and tried it there, too. Distributors, retailers, publishing rivals\n- everyone was supportive and applauded this new concept. Everyone except\nthe bloody customers, that is. And every issue sold worse than the last.\nA very great retailer once said: 'There is no victory over customers.' Oh\nboy, did he get that right. But I was convinced that if only people would\nsample Blender they would become addicted. Who was I kidding?\nDid I quit at $1 million loss? No. Did I quit at $3 million loss? No. Only\nwhen I had lost over $5 million did I come to my senses. Five million dollars\nwas a lot of chump change for an individual entrepreneur back in the 1990s.\nCome to think of it, it still is. Blender wasn't even a part of my core publish-\ning business. That meant I was investing money personally. My five million\nhad come from after-tax dollars! Just how dumb can one guy be? I had\nforgotten John Dryden's advice.\nErrors, like straws, upon the surface flow;\n\f\nHe who would search for pearls must dive below.\nJOHN DRYDEN-, ALL FOR LOVE Or. THE WORLD WELL LOST\nI had forgotten to 'dive below'. I was in awe at the pretty patterns the straw\nmade on the surface. And because I would not give in, my stubbornness\nturned into a jujitsu master and slammed me to the mat again and again.\nWhy did I continue to reinforce failure, week after week, month after\nmonth, year after year? It's a question I have often asked myself - with no\nsatisfactory answer. The best I can give you is that I came to believe too\nmuch in the concept of a regularly published CD-ROM disc and was\nseduced by the technology. In addition, the Blender staff, headed by David\nCherry and Jason Pearson, were a great group of people, hard working,\ntalented, innovative, and fun to be around.\nIn short, I fell in love with the project. I did not listen to my financial\nadvisors or my long-time partners in other companies. I just stuck in there\nand got myself killed for my pains. Nobody would have thought any the less\nof Blender (or my company) if I had pulled the plug at $2 million of loss  \nafter\na couple of years. That would make sense.\nSo right now, with the interest that would have accrued in eight years, I\ncould have four million extra dollars sitting around in a bank account.\nFour million dollars. Think about it. That's the price of reinforcing fail-\nure. Good luck in your own attempts at avoiding it. It's obvious that I don't\nknow how to!\n(NB: One good thing came out of Blender. I had registered the name\nand trademark worldwide in my enthusiasm, an expensive undertaking.\nWhen we launched a music magazine a few years later in America, I called it\nBlender and re-registered it - a far less expensive procedure. Today,  \nBlender\nis a success, the only music magazine to come anywhere close to giving the\nvenerable Rolling Stone a run for its money. It would be nice to have an extra\n$4 million to promote it though!)\nTHE FOURTH ERROR: THINKING SMALL AND ACTING BIG\nHere comes the painful bit. The bit I really do not want to write. The bit\nthat will exhibit yours truly in the worst possible light."

    "raw_text": "All well, dear reader, you have paid money for this book and you deserve\nthe straight goods. I will comfort myself while composing it (though it's not\nmuch comfort, to be honest) with the knowledge that my behaviour was far\nfrom unique. Others were there long before me and many are in training\nright now to take my place in the endless queue of idiots who succumb each\nyear. At least I made it out alive.\nIndeed, for a while, I got it the right way round. But then the thinking-\nsmall-and-acting-big syndrome kicked in and I nearly lost it all - and not just\nthe money. What a cock-up I made of it. But let's start at the beginning.\nWhen I had my first real financial success in 1974 publishing Kung-Fu\nMonthly, a one-shot poster-magazine about the martial-artist film star Bruce\nLee, I had already begun thinking big. There's nothing wrong with think-\ning big.\nThe fact that this teeny-weeny one-shot had Monthly in the title caused\na certain amount of mirth in the British magazine business. One-shots are\nnot unknown by any means, but calling them monthlies is coming it a trifle\nhigh. Anyway, just how much could hippy journalists who knew nothing\nabout kung-fu publish about one man twelve times a year? Even my friendly\ndistributors only gave KFM a year before it folded.\nTo everyone's surprise, not least my own, KFM continued to be\npublished for ten years, and each issue was dedicated almost exclusively to\nextolling the virtues of Bruce Lee. It has to be said that we had one or two\nthings in our favour.\nFirstly, Bruce Lee had lived fast and died young, always a great career\nmove for any movie star. Secondly, it is impossible to libel a dead man,  \nlegally\nspeaking. Thirdly, he was popular in virtually every country in the world,\nincluding the Third World. Fourthly, I had obtained a huge stash of Bruce\nLee photographs by sending my friend, Don Atyeo, to Hong Kong at the\ntime of Bruce Lee's funeral. Don is a great journalist. He set about inter-\nviewing everyone who had ever known Bruce Lee. Those interviews served\nas the basis for my magazine for more than a decade.\nHow else was I thinking big? As soon as Kung-Fu Monthly No. 1 was\npublished (it sold over 100,000 copies right off the bat), I got on aeroplanes.\nDozens of aeroplanes. In country after country after country, together with\nan Australian lawyer friend, Andrew Fisher, I licensed Kung-Fu Monthly to\nnumerous foreign publishing companies. Eventually, there was even a\n\f\nChinese edition of Kung-fu Monthly, along with German, French, Italian,\nSwedish, Dutch, Spanish and Arabic editions.\nThen I flew to America. Economy class. I will never forget the two weeks\nI spent trudging the streets of the Big Apple looking for a partner to publish\nKung-Fu Monthly in the States. My hair was still hallway down my back. My\nhigh-heeled snakeskin boots, Mr Fish tie and Tommy Nutter knock-off suit\nwere not exactly what American businessmen were used to.\nOne of my heroes was Stan Lee and his Marvel comic empire, which\npublished The Incredible Hulk, Spiderman and my personal favourite The \nSilver\nSurfer. To cut a painful ten minutes short, Mr Lee had me tossed out of their\nMidtown offices. One publisher after another took one look at me and my \npuny\nlittle product and showed me the door. Nobody was even remotely  \ninterested.\nIn desperation I went to visit a British ex-pat whose name had been given\nto me by my friend Tony Elliott of Time Out magazine in London. His name\nwas Peter. Together with his partner, Bob, Peter was just starting up his own\nmagazine company in New York City. His office was shared, more of a cubi-\ncle really, but respectable. His demeanour inscrutable. But he had two things\ngoing for him - he had capital and he had the contacts to make publishing\nKFM possible over there.\nSlowly and methodically Peter examined my sample issues of Kung-Fu\nMonthly and began asking me questions relating to costs, sales -and the\nunusual format of a poster-magazine. 'Let me get this straight,' he said. This\nthing is really an uncut sixteen-page signature from a normal magazine and\nyet you charge the price of a whole magazines to the reader.'\n'You've got it,' I replied. 'You can charge that kind of money,' I went on\nbreathlessly, 'because when they finish reading it, kids can hang it on the wall\nas a cheap poster.'\nPeter looked up at me and smiled. 'I'll try it. I have to try it. What can\nwe lose?' Peter and Robert are still my American partners thirty years later.\nKFM was a success in America. And one magazine led to another. Over the\nyears, Peter, Bob and I have risked hundreds of millions of dollars together.\nWe have created jobs for thousands of Americans. We have become rich.\nThinking big. That's the secret. Of the dozens of independent magazine\npublishers in Britain back in the 1970s, hardly one of them dared to think\n\f\nbig enough to get on an aeroplane and hawk their wares in the biggest\nmarket in the world. Those few that did so, licensed their magazines in\nAmerica. They never thought to create a partnership and risk their own capi-\ntal. Not even the largest British magazine publishers, conglomerates like IPC\nthought to risk it. Perhaps they had too much to lose?\nBut the corollary of thinking big is to act small. Just because you have a\nsuccess or two under your belt doesn't mean you have it made. 'Success is\nnever permanent; failure is never fatal. The only thing that really counts is to\nnever, never, never give up.' That's that old windbag Winston Churchill\nagain. But he was bang on the money there.\nOnce you begin to believe that you are infallible, that success will auto-\nmatically lead to more success, and that you have 'got it made', reality will be\nsure to give you a rude wake-up call. Believing your own bullshit is always a\nperilous activity, but never more fatal than for the owner of a start-up  \nventure.\nBy acting small, I mean remaining in touch. Remaining flexible.\nConstantly examining how your company could do better. Keeping a sense\nof proportion and humility. Not throwing your weight around playing the\ngreat 'I Am'. Remembering that much of your success so far has been\nachieved by dumb luck.\nActing small in the early days of your business sets an example to those\naround you. If staff see you indulging in long lunch hours and purchasing\nyourself a fancy company car, then they are either going to resent it or they\nare going to emulate you. This is not a good thing. You can do all that stuff\nlater, when you've made your first fifty million.\nMost of the worst errors I have made in my life came from forgetting to\nact small. It's hard to do when you're rolling around in coin and everything\nis going your way. But acting big leads to complacency, and complacency is\nthe reason that many successful start-ups falter.\nEvery day you have to hit the ground running, putting in more hours\nthan even your most dedicated member of staff. You have to stay flexible.  \nYou\nhave to be willing to listen and to learn and to emulate success elsewhere.  \nIf\nyou don't, if you think you have already made the cut, if you're thinking\n'game over: time to party', then bad stuff begins to happen very quickly.\nI know all this because in the late 1980s and early 1990s I forgot to\n\f\nremember to act small. I spent millions of dollars on drinking, taking drugs\nand running around with whores. I lost all respect for money and for the\nblood, sweat and treasure I had expended to acquire it. I was acting big.\nIn a single decade I got through more than a hundred million dollars\nliving high on the hog. At one time, there were no less than fourteen\n'mistresses' depending on a regular stipend from my personal bank account.\nA single evening's entertainment could come to thirty or forty thousand in\nthe Big Apple, London or Hong Kong. There was nothing I could not do -\nI was king of the world. Acting big.\nEven though I was not so foolish as to use company money for this\nidiocy, my business still suffered and my health suffered. Some good  \npeople\nI trusted stopped working with me. It was absolutely the stupidest thing I\nhave ever done. And it very nearly killed me.\nEventually, I was hospitalised. When the doctors there heard how much\ncocaine and booze I had been imbibing over the past few years, they went\nballistic. In brutal words of one syllable at a time, they warned me that  \neither\nI was through with drugs and booze or they were through with me. One of\nthem, a young doctor with a stutter, summed it all up: 'M-M-Mr Dennis,\nyou are ac-ac-acting as if you ha-ha-have a one-way ticket to ga-ga-gaol or\nthe mo-mor-morgue. Wh-wh-which do you wa-wa-want it to be?'\nHe'd got that right. Acting big.\nEventually I wised up and began to straighten out my life. I escaped by\nthe skin of my teeth from the consequences of acting big. Almost as if by\nmagic, the business began to make progress again. I hurled myself back into\nthe fray, gave up all narcotics (probably the hardest thing I have ever done),\nstuck to wine as far as the booze went and told the whores to take a hike.\nAnd I have been a far, far happier man ever since. And probably a nicer\nman. The scars are still there and the damage is done, no getting away from\nthat. But with every passing year it all feels like it happened to someone else.\nThink big, act small. It's a recipe that never goes out of style. While espe-\ncially important for start-ups, it will serve you faithfully long after you have\nestablished yourself as a serious player. A successful and naturally modest\nentrepreneur is an object of reverence and respect in the business world.\nEven if such a fabulous beast is rarer than hens' teeth.\nAnd all ill all, it's a lot more fun than strutting around like some obnox-"

End of sermon.\nTHE FIFTH ERROR: SKIMPING ON TALENT\nIf you are determined to be rich, there is only one talent you require. Can\nyou think what it is before your eyes skim down to the next paragraph?\nRight. You need the talent to identify, hire and nurture others with\ntalent. 'There is no substitute for talent. Industry and al1 the virtues are of\nno avail,' wrote the novelist Aldous Huxley. I have never been much of a fan\nof his as far as literature is concerned, but in this Huxley is correct.\nAny company managed and run by plodders and jobsworths will be lucky\nto survive, let atone prosper. Talent is the key to sustained growth, and\ngrowth is the key to early wealth. You have to identify and hire talent. You\ncan't skimp on it.\nSometimes, to ensure that a talented individual will work for you, or will\nstay working with you, you need to be flexible. Money is not always the  \ngreat\nmotivator here. Talented people want a good salary, of course, but surpris-\ningly often they are more attracted to new opportunities and challenges.\nStephen Colvin, my CEO at Dennis Publishing in New York City, is a\ngood case in point. A Belfast lad who came to London and made a name for\nhimself selling advertising for Dennis, his obvious talent acted as a magnet\nfor my rivals. In secret (this is not as unusual as it sounds), one particular rival\nflew him and his wife, Pippa, to the west coast of America and tempted him\nwith a senior management position.\nStephen and Pippa were delighted with America and they decided to take\nthe chance to live and work there. Who could blame them? The USA is a\nlong way from the streets of Belfast.\nAs soon as I had heard the news, I acted. Stephen is not a greedy chap.\nPutting his salary up in the UK would not be enough to hold him. So what\ndid he want? He wanted to live and work in America.\nAt that time, I was busy losing money on my Blender CD-ROM in the\nStates and working with Peter and Bob on MicroWarehouse, a publicly\nquoted catalogue reseller of hardware and software we had founded some\nyears before. MicroWarehouse was a two-billion-dollar corporation and my\n\f\npublishing activities in the USA were more or less a sideshow.\nWhat could I offer Stephen Colvin to ensure that I preserved his talent\nfrom being poached? I asked Stephen to fly and meet me at my lakeside \ncottage\nin Connecticut. He wasn't too keen on the idea. He knew perfectly well  \nthat\nI was going to try to 'turn' him. And he knew, too, that I did not have a\nDennis operation in the States that would interest him. Nevertheless he  \ncame.\nWhen Stephen arrived, I took, him down to the dock and we boarded my\nboat. A few beers and a high-speed ride later, I cut the engine and we sat\nlooking at each other while the boat bobbed gently on the surface of\nCandlewood lake. I was careful not to break the delicious silence. Finally,\nStephen spoke: 'Felix, I'm not going to stay at Dennis. It's a great company\nbut I want to move on and Pippa and I want to come to America.'\nI nodded, And I swear to God, it was only at that moment that I realised\nwhat I might be able to do.\n'What is the position they're offering you?'\n'Vice president,' he replied.\n'How would you like to be president of an American company?'\n'What company?'\n'Dennis Publishing, Inc.'\n'There is no Dennis Publishing, Inc, Felix. Just Blender and a few bits\nand bobs.'\n'Ah, but there will be a Dennis Publishing, Inc, Stephen. And soon.'\n'What is it going to publish?'\n'What would you like it to publish, Stephen? You're the bloody president!'\nHe couldn't refuse. This was the chance he had always wanted. I was\ngoing to keep my talent and Stephen was going to come to America. As a\nlast added bonus, I told him that he, Pippa and his children could use my\nlake cottage whenever they wanted.\nA few years later he won an industry award as 'most valued young CEO in\nmedia' or some such nonsense. More importantly he built Dennis Publishing,\nInc for me brick by brick. And built his own reputation in the process.\n\f\nWhen you come across real talent, it is sometimes worth allowing them\nto create the structure in which they choose to labour. In nine cases out of\nten, by inviting them to take responsibility and control for a new venture,\nyou will motivate them to do great things. It is possible that I would have\nsucceeded in rebuilding Dennis in America without Steve's help. But I doubt\nthat it would have been as much fun. And I doubt, too, that we would have\nsucceeded to the degree we did.\nTalent is usually conscious of its own value. But the currency of that value\nis not necessarily a million-dollar salary. The opportunity to prove themselves,\nand sometimes the chance to run the show on a day-to-day basis, will often\ndo the trick just as well. This holds true even if talent is placed in the driver's\nseat of a small division within an existing operation. What talent seeks, as\noften as not, is the chance to prove itself and the opportunity to excel.\nMy advice on this subject was contained in the second paragraph of this\nsection. You must identify talent. Then you must move heaven and earth to hire\nit. You must nurture it, reward it property and protect it from being poached. If\nnecessary, dream up a new project. Better still, get the talent to dream it up.\nYouth is a further factor. By the time talent is in its mid-to-late forties or\nearly fifties, it will have become very, very expensive. Young talent can be\nfound and underpaid for a short while, providing the work is challenging\nenough. Then it will be paid at the market rate. Finally, it will reach a stage\nwhere it is being paid based on past reputation alone. That is when you must\npart company with it.\nThe French impressionist Degas once said: 'Everybody has talent at\ntwenty-five. The difficult thing is to have it at fifty.' True enough. Most\ntalent does not survive undiminished through its middle forties, although\nthere are some stunning exceptions to this rule of thumb.\nAnybody wishing to become rich cannot do so without talent. Either\ntheir own, or far more likely, on the back of the talent of others. Talent is\nindispensable, although it is always replaceable. Just remember the simple\nrules concerning talent: identify it, hire it, nurture it, reward it, protect it.\nAnd, when the time comes, fire it.\nIf you can do all these things with talent in the context of building your\nown company, I would be truly astonished if you did not become rich.\nBecause the truth is, talent does most of the work for you. Just as it has done\nsince the beginning of recorded history.\nAfter all, who built the pyramids? The pharaohs or the engineers?\n\f\nThink about it.\nThen go hire some talent - just like they did.\n\f\nPART THREE\nGETTING\nRICH\n\f\n9\nC A R D  I N  A L\nVIRTUES\nAnd slowly answered Arthur from the barge:\n'The old order changeth, yielding place to new,\nAnd God fulfils Himself in many ways,\nLest one good custom should corrupt the world.\nComfort thyself- what comfort is in me?'\nALFRED, LORD TENNYSON, MORTE D'ARTHUR\nIn this chapter, I intend to deal with the cardinal virtues of getting rich. I\nintend, too, to deal with some common misconceptions that have cropped\nup on those occasions when people have taxed me about how a guy like me\n(to misquote John Lennon) got richer than they did.\nOne thing is certain, it has little to do with merit or fairness. After all,\nwas Pete Best, the 'Fifth Beatle' that Brian Epstein forced to resign from the\noriginal group, really that much less of a drummer than Ringo Starr?\nProbably not. Who would want to end up a Fifth Beatle?\nPERSISTENCE\nIf at first you don't succeed, try, try, try again.\nThen quit. No use being a damn fool about it.\nW.C. FIELDS, AMERICAN HUMORIST (ATTR.)\nYou will find in the pages of most so-called 'self-improvement' books by\nquacks (defined as those who have never done it themselves but feel justified\nin pontificating about it), a great deal of drivel concerning the importance of\npersistence. In such books, this word is usually spelt with a capital 'P' and is\ntreated as an object of idolatry and reverence.\nFortunately, this is not a 'self-improvement' book. I do not believe\nanyone can be 'improved' by buying and reading a book. They can only be\n'improved', if that is the word, by their own actions.\nIf anything, How to Get Rich is something ever-so-slightly new in the\nworld, or at least I have tried to make it so. It is an 'anti-self-improvement'\nbook - because it admits openly that the chances of anyone reading it and\n\f\nthen becoming rich are minuscule. The vast majority of you are far too nice.\nAnd comfortable. And sensible.\nMy book points out, in harsh detail, the damage to your present\ncontentment and the risk to future and existing relationships that you run\nby seeking to get rich. It also deals with the coarsening of your nature that\nwill accompany the rough and tumble of acquiring a piece of the pie from\nanother's table. It points out, too, that avarice is tremendously time-\nconsuming and that time is in somewhat short supply - our lives are way\ntoo short.\nTo return to our subject, persistence is important, no doubt about it, and\nrequires a concerted effort of will and stamina to maintain. But it is not an\nend in itself.\nPersistence spelt with a capital 'P' (except at the beginning of a sentence)\nrepresents the same old error that one discovers in nearly all 'self-improve-\nment' books, not to mention in the men and women who write them.\nThey see a rich person with their finger pointing at the sky and, like the\nsaps they are, they stare at the finger. Then they write about the finger and\ncall their books: 'Become A Millionaire By Pointing Your Finger At The\nSky', not realising that their subject was merely attempting to draw their\nattention to a glorious sunset. No matter; such authors will stubbornly\npersist in their error. As do most of their readers.\nStubbornness is not persistence. Stubbornness implies you intend to\npersist despite plentiful evidence that you should not. A stubborn person\nfears to be shown he or she is wrong. A persistent person is convinced that\nhe or she has been right all along, and that the proof lies just around the\ncorner. That with just a little further effort, the veil of failure will be torn\naway to reveal success. And the difference is...?\nThe difference between the two is as crucial and as intangible as the dotted\nline on a map across a desert separating one country from another. These  \nlines\nappear to be of little importance. They are of no importance to the living  \ncrea-\ntures that inhabit the landscape. A desert gerbil does not think to itself, 'So\nnow I am crossing from the United Arab Emirates into Saudi Arabia.'\nBut at some time in the future, that dotted line that looked so pitiful to\nus a moment ago compared with the harsh realities of nature, may become\nterribly important. It may represent billions of dollars in oil revenues. It may\n\f\nmean the difference between wealth and mere subsistence.\n'Never give in' is a useful catchphrase. But don't take it too literally. We\nmust all surrender at some time, to love or desire or death. You will be forced\ninto the last of these, and a fool if you never surrender to the first. But never\ngive in easily. If you can, attempt one step further along the road than\nappears sensible before giving in.\nSo-called 'persistence' is a vital attribute for those who wish to become\nrich, or who wish to achieve anything worthwhile for that matter. As is the \nabil-\nity to acknowledge that one has made a mistake and that a new plan of action\nmust now be made. Any such acknowledgement is not a weakness, it is a sign\nof clear thinking. In its way, it is a kind of persistence in itself. Try, try, try \nagain,\ndoes not mean doing what has already failed, over and over again.\nQuitting is not dishonourable. Quitting when you believe you can still\nsucceed is. You must keep the faith. Belief in yourself and faith in your proj-\nect can move mountains. But not if you insist on trying to scale the moun-\ntain by an impossible route which has already failed.\nHistory is full of examples of success stories that very nearly had an\nunhappy ending - because it all seemed so hard, because of discouragement\nand the feeling that the gods were laughing up their sleeve at those involved.\nAnd often, because of a sneaking, horrible suspicion that while the destina-\ntion was right, the road map was badly flawed.\nYears ago, my American partners and I went into a new business, a mail-\norder business for personal computer software and hardware. Who was to be\nin charge of creating and designing our new mail-order catalogue? I was the\nnatural choice for this task. My experience in publishing so many personal\ncomputer magazines made it obvious.\nMy colleagues and I worked hard on this project. My chief designer was\neven sleeping in our New York offices to meet the deadline for a few weeks.\nIt was painstaking and exhausting work with no room for error. When we\nhad all the basic designs in place, I reviewed them carefully.\nThey were a flop. They didn't work. Something was wrong and we all\nknew it, I was beside myself with worry. This was such an important project\nand my partners, Peter and Bob, were relying on me to get it right. I almost\ncalled them and told them to give the project to someone else - which would\nnot have done much to foster friendly partnership relations. There was\n\f\nsimply no time in the launch deadline.\nBut what else could I do? The damn thing was just not right. I was on\nthe wrong track and found it difficult even to articulate what was wrong.\nWrong it was. But why?\nAn associate who had worked with me for some years, Susan Freeman,\nmade the crucial observation. She was neither a designer nor particularly\nknowledgeable about computers. But she had a keen eye and was involved\nin the project up to her neck, 'It looks rather like a magazine,' she said. 'It\ndoesn't look like a catalogue. That can't be right.'\nOf course! I had been urging my team, subconsciously, to create yet\nanother magazine. But mail-order catalogues do not have 'readers'. They\nhave potential buyers of goods. We had fallen into the trap of doing what we\nwere trained to do. We were in such a rush that, instead of starting out with\na blank sheet, we had moved onto automatic pilot. Every person on the team\nwas a magazine professional of some kind. Dumb, dumb, dumb.\nArmed with this insight we went back to a collection of successful cata-\nlogues of all shapes and sizes that Susan had gathered together at the begin-\nning of the project. Using these as a template, we persevered. Within days,\nwe had come up with a new catalogue design that worked so well it was still\nin use years later. Not to mention that many of the original elements we\nincorporated were later 'borrowed' by our rivals.\nPersistence had done the trick - but only with Susan's insight. Do not be\nafraid to change tack, alter course or make new plans with whatever you are\nattempting to achieve. Especially if you sense that you are on the wrong track.\nAbove all, avoid banging your head against the same piece of wall. The\nwall will not get any softer. And don't give up - if you want to be rich.\nSELF-BELIEF\nNo one can make you feel inferior without your consent.\nELEANOR ROOSEVELT\nThis is the core of it. Persistence is not quite as important as self-belief. I have\nknown people who believed in themselves, who acted on that belief, got lucky\nquickly and got rich. Persistence merely offers a second or third bite at the\ncherry. Your belief in yourself brought you to the cherry bowl in the first \nplace.\nSelf-belief is a priceless asset. We may detest arrogance, yet isn't it true\nthat we admire it a little, too? Even though arrogance is a poor, shabby thing\n\f\ncompared with rooted self-belief. It is an imitation of the real thing.\nWhy do we covertly admire such attributes? Because such people often\nhave what the ancients called 'the look of eagles' about them, which has little\nto do with their appearance. Single-handedly, individuals with ingrained self-\nbelief (and, usually, a dollop of arrogance) have changed the destiny of \nnations.\nWe have had one such in the past century in England. Perhaps he was a\nwarmonger. Perhaps he was an incompetent strategist and a jingoist and an\nempire builder and a silly old buffoon, especially about the rights of women.\nBut Winston Churchill's sense of his own destiny - his unshakeable self-\nbelief\n- was, for a while, all that Britain contained in its arsenal after Dunkirk.\nThere were few tanks and less artillery in England in 1940. The British\nExpeditionary Force had left them behind on the fields and beaches of\nBelgium and France, All that stood between a democratic, frightened people\nsuing for peace with a  treacherous madman intent on his dream of absolute\nEuropean domination, was a tired old man with a microphone - along with\na few hundred Spitfires and the remnants of the mightiest navy the world had\never known.\nWithin the British Cabinet and the British aristocracy there lay a hidden\nyearning for peace. Even an admiration for Fascism as a bulwark against the\nCommunist hordes. Peace at any price. Peace to save the world that had\nsupported and enriched Britain's aristocrats for countless generations. Peace,\neven though they knew full well what Hitler had already done in those  \ncoun-\ntries now swarming with what Churchill described as 'the odious apparatus\nof the Gestapo'.\nHis Cabinet colleague, Lord Halifax, would have made peace with Nazi\nGermany in an instant. As would Neville Chamberlain, the previous prime\nminister, known as 'the apostle of appeasement'.\nAnd if we had made peace, which would have meant disarming ourselves\nand handing over our air force and, perhaps, our navy to the Nazis, where\nwould Europe be now? And what language would we all be speaking? What\nwould our beliefs be? Which gods would we worship? How many millions\nupon millions of those among us would have 'disappeared'? And how many\nwould never have been born?\nIgnore his politics, and even his principles, by all means. But to read\n\f\nWinston Churchill's speeches today, and, better still, to hear his recordings\nof them, is to understand the astonishing power and mesmeric quality of\nself-belief.\nYounger men and women may mock all they wish but the iron determi-\nnation and self-belief of this one old man, this old man with a BBC micro-\nphone, meant more to Britain at that moment than all the kings and queens\nin her long history.\nFor just one moment, a democratic people were saved from fear of fail-\nure, and from the fear of fear itself; from the shame of capitulation to evil -\nby what? By one old man's belief in his own destiny, by his insane, unprinci-\npled self-belief, and the belief in the destiny of his country and of freedom\nin Western Europe.\nI am not asking you to be Winston Churchill. None of us could be, or\nwould necessarily want to be. He was a child of his time. But I do ask that\nyou begin, right now, right at this very moment, to ask yourself whether you\nbelieve in yourself.\nTruly. Do you believe in yourself? Do you? If you do not, and, worse still,\nif you believe you never can believe, then by all means go on reading this\nbook. But take it from me, your only chance of getting rich will come from\nthe lottery or inheritance. If you will not believe in yourself, then why should\nanyone else?\nWithout self-belief nothing can be accomplished. With it, nothing is\nimpossible. It is as brutal and as black and white as that. If you take no other\nmemory from this book, then take that single thought. It was worth a damn\nsight more than the price you paid for it, I assure you.\nWhich does not mean that you should trample on doubt. Doubts are like\npain. If pain was to be eliminated from humankind, how would we receive\nwarning that something was happening to our body requiring urgent atten-\ntion? In many situations, pain must be ameliorated - during surgical opera-\ntions, recovery from serious injury or in the throes of dying, for instance.  \nBut\nto eliminate pain entirely from our lives would not be a sensible objective or\nin our best interests.\nDoubt, too, is a warning system and plays its part in reaching decisions.\nAn important part. Without doubt, as was the case with Hitler's Youth\nBrigades, there is only naked ego and the kind of certainty that leads to\nuntrammelled arrogance, and worse. Sometimes far, far worse. There is\n\f\nnothing wrong with doubt, or with fear. They are immensely useful tools.\nBut you either learn to incorporate them into your thinking and your life, or\nyou will be ruled by them. There is no 'middle way'.\nIt is doubt multiplied by the fear of failure, unconfronted, which leads to\nthe creation of a vicious cycle where self-belief is eroded and nothing is\nachieved. Doubts can and should be confronted, as should fear. This is best\ndone in daylight, under rigorous examination. (Three o'clock in the morn-\ning is a difficult time to confront any such messengers.) Write down your\ndoubts and fears. Examine them. Hold them up to the light. Suck the\nwisdom out of them and discard their husks in the trash.\nAre there things that can be done to bolster self-belief? I believe there are,\nbut they are mostly beyond the remit of this little book. This book deals only\nwith the getting of wealth. I will leave you with two thoughts on the subject.\nFirstly, if you have ever escaped from very serious trouble indeed, or have\nbeen at the point of death, then one of two things happens. Either you\nbecome cautious to an absurd degree, or you are liberated from many ordi-\nnary fears. With liberation comes the knowledge that nothing is really very\nimportant in the lives of men; nothing is as terrifying as the fear itself. And\nfrom that, paradoxically, comes self-belief - a belief that anything is  \npossible.\nSecondly, you should remember that you are unique. Any scientist will\ntell you so. No other human was ever born, or will ever be born, with the\nsame combination of upbringing, flaws and qualities that you possess. Why\nshould you not believe in yourself?\nEven the fact of your existence, that you were created by the swiftest\nsperm of the millions let loose upon the luckiest of eggs that day, is a mira-\ncle. What were the odds that it would be you who would result? Yes, you,\nsitting in your chair reading these words right now. How then, could you  \nnot\nbelieve in yourself: Nature did. Destiny did. Or, if you wish, your God did.\nThis business of piling up wealth is an easy business. Easy, that is,\ncompared with giving birth, or raising children, or pressing on a parent's\ndoorbell at midnight to tell them their child has died in an accident. Or nurs-\ning children you know will never grow to adulthood, or pulling rocks on\nrollers under the lash of brutal overseers to build a monument to a deranged\npharaoh. How easy do they sound?\nIf you will only believe that you can do it and give it your best shot, then"

    "raw_text": "whether or not you succeed, you will perhaps dislodge a pebble that will\nricochet down the very small mountain of your life, creating an avalanche\nthat other fools will stand in awe of. You will not find me among them clap-\nping, but you will certainly find enough applause to repay you for the effort.\nYou may even grow to enjoy the process.\nIf you want to be rich you must work for it. But you must believe in it,\ntoo. You must believe in yourself, if only to armour yourself against the\nlaughter of the gods in your quest. Your mad quest to be rich.\nTRUST YOUR INSTINCTS\nCome to the edge.\nWe might fall.\nCome to the edge.\nIt's too high!\nCOME TO THE EDGE!\nAnd they came\nand he pushed\nand they flew. . .\nCHRlSTOPHER LOGUE, 'COME TO THE EDGE'\nTen years ago, somebody (I never did discover who) popped a copy of a new\nmagazine into the bag I leave in the reception lobby of Dennis Publishing's\nLondon headquarters. I'd never heard of it. It was slim. Very slim, indeed.\nNot usually a good sign for a magazine. And it was printed on low-grade\npaper with barely any advertisements. The design was basic, to say the least.\nIt even felt a bit grubby.\nBut I liked it. It was an old idea, remodelled. When Henry Luce co-\nfounded Time magazine back in 1923, his first instinct had been to create a\nnews digest, culled from news sources around the world. In the end, he  \ntook\na more expansive editorial route and built one of the greatest magazines ever\npublished in any language.\nThis one was called The Week. I read it twice through, slowly, on my jour-\nney back to Warwickshire that night. I doubt it took me an hour. The idea was\nsimple - though, as I found out later, not at all simple to execute. Excerpts\n\f\nand\nsnippets from scores of newspapers and other sources, all carefully credited,\nwere grouped together in sections. The columns had witty headlines like\n'Boring But Important' and 'It Must Be True, I Read It in the Tabloids'.\nThere were precis of articles from newspapers and magazines in Britain,\nEurope, America and Asia. (How had the editor translated some of them, I\nwondered?) There was a collection of maps with arrows pointing at cities\nand countries in the news that week. There were book, music and art\nreviews and sections on health, travel, technology and property. I especially\nliked the little box marked 'Health Scare of the Week' and the tiny 200-\nword 'Editor's Letter'.\nIt was cute. Clever. But it didn't stand a chance. It had no ads. No distri-\nbution clout. No marketing - or, surely, I would have heard of it? Not a\nchance in the world for The Week, then.\nSo of course I wrote a letter to its founder, Jolyon Conneli, who, it\nturned out, was an ex-Fleet Street journalist and editor, congratulating him\non his idea. I suggested he drop by my private office any time he was pass-\ning. Then I forgot about it, although a couple more editions found their way\ninto my hands in the months that passed.\nJolyon eventually did drop by. He was looking for investors. He already\nhad a ton of them, many of them his friends, but the amounts they had\ninvested were not large."

    "raw_text": "Everyone liked the idea, of The Week, and nearly everyone liked Jolyon,\nbut nobody was about to pony up hundreds of thousands of pounds to\nsupport it. He had sold his house in London to kickstart the project and had\nmoved his family to the country. Brave chap. It showed guts. I liked him,\nalthough we could not have come from more different backgrounds, or\nsported more different personalities.\nHindsight is a perfect science, and Jolyon may disagree with this version\nof history, but my recollection is that the writing was on the wall for The\nWeek. Without question its accounts were an absolute mess - not so unusual\nwith underfunded start-ups.\nSeveral large publishers have since implied that they would have invested\nif I had not. My answer to that is: why didn't they, then? After all, as Jolyon\nwas the first to point out, he had never heard of me, or Dennis Publishing.\nThe truth is that nobody else offered to invest big money in The Week\nbecause nobody else believed it could ever work financially. Not as a major\ntitle, anyway.\nMy board of directors at Dennis Publishing certainly didn't. They were\ndead against my investing in such a weekly. Weeklies eat up cash, especially\nweeklies with debts, no advertising, a pitiful number of subscribers, no news-\nstand sales and a bundle of small investors. Voices were raised in that board-\nroom. Loud voices.\nWhat I hadn't the courage to tell my fellow directors at that meeting, or,\nfor a day or two, even my financial guru, Ian Leggett, was that I had already\ninvested. I loved the concept. I was going to own a piece of The Week. And\nto hell with naysayers.\nThat's easy to say. But it's not good business. It's rude and arrogant to\ninvest in a company you intend to bring into your stable without a thorough\nand honest discussion of the pros and cons with senior colleagues. Like I\nsaid, it's not good business. But it is the only business an entrepreneur has  \nany\nright to be doing.\nI am not a manager. I am not even a businessman. I'm an entrepreneur\nand I go with my gut. After that, managers and bean-counters and financial\nadvisors take over. But only afterwards.\nI had the money and I had the 'feeling'. The 'feeling' is when the hair\nrises slightly on the back of your arms and neck and you know you are on\nthe scent of something you shouldn't be doing - but you're going to do\n\f\nanyway, it's called commercial instinct. You develop it over the years. You\ncertainly aren't born with it. I had it with The Week.\nWatching an experienced entrepreneur come into contact with a poten-\ntial pot of money is like watching a prone lioness raise her nose and sniff.  \nShe\ncuffs her cubs away. Then she sniffs some more. Then she rises and pads  \naway\nto hunt. Alone. She can't see it. She can't hear it. But she can scent it. She\nknows prey is close. It means food. Prey is her business. It's mine, too.\nSo I invested heavily in The Week. It lost money. What did you expect?\nIan Leggett was desperately concerned that I had bitten off more than I\ncould chew. He had a right to be concerned.\nI asked some talented people to help out from Dennis Publishing, care-\nful myself not to interfere with the creation of the editorial product. They\nalready had that right. It did not need messing with. The Week promptly lost\nmore money, so I bought out all of the minority investors, except for Jolyon\nConnell, the founder, and the editor, Jeremy O'Grady.\nSlowly, almost imperceptibly, The Week began to take off. I remember the\nthrill one evening when I heard a person I did not know at a dinner party\nquote straight out of my magazine. Even more unbelievably, readers began\nto proselytise. No, I mean it. Not just express satisfaction, but proselytise like\nreligious fundamentalists. Like true believers. In thirty years of publishing, I\nhad never seen anything like it.\nStrangers would buttonhole me at gatherings and tell me how many\nsubscriptions to The Week they were responsible for amongst their friends.\nThen they would demand that I did not change a thing in the magazine. I\nwas to leave the editorial alone, did I hear? I heard. I never had any intention\nof messing with it, although I did ask Jolyon and Jeremy to introduce obit-\nuaries and the weather into its pages, which they did. Imagine that: a maga-\nzine which reports on last week's weather!\nI met famous people, I mean really famous people: prime ministers and\npresidents and movie producers and A-list movie stars, who were only inter-\nested in talking to me because I owned The Week. Week by week with every\nissue the magazine gained more readers, a hundred extra a week, then two\nhundred, then three hundred. And nobody ever appeared to cancel their\nsubscription.\n\f\nYou can guess the result. The Week is now the most profitable magazine\nI own in the UK. Pound for pound (revenues divided by cost), it is the most\nprofitable magazine I have ever owned. Its margin is terrific. Today, it has\nmore paid subscribers in Britain than one of the most venerable magazines\nin the world, The Economist.\nThe Week has launched in the USA and is busy becoming a huge success\nthere, as well, under its editor-in-chief, William Falk, though it cost me $50\nmillion to get it to break even. Justin Smith, its general manager,  \napproached\na legend in the newspaper business, Sir Harold Evans, who swiftly perceived\nits potential. Harry is now editor-at-large for The Week in the USA - he was\nnever slow to spot a winner.\nTrust your instincts. Do not be a slave to them, but when your instincts\nare screaming, Go! Go! Go! then it's time for you to decide whether you  \nreally\nwant to be rich or not. You cannot do this in a deliberate, considered  \nmanner.\nYou can't get rich painting by numbers. You can only do it by becoming a\npredator, by waiting patiently, by remaining alert and constantly sniffing the\nair and by bringing massive, murderous force to bear upon your prey when\nyou pounce.\nYou can share the kill later, by all means. But if you want to get rich, trust\nyour own judgement when it calls - and leave those whose job it is to\nmanage your business to pick up the pieces. They can have the scraggy bits.\nBut the heart and liver are yours.\nMAKE MORE BASKETS: DIVERSIFY!\nAs it will be in the future, it was at the birth of Man-\nThere are only four things certain since Social Progress began-\nThat the Dog returns to his Vomit and the Sow returns to her Mire,\nAnd the burnt Fool's bandaged finger goes wabbling back to the Fire ...\nRUDYARD  KIPLING , THE GODS OF THE COPYBOOK  HEADINGS '\nEggs being what they are and the world being what it is, they will sometimes\nbreak. No matter how good your idea, how fierce your resolve and how\nlucky you are in the early days, you must prepare for that eventuality. It will\ncome. It always comes.\nI am one of the richest self-made men in Britain for two reasons. I own\nmy company outright, and I began to make more baskets the minute the first"

    "raw_text": "had a few eggs in it. Let's get down to how and why.\nForget the magazine business. Take any business and any idea. You need\nfocused, tunnel vision to get it on the road and to begin making some money.\nYou can expand it, maybe franchise it or take it to other cities or even other\ncountries. But, in reality, it is still the same basket with a lot more eggs in it.\nIf you had created a chain of fast-food stores, then it would be unwise to\nleave matters there. Public tastes change and customers are fickle. To protect\nyour investment, you would need to create new baskets. You would need to\nconsider, perhaps, the creation of or the acquisition of a soft-drink operation.\nOr of a branded coffee. And you don't have to be such a massively success-\nful chain to do it. Because, sometimes, the new basket will be worth more\nthan the old.\nTake Chock full o'Nuts. (Please!) This is probably the stupidest name ever\ngiven to a'first-rate coffee. (It's still hugely popular in New York City,  \nwhere\nI buy it myself at the local supermarket.) And why has it got such a dumb\nname? Because Mr William Black, who in 1923 founded a single store sell-\ning shelled nuts on Broadway and 43rd Street, built himself another basket.\nWhen he reached eighteen shelled-nut stores, he started to sell coffee.\nThe first basket paid the rent. But the second basket made a mint. His\ncoffee was good and his crazy advertising jingle on the radio was even  \nbetter.\n\"Better coffee a billionaire's money can't buy.' I can still hum it if you want.\nToday, Chock full o 'Nuts is owned by a large corporation. They dare not\nchange the weird name, but they have begun opening what they call Chock\nstores. I believe this is an error. Once a brand is established, any attempt to\nmess with the name reminds the world just how weird the name is. Not good\nmarketing.\nThe Chock full o'Nuts story contains another germ of truth, too. By\nconcentrating on selling coffee, its founder presumably ran down his  \nshelled-\nnuts business. If you want to buy shelled nuts (why?) today in New York\nCity, you don't automatically think of Chock full o'Nuts.\nStrangling your own baby, in order to grow, is far more common than\nyou might think. If you have a successful monthly magazine, for instance,\nand then launch a weekly in the same category, you will inevitably weaken\nsales of your original tide. This will follow as surely as night follows day. So\nshould you launch the weekly magazine?\n\f\nYes! A thousand times yes! Why? Because if you do not launch the weekly\nedition, even though you know it is a good idea, then your rivals will do it\nfor you. You will then be left with a damaged monthly and no weekly. This\nis called the 'Barbarians at the Gate' principle.\nLet's imagine you have a herd of sacred cows inside a fortress. The barbar-\nians are at the gate and you are under siege. Killing sacred cows is a horrible\ncrime, even though your defenders are running short of food. If the barbar-\nians overrun the fortress, the sacred cows will die anyway. If you kill some of\nthe cows, you will be stronger and possibly able to turn back the barbarian\nattack. Ergo, you eat one or two sacred cows - even if those same cows were\nthe meaning of life last week. Learning to evolve or die is a cardinal virtue.\nThis same argument has been used for centuries, both in commerce and\nin politics. Recently, the growth of the internet has begun to destroy the\nmusic industry. More and more people download songs without paying for\nthem, despite it being illegal. As a result, CD sales have been in tailspin and\nrecord companies have watched in horror as billions of dollars have been\nsucked out of the market, crippling their share price.\nThese record companies, who have grown fat for years by charging very\nhigh prices for little bits of cheap plastic, reacted foolishly, at first. They were\nfar too slow to begin devouring the sacred cow of the CD. What they wanted\nwas for the pirating and illegal downloading to stop. That's where they\nconcentrated their efforts. Dumb move. The barbarians were not about to\nquit any time soon.\nAfter all, what the record companies were faced with was nothing new. It\nwas merely a kind of forced diversification. What they should have been busy\ndoing, since the creation of the Napster website, let alone Apple's iPod, was\nweaving themselves new baskets - not defending the old, worn-out basket.\nToday, as a result of commercial pressure, that is exactly their strategy.\nLet's not be too hard on them. As you will discover when you start your\nown business, it's difficult and scary facing up to swiftly changing realities on\nthe ground. Most of us would prefer that things stayed the same so that we\ncan carry on making money in ways we have grown comfortable with.\nBut things do not stay the same. Either you learn to go with the flow and\nchange as rapidly as you are able, or you will be left stranded, like the last\ndinosaur, by the last warm take, on the last continent the ice age has yet to teach.\nLet's take another example of building more baskets just as quickly as\n\f\nyou can. Richard Branson has done it. Some of his Virgin enterprises are not\nas strong as others (did you ever try Virgin Cola?), but that's not the point.\nWestern capitalism will have to sink into an ocean of darkness before all of\nRichard's Virgin businesses go broke.\nHe has built scores of baskets, ranging from financial services to airlines,\nfrom music super-stores to railway passenger services. He's a canny man. I\nknow from experience. I used to wake him up occasionally on his longboat,\nmoored in central London. Before I even got a mouthiful of coffee for break-\nfast, I was answering his damn telephones, ringing off the hook while he\nshowered. In those days, he was probably showering in his trademark jumper.\nRichard has perfected one cardinal rule: he owns or part-owns more baskets\nthan almost anyone alive. It's certainly one way to become a billionaire.\nHow many baskets should you go for? As many as make sense. In the\nbeginning, it would be best, if you can, to keep them related to your core\nbusiness. Just like Richard did. He started off importing 'grey' record\nalbums from the USA - they were the illegal downloads of their time, except\nthey weren't tree. Richard followed up with record stores and then a record\ncompany. Or was it the other way around? No matter. Different apples. But\nbasically all from the same orchard.\nYou will not have to be as exceptional as Richard Branson to get rich. But\nhis policy is a good one. No, a great one. I've failed the basket test a few\ntimes, and perhaps I should confess to one or two of them.\nO When I had the chance (i.e. when flush with cash), I should have bought\nmore magazines. Even a newspaper, if I could have afforded it. Local\nnewspapers, until recently, made a ton of money from their classified ads,\nI missed a trick there.\nO I should have considered going into radio or television production earlier\nthan I did. Many popular television shows are based loosely on a 'maga-\nzine' format. There are a lot of similarities in the boys and girls who\ncreate television and create magazines. Not to mention the content.\nO I should have invested in one or two internet start-ups I knew were going\nto do well. That was a stupid error and came about because, by then, I\nwas spending too much time each day writing poetry. No excuse, though.\nThere would be other tricks I missed, if I could bring myself to evaluate\nthem. But nobody likes to dwell on past failures. They're just too painful.\n\f\nOf course, not all baskets are worth investing in. Dennis Publishing did\na great job as far as the internet was concerned. While most of the big maga-\nzine companies in the world were pouring cash into massive internet expan-\nsion seven or eight years ago, we decided to back off.\nThe sums being bandied about were insane. One British publishing\ncompany I know planned to invest $50 million over a couple of years on\ntheir internet business, housed in some massive building to give them room\nto expand. (It never did expand. It sank.) This strategy was executed solely\nto assuage institutional investors. Who knew nothing about the current state\nof play on the internet. Naturally.\nDennis Publishing built its websites carefully and well. We stuffed them\nwith content and we advertised them in the pages of our magazines. But we\ndidn't allow ourselves to be suckered into weaving a basket the size of the\nSuper Bowl which would be obsolescent before it returned a penny. We\ncouldn't afford to.\nThis sensible policy was mainly the result of Guy Sneesby, who still works\nfor me. Despite loving the internet and everything about it, he was dead\nagainst throwing money at it. 'Wait until it grows. Match investment with\ngrowth. Make it pay,' was his game plan. Turned out he was right. Probably\nsaved me $10 million or so. Maybe more. Thanks, Guy. (You see, it pays to\nhire talent smarter than you are.)\nMeanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic, Guy's counterpart in my\ncompany there was a long-time Dennis staffer, a British ex-pat called Roger\nMunford. Roger has never been known to waste a buck. He's naturally thrifty.\nHis second name is 'Frugal'. I have always suspected that when Roger's coffee\nfrom Starbucks goes cold, he warms it up in the microwave. More than  \nonce!\nRoger was running Dennis's American internet division, and his instinct\nwas similar to Guy's. But he spotted that things were different over there.\nMost magazines sell more copies via a paid subscription than on the news-\nstand in America - quite the opposite situation a publisher is faced with in\nBritain and Europe. Obtaining paid magazine subscriptions is a costly busi-\nness. On average, it can cost between fifty and one hundred dollars to obtain\na 'live' subscriber - one who will eventually renew their subscription and pay\noff the cost of having attempted to acquire scores of others.\nStill with me? So Roger goes into overdrive when he finds he can sell\nsubscriptions on the Maxim website. This strategy isn't working for Guy in\nthe UK, but who cares? It's working in the USA. So Roger, that thrifty,\n\f\nfrugal soul, begins pouring hundreds of thousands of dollars of my money\ninto our American internet operation, weaving a massive new basket we\nnever knew existed.\nIt must have been painful for him, but it paid off. We were selling\nsubscriptions for pennies instead of fifty or sixty bucks a time. Hundreds of\nthousands of bloody subscriptions. It was exciting, it made great sense, and\nit allowed us to build the Maxim website into one of the most powerful\ninternet portals for young men in North America.\nAnd the beauty was, the newsstand purchasers of the ink-on-paper\nversion of Maxim had paid for it. They had provided the cash to invest in  \nour\nwebsite. Thanks, Roger. (You see, it pays to hire talent smarter than you  \nare.)\nJust remember that this advice is not designed for your start-up phase.\nDuring the start-up, you concentrate on that one basket as if your life (and\nthe life of your first-born) depends upon it. But once you have something\nthat's working and making some money, start looking around quickly for\nanother opportunity. The more baskets the better.\nDiversifying not only ensured that I had more chances to lay eggs and\nsomewhere to incubate them, it also gave me the confidence to concentrate\non any one egg at any one time. When one of my projects was in trouble  \nand\nneeded more work, or needed rethinking, the fact that I had other eggs in\nother baskets gave me the confidence to do what was right. Like re-engi-\nneering or folding it.\nOne of the problems with being a start-up entrepreneur is that you tend\nto think of what you have created as some kind of surrogate child. It  \nbecomes\nyour 'baby', if you're not careful. This is dangerous and counter-productive.\nYou are not in the egg-laying and basket-weaving or baby business. You are\nin the business of getting rich.\nIf you have only one set of eggs in one basket, then selling it (let alone\nfolding it), can be surprisingly hard. The thought of letting go because it's\njust not working may be more than you can bear, however logical such a\ndecision is. By having other eggs doing well in other baskets, you ensure  \nthat\nyou can approach such problems at least semi-dispassionately. (It will only  \nbe\n\f\n'semi'; trust me.)\nIt's for this reason that I am often, along with my group CFO, Ian\nLeggett, the only one voting to close down one project or another at my\nvarious companies. To the young people involved in that project, it is a\nmatter, seemingly, of life or death. To a man with many other fish to fry, it\nis just another problem in need of a solution.\nThe reverse of that medal, of course, is that I do not bring to any proj-\nect the passion and insight of those more closely involved. Even so, by  \ndiver-\nsifying and building other baskets in other countries, I believe I have become\nbetter able to make hard decisions more often. That's a definite plus.\nThe biggest basket I ever built wasn't my first or second. It was my twen-\ntieth. But if I hadn't built the second, I would never have reached the twen-\ntieth. And maybe, just maybe, I have a couple more baskets yet to build.\nLISTEN AND LEARN\nThen the Gods of the Market tumbled, and their smooth-tongued\nwizards withdrew.\nAnd the hearts of the meanest were humbled and began to believe it was true,\nThat All is not Gold that Glitters, and Two and Two make four-\nAna the Gods of the Copybook Headings limped up to explain it once more.\nRUDYAKD KIPLING, 'THE GODS OF THE COPYBOOK HEADINGS'\nA lot of strangers ask to come and see me during the course of a year. And I\nmean a lot. I have three highly trained, full-time personal assistants at my\nprivate offices just handling the calls. In fact, they share another assistant\nwho answers the phones - a kind of assistant to the assistants.\nYou might think that's excessive or just showing off. But if you were\nthere in the middle of a busy day, you'd revise your opinion. The only\ndescription that comes close is organised chaos. Pretty often I find myself in\ntwo meetings at once. Which is why I have a connecting set of stairs to my\nflat upstairs from the offices. There just aren't enough meeting rooms, and\na kitchen table always makes for a friendly substitute.\nNot for me the quiet executive office floor with minions toiling their\nnuts off down below while I smoke huge cigars and ready myself for a  \nsooth-\n\f\ning massage. I want to be where people can reach me on certain days of the\nweek. Why? Because I want to hear what they have to say.\nThat's not because I'm a sociable chap. In fact, there's little I like better\nthan my own company. But when you stop listening, you stop learning. And\nif you stop learning, it's time to get out of the kitchen and let someone else\ndo the cooking.\nListening is the most powerful weapon after self-belief and persistence\nyou can bring into play as an entrepreneur. And yet I'm familiar with  \nnumer-\nous senior executives running large companies who might spend two or\nthree weeks in between listening to a 'stranger' - or a 'minion'.\nTalking to your own executives and senior managers is necessary, of\ncourse. But talking to people you do not know, or who work in some\nobscure corner of your industry (or even in your own company), is just as\nnecessary. More so, perhaps.\nIf you have experience, a little investment cash and will make the time,\nthen the world will bring to your door an amazing collection of visionaries,\ncon artists, madmen and budding entrepreneurs. They all have something to\nsay. Most of your time will be wasted. But what is not wasted will make you\nricher. Much richer.\nA digression. Allow me to slip in here a few words concerning courtesy.\nI cannot give it a chapter or even a subheading to itself, because being cour-\nteous and always failing merely makes you a courteous loser. Courtesy is  \nnot\na cardinal virtue in getting rich, I admit. But it helps. It works. It greases\nwheels where force will not prevail. Out of the mouth of anyone on their  \nway\nto becoming rich, it lends a certain gravitas and creates the impression of\nsomeone you might like to do business with. This is true in any country in\nthe world, in my experience, but it is especially true in the USA. Americans\nworship courtesy almost as much as they worship money.\nBut the courtesy of listening is not an excuse for inaction. Unfortunately,\nthis is often the very use to which it is put. How virtuous we all feel listen-\ning, taking notes, interjecting our own two-penny-worth and promising to\nconsider the matter and get back to whoever has come to visit. Trouble is,\nbusiness is not a talking shop. It relies on decisions, often hard decisions,\nbeing made in as short a time as makes sense.\nMy advice, based on thousands of such meetings over the years, is to\n\f\nkeep them short - unless your gut tells you that you have stumbled upon a\nwinner. Set the meeting for twenty minutes. Have somebody interrupt you\nafter twenty-five minutes and usher the caller swiftly from your room.\nIt's usually better to leave no doubt in your visitor's mind if you're not\ninterested in their project or idea. In a way, it's kinder, as well. While the\ntemptation is to say, 'I'll confer with my colleagues and get back to you,' this\nwill eventually come back to haunt you and waste more of your most valu-\nable resource. Time.\nI'm feeble at this balance between courtesy and efficiency and always\nhave been, but I've got a little better over the years - especially with the help\nof my personal assistants, Wendy, Caroline and Amy. They're trained to\ninterrupt me if they sense either my visitor or I is flying on autopilot. And\nthey can be ruthless about it!\nPiling up meeting upon meeting in a brutal schedule actually helps. Your\nvisitor sees others waiting to see you and will procrastinate less. If you do\nneed time to mull over a suggestion, then make it clear that it will be you\ngetting back to them. People with an idea are desperate, and will call and call\nand call unless you set clear ground rules.\nNow let's talk about ideas and who owns what. If someone comes to see\nyou with an idea you're already considering or are already working on (no\nmatter how loose the connection), then stop them, abruptly and tell them the\nsituation. That's only fair. It is curiously common for new ideas to arrive\nindependently from more than one source at a time. Science can't explain it,\nand neither can I, but it's a fact, all the same.\nIdeas, by the way, cannot be 'owned' by anyone. You cannot trademark\nor patent or copyright any idea. You can only protect the execution of the idea\nand trademark the name. This is an important thing to know in any business\nand is often misunderstood by people who come to you with an idea. Such\npeople often request you sign an NDA (a Non-Disclosure Agreement), and I\nam usually happy to do so.\nWhy? Because the force in law of most NDAs is [united and they do not\nwork in the way most people think they do.\nFor example, the idea for 3M's Post-it Note could be described as\nfollows: Taper of any size, one edge of which which will attach itself by way\nof gum to most surfaces, especially paper, and which can be detached, with-\nout leaving a residue or mark.' A lawyer would shorten that to 'paper with a\nrepositionable adhesive'. No matter. If you had tried taking that description\nto the patent office after 3M's research scientist, Dr Spencer Silver, discov-\n\f\nered the adhesive but before Art Fry, a 3M new-product researcher, hit upon\na use for it - it would have availed you nothing. Why?\nBecause 3M owned the formula for the gum. The formula was a way of\nexecuting the idea. If you had come up with an even better gum and had\ncreated your own name for such notes and marketed them, then 3M would\nhave had a devil of a job to stop you, because no one can copyright or patent\nan idea. You can only protect the execution of the idea, which must be unique.\nIf your gum really was unique, you would be in business. And what a business!\nSimilarly, the Walt Disney Corporation does not own the rights to all\nimaginary talking mice. Talking animals existed in the minds of writers and\nartists long before Walt Disney himself was born. The Disney Corporation\nonly owns the 'look and feel' (and a host of other attributes) of two partic-\nular talking mice, Mickey and Minnie Mouse. If you are in the business of\nexecuting ideas to make money, then this is something you are going to have\nto come to grips with and become a minor expert on. There are many books\nto help you out there.\nTo get back to our meetings where people are attempting to persuade you\nto consider their idea or project: what about ideas put forward by a member\nof your own staff? What if they come up with an idea which the company then\ndevelops and which proves to be a huge success. Who owns it?\nThe answer is that the company does. You do, if you are the owner of the\ncompany and your employee put forward the idea in the course of working\nfor you. (Now do you see why you must always hire people more talented\nthan you?) The only exception to this would be if an agreement had been\nentered into between you and your employee, or between the company and\nits employee, or if the idea had nothing to do with your industry and had\nbeen conceived (and developed) in the employee's own time, using no\ncompany materials.\nOther than that, in the ordinary course of business, you do not owe your\nemployee a single cent for bringing his or her idea forward. That's especially true\nif your money, or your company's money, was used to test and develop the idea.\nThis seems unfair. It was her idea. She pushed it forward and probably\nworked very hard on it. Shouldn't she enjoy some of the financial benefits of\nher idea? We'll get back to that, but first let's look at another scenario. The\nnon-employee who comes in with a thumping great idea and wants you and\nyour company to help execute it."

    "raw_text": "This is a different kettle of  fish. You must proceed cautiously. Just\nbecause NDA agreements usually have little force, doesn't mean you can be\ncavalier and reckless. How far has this person gone towards executing the\nidea? If she came to see you and said, 'I have an idea for a coloured note that\ncan be stuck onto paper, that you can write on, and that can be removed later\nwithout leaving a mark,' then she is a fool. She should not have come to you\nwithout protecting that idea very, very carefully indeed.\nHowever, if she then brought out a sample that did not work very well,\nbut which worked to some degree, the case is altered. She has executed her\nidea, however badly. If you wish to invest in the idea, you would almost\ncertainly have to come to a legal agreement with the inventor.\nThis all sounds hypothetical and theoretical. But it's not, you know. In\nmore situations than you might imagine, it becomes critical. Ownership is\nall. When who owns what is in dispute, the only people who are going to get\nrich are the lawyers. There have been many, many bitterly contested owner-\nship disputes in business which not only wrecked the companies involved,\nbut destroyed the sanity of the main participants. The invention of the tele-\nvision set in America was one such.\nBut what of the young lady who works for your company and brought\nyou (or her manager), the great idea that worked so well? What of her?\nThat's up to you, buddy. You're the owner. If you're a sensible, decent,\nworthwhile human being, you will reward her handsomely and promote her.\nAnd you will thank her publicly.\nIf you're a rotten, ingrate scumbag, without any decent feelings what-\never, you will not reward her. And you'll get rich. But perhaps not quite as\nrich as a more enlightened owner. Because if your clever employee has had\none such great idea, she may well have another later. And she is unlikely to\nstay working for a company that stiffed her so badly, or to hand them\nanother gem, is she?\nI'm fully aware that this isn't a book about becoming a worthwhile\nhuman being. As I keep attempting to drum into you, riches aren't particu-\nlarly worthwhile in themselves in any case. They don't make anyone a better\nperson, at least as far as I have seen. But listening continuously, listening and\nlearning, is one of the vital components for those of you who wish to be  \nrich.\nWhat you choose to do with your loot is up to you.\nBut listen and learn if you want to be rich! 1 0\n\f\nA FEW WORDS\nABOUT LUCK\nBorn under a bad sign\nI been down since I began to crawl\nIf it wasn't for bad luck,\nI wouldn't have no luck at all.\nBOOKER. T. JONES AND WILLIAM BELL, 'BORN UNDER A BAD SIGN'\nTHE INVINCIBLE WORM OF DOUBT\nArmy chaplains who have seen bullets fly, sometimes boast that 'there are no\natheists in the foxholes'. In the same way, as bullets fly around our head in\nlife, most of us are believers in luck. Secret believers for the most part, it's\ntrue. But believers none the less.\nThe major religions of the world have worked tirelessly over the centuries\nto eradicate 'superstitions' among their flock; 'superstitions' which appear to\nmock, or at least to be at odds with, 'holy' writ. Which is another word for\nsupernatural dogma. In this, they are at one (just for once) with philosophers\nand scientists, although for very different reasons. And it is true that a great\nmany ancient superstitions no longer hold very much sway in large parts of\nthe world. But with 'luck', and with omens of good or evil fortune, scien-\ntists, philosophers, religious leaders and wise men have, for the most part,\nlaboured in vain.\nYou think not? How many times have you 'knocked on wood', perhaps\nrising from your chair to find a piece of wood to knock upon, or even tapped\nyour head in a self-deprecating nod to the pagan gods of fortune? Many\ntimes, I would wager. I do it myself, and so do most people I know, however\nsheepishly.\nWe are all in thrall to Lady Luck, and therefore to superstition. Even\nthose of us who rolled our eyes in disbelief when we heard that Nancy\nReagan insisted on consulting an astrologer before allowing her husband,\nthe most powerful man in the world at that time, to sign a disarmament\nagreement with the Russians. Even those of us who roared with laughter\nrecently when yet more revelations emerged of odd and arcane behaviour\ninvolving the use of 'healing crystals' at No. 10 Downing Street. Not that\nthe crystals were the half of it.\n\f\nWe may mock Mrs Blair and Mrs Reagan all we like, but this invincible\nworm of doubt, this nagging feeling that some are born to win and some are\nborn to lose, that we can perhaps propitiate Fortune with ritual or prayer or\nsacrifice - this deathless wriggler infests most of us, to one degree or  \nanother.\nSo what can we do about it on our quest to get rich?\nThe truthful answer, of course, is nothing. We can do nothing at all. And\nevery word I now type opens me to well-deserved mockery and contempt\nfrom those very few souls (a Freudian slip, that last word, I'm afraid), who\nsteadfastly deny the existence of any such thing as luck. Or destiny. Or the\ngods of good fortune.\nAnd yet, and yet ... Just like you, I have seen it at work. I have watched\nmy own idiocy transformed by a piece of good fortune. I have stood,  \namazed,\nas catastrophe transformed itself into another chance - or, even more ridicu-\nlously, into a home run. And I have witnessed genuine achievement and hard\nwork undone by a series of astonishingly unlikely events - mostly in others, I\nhasten to add. (I have just realised that those last seven words were a nod to\nthe gods of good fortune. I shall leave them there as a penance.)\nThen there is negative luck, or luck disguised. When I was thinking small\nand acting big in the late 1980s, I collapsed at my cottage in Connecticut.\nIt later transpired that I had contracted legionnaire's disease in a hotel in\nLos Angeles.\nLegionnaire's, caused by the bacterium Legionella pneumophila,, which\nbreeds in the air-conditioning units of hotels, hospitals and other large build-\nings, is a killer. It is especially lethal to coked-up, overweight, cigarette-\nsmoking, malt-whisky-swilling idiots with too much money who believe they\nare built of titanium.\nAfter the plane had touched down in New York, I insisted that my chauf-\nfeur drive me straight to the cottage, despite his appeals to take me to a\nhospital closer to the airport. My real reason was that I had a girlfriend wait-\ning at the cottage and I knew she would be frightened to spend the night\nthere alone. She was also a very beautiful girl - even when men are dying\nthey think of sex! Little did I know that sex would be off the menu for the\nnext few months.\nThat irrational decision, made in severe pain and through waves of\nnausea, saved my life. It was lucky, although I didn't feel too lucky at the\ntime. It was luck disguised.\n\f\nHospitals in Connecticut have 24-hour diagnosticians on duty.\nConnecticut is one of the richest states, per capita, in the union and the\nemergency wards of their hospitals in no way resemble the scrum and chaos\nof many an inner-city hospital in large cities nearby. Within minutes of being\nrushed to Danbury Hospital by my cottage neighbour (more luck: he was a\npharmacist and knew a potentially lethal fever when he saw one), the diag-\nnostician there made a brave and, as it turned out, correct diagnosis.\nIf I had taken my chauffeur's advice, it might have been hours, even days,\nbefore a harassed and frantic A&E doctor in a New York City hospital finally\ndiagnosed a set of bewildering and very rare symptoms. By then, of course,\nI would have slipped into a pulmonary coma from which there could have\nbeen no return.\nThat disease was also double luck disguised for me. It forced me to\nchange my way of life. I came so very close to death that it jolted me back\nto reality. How close? Close enough for the doctors to ask what my religion\nwas. Did I want to see a minister or a priest?\nI am proud to report that, lying there on a bed of ice hooked up to more\ntubes than you'd find in a sack of spaghetti, I managed a weak joke through\ngritted teeth, which raised a laugh from a pretty nurse. She was thoughtfully\npouring ice water on my genitals to keep me awake at the time. 'No minis-\nter or priest, thank you, doc. But do you have a venture capitalist handy?'\nLet's return to the altogether happier world of making money and\ndisguised luck. I once made several million pounds through a piece of luck\nthat was also pretty heavily disguised at the time. Back in 1990, things were\ngoing well at my British company. Or so we all thought. I was busy with my\npartners in America building a brand new beast that needn't concern us here.\nThe UK company had expanded so fast we were operating out of five\nseparate locations in an area of central London called Fitzrovia. This was\nobviously an inefficient state of affairs. The managing director of Dennis\nPublishing at that time was a fully qualified accountant who had once been\nour finance director.\nLesson No. 1: Never make your finance director or CFO the MD or\npresident of anything!\nSecure in the knowledge that our finances were in good order and we\nwere making a decent profit, I asked my MD (we will call him Christopher,\nalthough that is not his real name) to scout around for a new headquarters"

    "raw_text": "building in Fitzrovia. He found one. An absolute beauty. We could not\nafford to buy it, of course, but we could certainly afford the rent because of\nall the savings we would make by working together under one roof.\nNegotiations commenced and were concluded on Christmas Eve, I was\nalready on vacation in the Caribbean with a gaggle of girlfriends, inhabiting\nseveral hotel suites and villas.\nLesson No. 2: Never go on vacation when a deal is going down.\nI was so proud of our new headquarters building that I actually took a\nphotograph of it with me on holiday. It was called Chadwickham House and\nstill stands today in Bolsover Street, London. It's an odd but elegant struc-\nture, which might be described by a cockney lad as 'all mouth and no\ntrousers'. That is, it's more show than substance. But what a show!\nThe frontage of Chadwickham House is immense, guarded by imposing\nwrought-iron railings. It features numerous stone gargoyles on pillars and\nliterally scores of panelled windows. The entrance portico is handsome and\naustere. Unfortunately, the building had very little depth. But who cared? It\nabsolutely looked the business and was more than big enough for us.\nThen came a fateful telephone call. My vacation was wrecked.\nChristopher had been so busy as managing director he had not been watch-\ning our accounts closely enough. Far from making a big fat profit, Dennis\nPublishing UK had barely broken even that year. A black hole had appeared\nin our annual accounts and we had been living in a fool's paradise. There  \nwas\nabsolutely no impropriety or shady dealings going on. It was just faulty\naccounting, exacerbated by a change in our computer accounts package.\nLesson No. 3: When you change accounting systems (or accountants, for\nthat matter), have the numbers checked over and over again. I'll eat my hat\nif errors are not discovered in the next iteration.\nLooking back, I suspect Christopher shouldered a great deal of the\nblame that belonged to others. But that is what MDs and presidents and\nCEOs are paid for. If it happens on their watch, then they must bear the\nresponsibility. To his credit, Christopher did just that, although I suspect he\naged a year during the crisis.\nDesperately we attempted to back out of the Chadwickham House deal.\nNo dice. There was no escape clause. I flew back to London and underwrote\na loan at a very nasty rate of interest. That was foolish. By this stage in my\nlife I should not have been personally underwriting business loans.\n\f\nLesson No. 4: Never personally underwrite business loans for your\ncompany unless you absolutely, positively, are forced to. Even then, set  \nlimits\nin the agreement so that, as the loan figure is reduced over time, you are\nreleased from your undertakings commensurately.\nDennis Publishing moved into its fancy new headquarters. We were happy\nwith them, but remained as poor as church mice for a few months.\nChristopher was offered a new job by a rival publisher based in America. He\ntook it and still resides today on the west coast of America; very happily, I\nmight add. I appointed a new MD and a new finance director. Life moved  \non.\nA while later, my partners and I made a killing in America and I found\nmyself awash with cash. Tens of millions of pounds of cash. Naturally I set\nabout spending it just as fast as was humanly possible, which, in my case,\nmust have set some kind of world record.\nNew cars, new houses, new women and new wine cellars. But I'm not a\ncomplete fool and my new finance director, Ian Leggett, proved to be a gem.\nHe forced me to invest in a few sensible things apart from the company itself,\nOne of them was Chadwickham House. I bought the property from the land-\nlords for a song and sold it six or seven years later, when we moved to an  \neven\nlarger office block. The profit was handsome. Very handsome indeed.\nLesson No. 5: Listen to people who are good with money and always\ninvest in property with a good address - providing you can pay cash for it\nand will not need to sell it for a few years.\nSo where did the negative, disguised luck come in? It came in the shape\nof the black hole in the 1990 company figures. Think about it.\nIf we had known the truth, I would never have entered into a lease for a\nfancy new building. I would then not have been in a position, as a tenant, to\npurchase it from the landlords. After all, I'm not in the property business.\nFurthermore, we would not have been in a position to squeeze a sensational\nprice from the property developer who subsequently bought it from me. (He\nwas forced to pay above the odds because Ian discovered that Chaduickham\nHouse was slap bang in the middle of a city block the developer had been\nacquiring site by site.)\nIt wasn't a clever business brain that made me all that money. It was\ndumb luck. But I was ready to seize the opportunity that disguised luck\nhad delivered."

    "raw_text": "One of my favourite philosophers, the first-century Roman Seneca,\ncoined the following: 'Luck is what happens when preparation meets\nopportunity.' I have never come across a better definition - that's why I'm\nrepeating it. Preparation multiplied by opportunity. Say it again. Learn it off\nby heart. Let it become a daily mantra. Luck is preparation multiplied by\nopportunity.\nOver the centuries this has morphed into cracker-barrel soundbites, as in\nthe golfer Gary Player's: 'It's a funny thing, luck. The harder I practised, the\nluckier I got.' But the original is far more profound and Seneca's quote is\nworth a moment of our time. Preparation is the key. Be prepared. Do the\nheavy lifting and the homework in advance. Get on with the job, but remain\nalert enough to spot an opportunity when it arrives. Then hammer it.\nIf you haven't prepared yourself, the opportunity will go begging. It will\nbe yet another regret in your life, another 'if only ...' And even if you have\nprepared, but are too busy, probably buried in the minutiae of management,\nor a messy divorce, or moving house, or a hundred and one other things,  \nthen\nluck will again evade you. Months or years later you will be saying, 'If only I\nhad spotted that opportunity. I was ready for it, but I wasn't paying attention.'\n'If only...' are the two saddest words in the English language.\nThen there is the case of a man I have known for thirty years. He is a\nbetter publisher than I am and has been a better publisher since we both set\nout on our own back in the early 1970s. He is a better businessman, too. He\nnetworks more and is always one of the first to understand which way the\nwind is blowing. His writing skills are way above my own - not that that's\nsaying much, I know. But even so, good writing skills can be important in\nour business.\nHe listens to others more often and more closely. He is a fierce but fair\nnegotiator and has more patience than I. And, by God, he has needed more\npatience, more patience than Job.\nLike a modern-day version of that tormented biblical figure, misfortune\ndogs him. No sooner has he struck gold than it crumbles into dross. No\nsooner has he dug another mine than it fills with water nobody guessed was\nthere. Nothing will work. Nothing has ever really worked for him. It must\nbe absolutely galling.\nHis personality has changed for the worse in recent years. He now\nexhibits, perhaps not unnaturally, a degree of resentment towards those  \nwho\n\f\nhave done so much better with so much less talent and less determination. I\nnotice I have begun to avoid his company. And so have others.\nIs it because I feel guilty? Is it because I wish to avoid his flashes of bitter-\nness and dark humour? Is it because I am leery of vile, involuntary gloating?\nOr is it because in some pagan corner of my heart, I believe that bad luck\nmight be contagious?\nI don't know the answer to that. But I do know that he ought to be rich.\nAt least as rich as I am, and perhaps a great deal richer. So what is it that  \nsepa-\nrates us? Perhaps a dispassionate analysis will help to us to peer dimly into  \nthe\nmurky world of what we humans call 'luck' and 'misfortune'.\nTHE NATURE OF ALBERT'S MISFORTUNE\nYou will find a great deal of poetry in this book. Both by me and by much\nbetter poets. There's a good reason for that. Poetry forces a writer to\ncondense and crystallise his thoughts and often represents a short cut to\ntruths unsuspected by the author himself. Here's a short poem I wrote a\nwhile ago concerning the laws of unintended circumstance and 'luck'.\nTwo Left Feet\nThe laws of unintended consequence\nHave nimble limbs; they mesmerise the dance.\nWith two left feet, our dancing makes no sense:\nAre not all ballerinas born by chance?\nPerhaps- But I shall tell what I have learned-\nThe gods of fortune recognise no debt;\nBouquets strewn on a stage are mostly earned,\nAnd luck is one more dividend of sweat.\nBut is luck just 'a dividend of sweat'? How many times can one person 'dust\nthemselves down, pick themselves up and start all over again' before they\nlose heart? I have already mentioned Winston Churchill's 'If you're going\nthrough hell, keep going'. All very well if you are a cigar-smoking, ageing\nhero at the nadir of his career, who is nevertheless certain he is destined for\n\f\ngreatness. But what about the rest of us?\nThe only truth about luck, good or bad, is that it will change. The law\nof averages virtually guarantees it. And here, I think, is one difference that\nseparates me from my 'unlucky' friend, whom I shall eall Albert.\nAlbert is so close to the cross currents of the market that his antennae lead\nhim astray. When he hits yet another bump on the road, or has a head-on colli-\nsion, he attempts to change his luck by changing direction. It's not that he\nlacks stamina. Albert has tons of energy and stamina. But he doesn't, as\nChurchill put it, 'keep going'. Instead, he keeps looking for pastures new - the\ngolden sunlit uplands, the philosopher Leibniz's 'best of all possible worlds'.\nPerhaps there, in a new place, he will find his fortune and change his luck?\nInstead, he immediately encounters the evils of an unfamiliar and\nperilous country, without the benefit of the road maps he so painstakingly\nput together in his last adventure. He does not 'keep on truckin\" as the\ncartoonist, Robert Crumb, would have it.\nThis 'flight not fight' behavioural trait is the sign of a prey animal, not a\npredator. Despite what you will read in many self-improvement tomes, 'part-\nnering' and 'symbiotic evolution' are no way to get rich. They may be a way\nto a better world. They may make you a happier person and a better\nmanager. But they will not make you rich - except, perhaps, in spirit.\nTo become rich you must behave as a predator. I will go further, you\nmust become a predator. Albert is not a predator.\nBy moving so adroitly and so swiftly from one thing to the next, Albert\ndoes not place himself in the way of luck. He does not draw luck to him. He\ndoes not make his own luck. He is much too much in love with the green,\ngreen grass just over the next hill.\nThen again, Albert is more intelligent than I am. He had a grand educa-\ntion and read all the right books at university. He is not a self-taught scholar,\nas I am. But there is a downside to all this intelligence and imagination. He\nthinks a little too much before he acts. He weighs the options too carefully.\nHe is capable of imagining defeat.,\nSo while he is clever enough to want to minimise his risk by switching to\nyet another new and uncontested marketplace, he leads himself into uncer-\ntainty. And into error.\nUncontested markets are usually uncontented for a reason. Nature\nabhors a vacuum and if no one else is contesting a market, it may well be that"

    "raw_text": "no such market exists. Albert is always slightly ahead of the media game. He\nis a visionary, I guess. Very few visionaries get rich, begging the lads at\nGoogle's pardon.\nNew software often faces this problem. Brilliant software designers come\nup with fancy software that solves no known problem. They are forced to\ndiscover or invent a problem their software might solve. Should they fail,\nthere will be no users and no investors. And no money.\nTake electronic spreadsheets, for example, today one of the most ubiq-\nuitous tools of any finance department anywhere in the world. Prior to the\ninvention of spreadsheets, nobody spent much time playing 'what if' games\nand mapping possible alternative financial business models. Today, every-\nbody does it as a matter of course.\nBut few visions or new technologies result in such a serendipitous\noutcome. Yet Albert wastes too much of his time seeking them out, coming\nto understand them and making all the rest of us feel inferior as he wearily\nexplains this exciting new concept for the umpteenth rime to Luddite\nchumps like me."

    "raw_text": "There are other differences between Albert and me. He is a great believer\nin partnering and share options and employee profit participation, I shall be\ndevoting an entire chapter to this subject (See Chapter 14; A Piece of the\nPie), but I will mention, here, that in Albert's case, this division of the spoils\nis undertaken in the minutest detail, long before there are any profits what-\never to share, Albert believes they encourage his co-workers. But such\narrangements are immensely time-consuming and a distraction from the\ntunnel vision necessary to become rich in the first place.\nAlbert is a ferocious negotiator, as I've mentioned, and a whizz at assim-\nilating and mastering detail. But he is a perfectionist and his powers of dele-\ngation are stunted. He's so good at what he does that he is unwilling to\naccept even slightly second-best. This means, for him, that he must do it\nhimself. And if by chance he doesn't get it exactly right the first rime, then\nhe will do it over and over again until it is right. Until it is perfect.\nWe shall come to the importance of delegation later in this book (See\nChapter 13: The Joys of Delegation), but Albert's reluctance to permit\nyoung managers to make their own mistakes has cost him dearly over the\nyears. Not just in the time wasted, but in management turnover.\nWhile he is fair, and sometimes more than fair, with his staff, they don't\nlove him. They don't love him because they do not get the chance to grow,\nand if there is one good thing about a well-managed company in a capitalist\nsociety, it is the opportunity to groom talent and encourage it to grow. Apart\nfrom the money, it's the best thing about getting rich.\nAs a result of trying to do everything himself, Albert also sometimes\nmisses out on good fortune and luck when it's staring him in the face. He\nreminds me of a groom-to-be who is so keen to redecorate the church, the\nreception rooms and his new house to ensure a perfect wedding day that he\nfails to notice his bride-to-be has grown tired of waiting and has married\nanother man.\nAlso, Albert cares too much (because he is growing desperate in his mid-\nfifties), and takes himself and his destiny too seriously. I know this because I\nhave got drunk with him a few times - always a good way to really get to\nknow somebody. In vain I have pointed out to him that we are nothing but\nmerchant princes. Who will give a hoot whether we made $10 million or\n$500 million in a hundred years from now? Nobody will.\nHaving too much money isn't important. Breaking your neck is impor-\ntant. Getting cancer is important. Having nothing to eat is important.\nLosing someone you love is important. But too much money is absolutely\n\f\nnot important, it's just a part of the game. As H. L. Mencken put it: 'The\nchief value of money lies in the tact that one lives in a world in which it is\noverestimated.'\nThat's a fair summary. If we lived in a world where seaweed was overes-\ntimated, I would collect tons and tons of it. And I would enjoy doing it.  \nBut\nI wouldn't kid myself it was all that important. It's just seaweed.\nBut Albert doesn't get it. He won't laugh at himself enough; he won't\ndance in the moonlight stark naked at a party for the hell of it; he won't sing\nthe words to 'Duke of Earl' or 'Doo-Doo-Ron-Ron' out loud when we've\nimbibed too much malt whisky - he doesn't even know the words to those\nsongs, for chrissake. He cares what people think about him. He cares about  \nhis\ngravitas. He can't empty his mind during negotiations, stare straight through\nan adversary and walk away from a table with millions of dollars piled on it.\nHow can I put this another way? Lady Luck doesn't love star-struck suit-\nors like Albert. She wants crazy bastards who will tell her to take a hike or\nget lost if they feel like it. She won't come calling to anyone who needs her\nor needs to worship her.\nIf Albert stopped trying to be lucky and just got on with the business of\nmaking loads-a-money; if he ignored the rotten cow even when she came\ncalling; if he cursed her out loud for every little favour she bestowed ... then\nwho knows? She's a fickle bitch at best and making nicey-nicey is one  \ncertain\nway never to get a piece of her.\nLastly, Albert has a penchant, and always did, for calling himself unlucky.\nHe's subtle in the way he does it, but he does it none the less. And he does\nit too often for my taste. You do not have to read Norman Vincent Peale's\nThe Power of Positive Thinking to know that if you repeat something nega-\ntive often enough, then you are training yourself in the ways of negativity.\nThe mask of misfortune Albert so ironically dons for the amusement of those\naround him fits rather too well these days. He is becoming the mask. It's a\ndangerous, stupid game and he ought to know better.\nMaybe he does know better. But unless he gets lucky, he will never be rich.\nNo one can pretend that luck - or chance, at least - does not exist: in\nlife, in love, in business and in the getting of money.

    "raw_text": "capital 'H', then you must also accept that life itself on this planet arrived by\nluck. You can't have it both ways.\n'Fortune favours the brave,' says the old proverb. And that's right\nenough. But it seems to especially scorn anyone who wants money too  \nbadly.\nAnd it positively appears to despise men or women who fear to lose what\nfortune they already have. As William Shakespeare put it in Othello:\nPoor and content is rich, and rich enough,\nBut riches fineless* is as poor as winter\nTo him that ever fears he shall be poor.\nMy advice concerning luck is to laugh in the face of the Lady when she pres-\nents herself. Take what you will of her bounty and act swiftly to take advan-\ntage of good fortune. But never thank her for it. And forget her the moment\nshe leaves to seek another victim.\nIn modern, sexist parlance: 'Treat her mean to keep her keen.' Pimp her,\ndon't court her. And don't go looking for her or make enquiries about her.\nIt isn't exactly the act of a gentleman, but then you didn't ask me to teach\nyou to be a gentleman.\nYou asked me to show you how to get rich.\nSo here are my last thoughts on this vexing and baffling phenomenon.\nO Prepare yourself for luck, but don't seek her out. Let her come to you.\nO Make your own luck.\nO Don't whine or ever describe yourself as 'unlucky'. (You're alive, aren't\nyou?)\nO Be bold. Be brave. Don't thank your lucky stars. The stars can't hear you.\nO Stay the course. Stop looking for the green grass over the hill.\nO  Don't try to do it all yourself. Delegate and teach others to delegate.\nO  Remember that most predators are lucky most of their lives, unlike their\nprey.\nO Whiners and cowards die a hundred times a day. Be a hero to yourself.\nO If being a hero isn't your style, then fake it. Reality will catch up eventually.\nQ Just do it. It is much easier to apologise than to obtain permission.\n\f\nO Never take the quest for wealth seriously. It's just a game, chum.\nO Next time you bump into Lady Luck, giver her a whack on the rump\nfrom me.\nO Be lucky. Get rich. Then give it all away. (We'll get to that bit later.)\nO Don't call your son 'Albert'. (Just joking!)\n \n* boundless, infinite\n\f\n1 1\nTHE ART OF\nNEGOTIATING\nThe fortress that parleys is already half taken.\nRUSSIAN PROVERB\nTHE BALANCE OF WEAKNESS\nReams of highfalutin nonsense have been spoken and published on the\nsubject of negotiating, especially by politicians. During John F, Kennedy's\nportentous inaugural speech, the new president exhorted his fellow coun-\ntrymen: 'Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negoti-\nate.'\nThis is typically muddled drinking from one of the most overrated pres-\nidents in US history, A good looker, but a bad egg.\nIf you 'negotiate out of fear' you are not 'negotiating'. You are surren-\ndering in all but name. As to the second half of his pronouncement, he is\nsaying that it's always worth listening to the other side in the search for\nmutually beneficial agreements. Did we need the world's most powerful man\nto tell us that? It's just common sense.\nNegotiating is a popular subject, too, in big fat books from US corpo-\nrate management pundits with tides like The Art of the Steal OR The Sun Tzu\nSplit Second Manager. It's amusing stuff, but has little to do with getting\nrich, except in the mind of  authors hoping to join the comfortably poor by\nwriting catchword tripe.\nSerious negotiations, however, have everything to do with getting rich.\nThis is both because a great negotiator can make a real difference in some\nsituations and because many people, astonishingly, believe themselves to be\ngreat negotiators. In my experience, the reality is somewhat more prosaic:\nQ Most of us are rather poor negotiators.\nO Most negotiations are unnecessary.\nJ 'The other side 1 is often just as smart (or stupid) as you are.\nO In the end, 'the balance of weakness' almost always decides the issue.\nO In Greed vs. Need, the former usually 'wins'."

    "raw_text": "All negotiations arise from weakness, unless you are one of that strange tribe\nwho finds themselves intoxicated with the process of bargaining and negoti-\nating itself. Sure, haggling can be fun, but it's only a means to an end as far\nas this book is concerned.\nIf you are overly fond of haggling, my advice is that you quit thinking\nabout making money the old-fashioned way and consider becoming a politi-\ncian instead. That way you can rob and plunder your fellow citizens year  \nafter\nyear without risking your own financial security or capital - you bastard. (By\nthe way, please get used to people thinking of you as a bastard. After all, it's\nwhat nearly everyone thinks of politicians, except themselves.)\nAs for us working stiffs, serious negotiating (just like turning to the law\nto dig you out of trouble), should be reserved for serious occasions. Most\n'negotiations' are not negotiations at all; they are merely part of the fabric of\neveryday living. The manner in which they are conducted will depend on the\nparties involved, the subject under discussion, your day-to-day management\nstyle and what side of the bed you got out of that morning.\nTake a small example. You have an employee who wishes to deposit and\ncollect their child from school each day. This will supposedly interfere with\nhis or her 'normal' working hours. Big deal.\nIf the employee is important to you, you will probably bend over back-\nwards to 'negotiate' a solution. If they are not, you will probably enforce the\nletter of the law applicable in the country or state in which you work, or\nmuddle through with your company's 'in-house rules'. (Personally, I'd \nallow\nthem to do it. But that's because I'm both an idle manager and a big  \nold\nsofty - in personnel matters, at least.)\nWhatever you decide to do, you are not involved in 'negotiating' - you\nare problem solving. The same applies to mid-level salary negotiations, most\nhuman-resource issues, job-title dickering, job-performance reviews and the\nprice of wet fish. Serious negotiations are like falling in love. You may have\nfooled around a few times and been strongly attracted to one or two lovers.\nBut when you fall in love, brothers and sisters, you will know all about it.\nRight off the bat. Boom! That's what serious negotiations are like. It's prob-\nably happened once or twice, right?\nMANAGEMENT BARGAINING VS SERIOUS NEGOTIATIONS"

    "raw_text": "Do not mistake serious negotiations with management bargaining. They\nrequire very different skills.\nAll great companies, all well-run organisations, need great managers and\ngreat staff. That much, at least, is pretty obvious. You forget it at your peril.\nBut the acquisition of managers who can bring a sense of mission to even\nmundane tasks, who can identify' potential candidates, nurture late bloomers,\nfire dullards and whiners and adapt to changing circumstances - that search-\ning, identifying and nurturing is not about negotiating. It's about setting an\nexample of true meritocracy in a company where nepotism hasn't a chance\nand where those who wish to succeed are given every opportunity and\nencouragement to do so. So far, so straightforward.\nSimilarly, all organisations are a reflection of the people who start them.\nThis sounds crazy, but history has shown it to be true. The effects of even\nlong-dead founders often linger for decades. I'm told by Hollywood film\nbuffs, for example, that MGM movies in the old days were normally slightly\nless 'dark' than Warner Bros movies. It was the 'house style', a style that had\nfiltered down from the original founders over the years and somehow\npervaded individual directors, producers and even actors at each studio.\nThe only 'style' I assume you're interested in developing is an efficient\nmoney-making machine which is also a great place to work. That's a wise and\nlaudable aim, but however necessary, however laudable, such aims are, they\nbelong in the realm of senior- and middle-management problem-\nsolving.\nPlease remember: you are not reading this book to become a successful\nmanager. Managers rarely become rich. Most managers are lieutenants. \nYou,\non the other hand, have to keep you eye on another ball - several other \nballs,\nin fact.\nYou may well have to masquerade as a manager (for a short while) on the\nway to becoming rich, and you should strive to be a good manager while \nthe\nrole is forced upon you. But even if you discover that you truly have a \ntalent\nfor the minutiae that management: demands, it's best to abandon the  \nrole\njust as soon as you can afford to hire appropriate personnel.\n\f\nYou just will not have the time to choose who gets to work in which\noffice, where the Christmas party should be held or what company  \npolicy\nshould be regarding the provision of in-house tea and coffee facilities. If, \nas\nthe owner, you do find you have the time to involve yourself in such \ndeci-\nsions, then I have news for you. Your organisation is in deep trouble.\nPersonally, I don't think I was a very good managing director or CEO of\nany of my companies, so my advice concerning your choice of middle \nmanage-\nment is limited to the following: the world is full of aspiring lieutenants. \nMost\npeople seek job security, job satisfaction and power over others far more \nthan\nthey seek wealth. And thank goodness for that. If all the great managers \nin the\nworld were dead set on becoming rich, and willing to take the necessary \nrisks\nto do so, there would be little hope for the likes of you and me.\nManagement efficiency really does count, of course: loyalty counts, fair-\nness counts, a steady disposition counts, a sense of appropriate \ncompromise\ncounts. An organisation will fail without managers who apply such \nvirtues\nconsistently. But they are not necessarily attributes you should invite \ninto the\nroom during a series of tough negotiations when the big money is on  \nthe\ntable and your future is on the line. They are the attributes of first-class\nmanagers. Not negotiators.\nSerious negotiations are very different from day-to-day bargaining and\nshould be approached differently. They imply a weakness in the position \nof at\nleast one of the parties involved in the negotiations, unlike day-to-day\nbargaining, where no such weakness need exist. The first thing to be \ndone,\nperhaps the most vital thing, is to establish exactly where those \nweaknesses lie.\n\f\nWeaknesses in serious negotiations usually exist in both camps, of course,\nat least to some degree or another, and it becomes important to swiftly\ndetermine which weakness is most pressing and roost potentially  \ncatastrophic\nto which party. An immediate balance of weaknesses may well prove more\ndecisive than any long-term balance of strengths.\nIt is for this reason that small companies and individuals have sometimes\nmanaged to out-negotiate larger rivals, especially in emerging markets and\ntechnologies. If a big, powerful organisation convinces itself it absolutely  \nhas\nto have some whizzo new technology, or whatever, it will sometimes permit\nitself to pay way over the odds for it. We've seen it a zillion times reported\nin the financial press.\nThe balance of weakness is also the reason why farmers in Britain, for\nexample, are utterly in thrall to the power of the supermarket chains and why\nBritish people pay more for much of their food than almost anywhere else in\nEurope. British food isn't better (in fact, it is somewhat worse than in a\ncountry such as France), but British supermarkets are undisputed champions\nwhen it comes to exploiting the balance of weakness.\nFarmers are poor negotiators. Supermarket chains are great negotiators.\nSupermarkets have a lot of cash and many possible sources of supply.  \nFarmers\nneed to fix that broken tractor and pay their veterinary bills right now. The\nbalance of weakness is overwhelmingly in the farmers' camp and the result is\ntherefore preordained unless central government interferes.\nSupermarkets have a slight weakness - very slight. They need to buy food\nregularly and in wholesale quantities. And they need quality and consistency.\nIf food became scarce, the balance would tilt and farmers would begin to\nclobber the supermarkets. But, right now, farmers haven't a prayer. There is\ntoo much food of reasonable quality too consistently available from too\nmany sources and our government has chosen not to interfere.\n(The rights and wrongs of all this are immaterial. If I could arrange the\nmagazine publishing and internet website business the way British super-\nmarkets have arranged their business, I would do it in a heartbeat.  \nProviding\nI was a supermarket and not a farmer.)\nOr take the attitude of banks towards start-up or small companies. If you\nneed a loan because you cannot meet payroll, you almost certainly won't get\n\f\none. (Er, make that 'you absolutely, definitely won't get one'.) The balance\nof weakness is so obvious and utterly immediate, nobody will want to waste\ntime listening to your entreaties.\nBut if you need a loan, say, because you wish to take a private company\npublic with a reasonable chance of success in the not-too-distant future (in\nother words, you don't really need a loan, it would merely be convenient to\nbe offered one), then loans will shower upon you like confetti. After all,\nbanks need to make money by selling professional services as well as charg-\ning interest, and you are now a potentially important customer, a customer\nwho may well require those professional services - not a supplicant grovel-\nling on his knees with a dog-eared business plan.\nTHE ELEPHANT AND THE FLEA\nIf all this sounds to you as if the controllers of capital are the 10 ton\nelephants in the jungle, then you're right. But there is another side to it.\nYour little outfit may be nothing but a flea in a corporate elephant's patch of\njungle, indeed one he has barely noticed until recently, but just how much\nmight the elephant be willing to pay to be rid of you, or to buy you out?\nEspecially if your business, however small, is growing and the elephant's\nbusiness is not?\nBecause the elephant has a master, a mahout. And his master is an unfor-\ngiving son-of-a-bitch with a nasty barbed iron stick and an elephant gun. He\nis otherwise known as an institutional investor. All start-up entrepreneurs\nshould say their prayers for institutional investors, those fabulous beasts,\nevery night. 'Dear Lord, thank you, thank yon for institutional investors in\nbig companies.'\nAn institutional investor, often a pension or savings company, is just jargon\nfor an entity that owns a big chunk of stock in a publicly traded company.\nSo why? Why should you say your prayers for them? What do institutional\ninvestors in huge corporations have to do with developing serious negotiating\nskills as an entrepreneur and getting rich? Everything, my friend. Everything.\nFor the elephant must show his master that he is an up-to-date elephant.\nA savvy elephant. An elephant that knows what's just round the corner and\nwhat the next big thing is going to be in his patch of jungle. Otherwise he\nrisks his share price dropping and being hurt by the nasty iron stick, or even\nshot by the fierce institutional investor, who will then acquire a  new\nelephant, leaving the bones of the old one to rot on the jungle floor.\n\f\nNOW YOU have had an idea. You have nurtured it with your little company\nand it is now a reality, however tiny. Better still, it looks like it's already  \nwork-\ning, or might work soon. The elephant is concerned that his master may hear\nof this little flea's idea and that he might well be punished for not having\nthought of it himself. (Most elephants are a trifle lazy, you know.) The\nelephant knows what he must do then. He lumbers over to meet you. He\nhas done it many times before, with many other fleas.\nThus it is that the elephant comes to the flea - not because he wants to\n(in his monstrous, corporate heart he would really like everything to stay\nthe same), but usually because he fears his mahout more than he despises\nthe flea. And sometimes, too, to be fair, because elephants are as curious as\nthe rest of us.\nBut never forget why he came calling in the first place. He does not love\nyou. He is not your friend, although he may pretend to be. He might not\nhate you, he may even admire you a little. He will certainly flatter you. But\nremember he had to come. His fear drove him. His fear of his master, the\ninstitutional investor.\nAnd the day when he does come - hurrah! - the day when he makes that\nhateful call - hateful to him, that is - that is the day when the fun begins and\nwhen serious negotiating skills and a dispassionate understanding of the\nbalance of weaknesses in your particular patch of jungle, at that particular\ntime, can change your life overnight. And can change it for ever. Just as it\nchanged mine.\nLet's look at a couple of examples of the elephant coming to the flea. (Of\ncourse, sometimes the flea must approach the elephant. Not so good. We'll\ncome to it later.)\nTHE ELEPHANT MISJUDGES HIS NEED\nAre you sitting comfortably, children? Then I'll begin.\nIt is 1981. Personal computers are a new thing in the world. They are\nnot the everyday objects we now take for granted. They have little presence\ninside the offices of any sensible company, large or small, except in those\ncompanies helping to create them, or the software for them - and those very\nfew companies publishing specialist magazines about them.\nDennis Publishing Ltd is just such a small specialist magazine publishing\ncompany, with a turnover of a few million pounds in Britain and a slippery\ntoehold in die USA. Its finances are precarious. Its owner is a  greedy little"

    "raw_text": "flea, determined never to be sent back to prison and never to report to\nanother human being in his life.\nThe flea has managed to acquire a controlling interest in Europe's first\npersonal computer magazine from the man who launched it, Angelo  \nZgorelec.\nThe magazine is called Personal Computer World, or PCW for short. It is not\nexactly a big magazine. Angelo and the flea have also helped to build up a \nseries\nof exhibitions allowing hardware and software manufacturers to show off  \ntheir\nlatest products. All this helps to boost sales and credibility for PCW.\nThe flea's company has done its best to staff PCW with good editors and\nwriters. This is an easier task than usual, because there are so few rival maga-\nzines. The magazine also has a first-class designer and one or two very\nhungry advertising sales people. While it's not exactly living off the fat of  \nthe\nland, PCW is an exciting place to work. The industry it reports on is a new,\nexciting industry. There is a whiff of revolution in the air, a technological\nrevolution. PCW is right at the heart of it and the staff and owners know  \nthat\nperfectly well.\nOther magazine fleas have begun to take notice. They launch their own\npersonal computer magazines. But they do not invest in them sufficiently  \nand\nthey are not quite as good as PCW. In time, the majority of them shut down\nor wither on the vine. The flea redoubles his efforts to obtain cash by publish-\ning rubbish one-shot magazines about pop music and panda bears. He pours\nthis cash into PCW. Without question, this decision to invest is the second or\nthird most important business decision the flea will ever make in his life.\nAbove all, the flea and his magazine are swimming with the tide, not\nagainst it, PCW is growing with the market. More readers come on board\nevery issue. And more advertising begins to arrive. A lot more advertising.\nAngelo Zgorelec and the flea are both immensely proud of themselves.\nThen disaster strikes. The flea has foolishly launched a pop-music weekly.\nHe has begun to believe he walks on water. This weekly is an initial success \nand\nthen a dreadful, cash-devouring failure. The flea is in panic and even  \nentertains\nthe idea of selling half of his little company to friendly partners - 'white\n\f\nknights' they are called in business jargon. Fortunately, this deal falls through,\nbecause his partners want him to close the pop-music weekly immediately and\nthe flea hasn't the courage or the wit to do so. When the 'white knights' walk\naway, catastrophe stares the flea's company in the face. There is simply not\nenough cash being generated to feed the growing monster called PCW.\nThe flea closes the pop-music weekly. He is forced to. By sheer, dumb luck,\nhis intransigence has kept him from selling half of his company's shares. But \nthe\ncash deficiency is looming still. And you must remember that the flea is still a\ngreedy littlc mite and wishes to become a millionaire at the earliest \nopportunity.\nHe is approached by a tall, affable man who, together with his sidekick,\nhas helped to build EMAP (East Midlands Allied Press), one of the biggest\nmagazine elephants in Britain. His name is David. David and the flea have\nmany meetings, later, David and his sidekick, Robin, will become good\nfriends with the flea. But this is not a time for friendship. This is a time for\nserious negotiations.\nDavid and Robin are a legend in the magazine jungle. They are polar\nopposites in character and appearance. David is sophisticated, slim, very tall,\nfriendly and non -threatening. You can tell he went to university without  \neven\nasking. He would have made a first-class diplomat. He is wise in the ways of\nprising properties from fleas. I think the first time I ever drank a decent\nbottle of wine was with David.\nRobin is cranky, hugely talented, sometimes bad-tempered; he does not\nsuffer fools gladly but he knows the magazine business backwards and is\nimmensely respected by the EMAP elephant employees. He has no time for\nmeals in restaurants and buttering up clients - or fleas for that matter, I don't\nlike him when I meet him. (I will get to like him very much in the years to\ncome.) David senses this and keeps Robin out of the picture.\nDavid and the flea arm-wrestie over the possible sale of PCW to EMAP.\nThe flea speaks to tax advisors, to Angelo and to lawyers. He speaks to his\nwhite-knight partners in America. The negotiations intensify and the flea\nrealises that David, while as calm as ever on the outside, is becoming anxious\nto close the deal swiftly. There is a particular meeting in the flea's flat in\ncentral London. Very, very nearly David persuades the flea that he must sell\nPCW now; that he must shake hands on a price of £700,000 or thereabouts.\nThis is an astonishing price for a new magazine.

    "raw_text": "very, very greedy.\nBut just as dumb luck saved the flea before, instinct saves him now.\nInstinct and the advice of the white knights and others. Besides, there is a\nslightly glittery cast to the elephant manager's eyes the flea doesn't much\ncare for at this meeting. He asks for more, much to David's annoyance, and\nthis time, understandably, that annoyance is openly expressed.\nFor a few weeks, the flea wonders if he hasn't allowed his greed and\nnaivety to wreck his salvation. Perhaps he had pushed the elephant too far?\nCertainly there are those around him who hold precisely that view. But what\nhas actually happened is that the EMAP elephant's managers have been talk-\ning to other fleas. They think they can obtain something rather similar to\nPCW for less than the £1 million the flea is asking for.\nJust for once, the EMAP elephant has misjudged the balance of weakness\nand has underestimated his need. It is an error for which he will pay dearly\nin the years to come. For within a short time, the flea will sell PCW, but not\nfor £700,000, not by a long chalk. What follows is the story of how he came\nto sell it and how much for.\nANOTHER ELEPHANT COMES TO CALL\nThere is more than one elephant in any jungle. Which is just as well. Fleas\nstand little chance when there is only one elephant - monopolies and entre-\npreneurs don't get along.\nSoon after the fateful meeting in the flea's flat with David, another\nelephant comes to call. This is a Dutch elephant called VNU, with homes all\nover Europe, It is a massive beast with a lot of experience in all kinds of\nmagazine publishing. In the UK, it has a large business-to-business opera-\ntion, including magazines serving large, traditional, mini-computer and\nmainframe computer departments.\nThe usual preamble and mating rites take place. The flea is coming to\nenjoy lunches in fancy restaurants and bottles of good wine - especially when\nhe is not paying for them. But the flea has also learned to shrug off flattery\nand keep his eye on the balance of weakness. This particular elephant has a\nhuge need, almost a unique need, and the flea is determined to exploit it.\nThe flea suspects that big computer installations will always be around.\nBut personal computers, desktop PCs as they will come to be known, are\nthe coming thing. They are a different kettle of fish entirely from main-\nframes and systems that require men in white coats and machines the size\nof a small room. The Dutch elephant's mahout will be especially angry if\n\f\nthe old beast misses out on the coming thing, the desktop PC. That is his\nunique weakness. And he is such a big elephant. And his mahout is such a\nterribly fierce master.\nNaturally the flea also has a weakness, one we already know about. He\n/ *\nis very short on cash and is greedy. Can the flea survive his cash shortfall and\ncurb his youthful greediness for long enough? Long enough for what, you\nask, children?\nLong enough to make the Dutch elephant become truly, truly desperate.\nCan he do it?\nThis is the flea's plan. His professional advisors hate the plan. It is stupid.\nA flea cannot outwait an elephant! But it can, you know; for a little while it\ncan. And all the time the flea's magazine is swimming with the ride, grow-\ning bigger each issue and increasing its advertising revenues. The flea even\nlicenses an Australian edition of PCW to a young man who strolls into his\noffice while on vacation. (A young man who will subsequently become a\nmillionaire as a result.) All the while the market is growing. And the Dutch\nelephant's mahout is not getting any happier.\nThe Dutch elephant's first offer is perfectly reasonable. It is made over\nlunch by a very nice Dutchman called Francis. \"We can offer you a million\npounds,' he says, peering over his spectacles. The flea stares him in the eye\nand says nothing. 'And a little more. Say £200,000, which we will hold in\nreserve and pay to you depending upon the performance of PCW over the\nnext year or so.'\nThis is a handsome offer. Almost twice the EMAP elephant's offer. But\nthe flea judges that the Dutch elephant is not desperate enough. Very\npolitely he declines and pours himself another glass of delicious wine.\nFrancis, wisely, let's the matter drop. He is an older man, and a skilled, cour-\nteous negotiator.\nSome weeks later, the Dutch elephant brings along another of his\nmanagers. This one is British and his name is Graeme. The flea likes him\nimmediately. But he is careful to mask his likes and dislikes. These managers\nare not here to be liked or not to be liked. They are here to negotiate and to\nrob the flea if they can. That is what they are paid for, after all. That is what\ntheir mahouts expect.\nA big meeting is held in the Dutch elephant's palatial offices. The flea has\n\f\nwith him only his lawyer, called Michael. Prior to this meeting, the Dutch\nelephant has tried to send an emissary to talk to Angelo Zgorelec, the minor-\nity shareholder in PCW. The flea is angry about that. There can only be one\nnegotiator. Any house divided is a house that will fall.\nThe flea has asked Angelo not to listen to the Dutch elephant's minions,\nand Angelo has willingly agreed. The flea masks his anger at the meeting.\nThis is a big day. He knows it will not be the day, for the Dutch elephant is\nstill not desperate enough. But it's a big day, all the same.\nThe flea has warned his lawyer, Michael, to keep all their business papers\nclose to hand. To be ready for an abrupt and immediate departure. Michael\nis unhappy about this. He is a canny, considerate man, and he is the flea's\nfriend. But he is not a negotiator and the flea is his client. He will do what\nis asked of him. That's why he is a professional.\nAround the table there are several managers from the Dutch elephant.\nAnd maybe a lawyer or an accountant or two, it's difficult to tell. The meet-\ning begins and a new offer is made. The offer is almost exactly what the flea\nhas guessed it would be: nearly two million pounds, with a big chunk held\n'in reserve'. It is a magnificent offer. Absolutely magnificent. Three times\nwhat was offered by the EMAP elephant.\nFor a while the flea does not respond. Instead, he talks about how well\nthe magazine is doing, about the Australian edition, about the growth of the\nexhibitions. He also mentions that he will be launching at least one more\npersonal computer magazine quite soon - one aimed at the personal\ncomputer trade itself this time. At companies who sell personal computers\nand personal computer software. It will be a business-to-business magazine,\nprecisely the type of magazine the Dutch elephant specialises in.\nEventually, the discussion comes back to the offer. The flea looks Graeme\nand Francis in the eye. He totally ignores everyone else present. He empties\nhimself mentally and stares straight through them. He convinces himself that\nhe does not care what the outcome of these negotiations will be. He clings\nto this illusion of emptiness while he negotiates. He doesn't care if he\nbecomes a millionaire or not.\n'The price is three million pounds,' he says, 'and only one twelfth can be\nheld in reserve. That is the price and it will not be changed.'\nThere is consternation around the table, whether real or feigned it is\ndifficult to say. The flea nods to his lawyer, who collects his papers and puts\nthem in his briefcase. They both rise to leave. Just as they are leaving the flea\n\f\nstares once again at the two Dutch elephant managers, his mind and eyes as\nblank as a zombie.\n'Thank you for your offer, gentlemen,' he says. 'As I said, the price is\nthree million pounds with only a quarter of a million pounds held in escrow.\nIn addition, the buyer of Personal Computer World must permit me to launch\nmy new computer magazine to the trade. If I do not hear from you shortly,\nthen my next price will be four million pounds. Good afternoon.'\nWe walked out into the Soho sunshine and stopped at local cafe. My\nhands were shaking as I spooned in the sugar. So were Michael's.\n'You're mad, my friend,' he murmured, shaking his head. 'Utterly mad.\nWorse than that, you have been stupid. They will not pay that kind of money.\nAlso, you have walked out on them, you have threatened them and you have\nmade a sudden, unreasonable demand. Are you really planning to launch a\nPC trade magazine?'\n'No,' I admitted. 'I only just thought of it while I was sitting there. I\nhaven't got the money to launch anything. You know that.'\nWe both sat sipping our coffee, Michael smoking one of his small cigars\nfrom a tin. Ironically, they were Dutch cigars. I paid the bill, and while the\nwaitress was bringing my change, Michael tried one last time to persuade me\nto do the sensible thing, 'Felix, I am your lawyer and your friend. Let me go\nback and apologise. Two million pounds is an unbelievable sum of money. I\ndon't know of any new magazine that has ever sold for two million pounds\nin Britain. Listen to me and let me go back. You don't have to go yourself.'\nAnd I very nearly allowed Michael to do just that. But something held\nme back. Something I had sensed but could not explain or articulate. Finally,\nI smiled a little ruefully and patted Michael's arm: 'Michael, their need will\noutweigh my greed. I am sure of it. Let's wait and see.'\nSo we waited.\nBefore we bring the story to its conclusion, let us pause and reflect on\nwhat has happened here.\nO The flea has established to his own satisfaction the elephant's urgent  \nneed.\nO  The flea has learned to ignore flattery.\nO The flea has learned that an elephant cannot be your friend in negotiations.\nO The flea has learned he is not a good negotiator."

    "raw_text": "O The flea has learned to 'empty' himself and make himself believe he docs\nnot care.\nO The flea has overcome his lack of skill by setting a price he will not devi-\nate from.\nO The flea has hardened his heart and has walked away when the price was\nnot met.\nO The flea has introduced a rogue element (the trade magazine) into the\nnegotiations.\nO The flea has weighed Greed vs. Need. He believes Need will outweigh\nGreed.\nOf course, you know the end of the story. We all met again round the big\ntable, this time with a lot more accountants and a lot more lawyers. The price\nagreed was three million pounds. The escrow was a quarter of a million\npounds. Angelo got his million pounds. My company got the rest. I got to\nlaunch my trade magazine, called Microscope, which kept me in the loop  \nof\na new and growing market but out of VNU's way - for a while.\nAnd what did the Dutch elephant get? It got a wonderful magazine\nwhich is still being published and which still makes money today, twenty-\nfour\nyears later. They also persuaded me to help launch two more personal\ncomputer magazines for them, one in the UK, which was a flop, and one in\nHolland, which was a success.\nLastly, and very cleverly, VNU kept me out of the personal computer\nmarket (except for my trade magazine) for three years. Three vital years.\nThey did that with a non-compete clause in the sale agreement. (Non-\ncompete clauses can be a bugger for those selling an asset. Keep the period\nof non-compete as short as you can.)\nAnd what of EMAP, the first elephant who had come calling? EMAP\nnever really succeeded in the personal computer magazine business. Not\nin PCWs patch of the jungle. In virtually every other sector they reigned\n(and continue to reign) supreme. They have whipped my butt time and\ntime again in other sectors. But they missed their chance with PCW. They\nunderestimated their need and were, probably rightly, appalled by this little\nflea's greed.\n\f\nNot that I blame them. I've been on the receiving end as a buyer, rather\nthan a seller, too often now to blame them even remotely. But it was still an\nerror. Had David tipped the ante to one million pounds or more in my Soho\nflat, my greed would probably have overwhelmed me, and Angelo and I\nwould have missed out on an additional two million pounds.\nIn today's figures, by the way, that two million pounds would he worth\nabout six million pounds, give or take. That's a huge chunk of change to\nwaste through making a mistake in negotiations.\nA FEW TIPS ON NEGOTIATING\nO Remember that few of us are any good at detailed negotiations. That\nincludes your opponent, by the way.\nO If you ara a poor negotiator, like me, then set a limit on what you will\npay or accept and on any conditions attached. Do not deviate. Your first\nthought is your best thought.\nO Most negotiations are unnecessary. Don't enter into them. Remember\nthat 'the fortress that parleys is already half taken'. Save serious negotia-\ntions for serious occasions.\nO Do your homework. And do it rigorously. What you don't know or\nhaven't bothered to find out can kill you in any type of serious negotiation.\nO Despite my jungle book examples above, the devil really is in the detail\nin serious negotiations. Get all the professional help you can trust. But\ndo not surrender control of the negotiations or the agenda to such\nprofessionals. They are not the ones who will have to live with the conse-\nquences - you are. Professional advisors are there to explain and advise.\nnot to decide.\nO If your advisors are leading you down a path you don't approve of during\nyour negotiations, call a 'time out' and tell them privately that if they\ncontinue down that path you will get yourself some new advisors. The\nworld is full of them.\nO Never fall in love with the deal. A deal is just a deal. There will always be\nother deals and other opportunities.\nO Avoid auctions in business like the plague - unless you are selling some-\nthing, that is. You will nearly always pay more than was wise if you are\nthe 'winner' of an auction process.\nO The negotiator opposite you is not your new best friend. He is not your\n\f\npartner. He is not your confidant. You have no obligation, outside of\nordinary courtesy, to please him or satisfy his demands. He is the enemy.\nIf you do not understand that real winners and real losers emerge from\nserious negotiations then you will be robbed, whatever the circumstances.\nO Take no notice of management manuals that tell you to leave passion and\nemotion out of the negotiating room. If you are emotional or passionate\nabout something, then let it show. But leaven emotion with courtesy,\nand, if possible, with wit. If you're not the witty type, then flattery and\nself-deprecation are good substitutes.\nO Listen when engaged in serious negotiations. Then listen some more. You\nare in no hurry. Nobody ever got poor listening. Also, use silence as a\nweapon. Silences are disconcerting. People tend to fill silences with\njabber, often weakening their bargaining position as they do so.\nO Choose a rogue element to your advantage and bring it into the nego-\ntiation at a late stage. You'll be amazed at how often this tactic\nproduces results.\nO The British created the largest geophysical empire in the world with one\ntactic: divide and rule. It always works. It never fails if you can get to\nexploit it. Get to know the other side. There may be slight differences in\nthe individual approaches of their senior managers and, possibly, in their\ngoals. Drive a wedge and keep hammering.\nO Permit no such weaknesses in your own camp, I have often banned\nsenior executives from taking part in negotiations simply to avoid this\ntrap. Better you are in there on your own, outgunned, outflanked and\noutmanoeuvred, than to have two or three of you silently squabbling.\nO Everyone thinks they are a great negotiator, but most of us simply are not.\nIf it's your company, then, for better or worse, you are the final arbiter.\nThat remains true whether you are a good negotiator or a had one.\nO If you suspect you perform badly on such occasions, do not attend, even if\nyou are the 100 per cent owner. Get someone else to do it after setting out\nyour response to every conceivable option that might arise. This tactic can\nbe devastating to the other side, and Peter, Bob and I have used it on many\noccasions in the past. You have to completely trust your nominee, though.\nQ Above all, establish where the balance of weakness lies in any serious\nnegotiation. Most strengths are self-evident, especially strengths like cash\nand infrastructure. Weaknesses are usually hidden. Ferret them out, hold\nthem up to the fight and make a battle plan."

    "raw_text": "O Whatever you agree to during a negotiation, fulfil the bargain. Nobody\nwants to do business with a weasel or a chisler. Written in the Zoroastrian\nScriptures two-and-a-half thousand years ago was this: 'Never break a\ncovenant, whether you make it with a false man or a just man of good\nconscience. The covenant holds for both, the false and the just alike.'\nAye, that it does.\nI will leave you on this subject with the words of Britain's closest rival to\nMachiavelli: Francis Bacon. Bacon 'negotiated' his way from relative poverty\nto the very pinnacle of wealth and power in England under King James I.\nThen lost it all, and spent his last years writing and studying. His Essays are\namong the wisest, most thought-provoking (and meanest) set of instructions\never published in English, I sleep with them by my bedside.\nThis is from a short essay (short even by Bacon's standards) entitled 'Of\nNegotiating', published in 1625, nearly four hundred years ago. Every word\nof it is true today:\nIf you would work (negotiate with) any man, you must either know his\nnature and fashions, and so lead him; or his ends, and so persuade him;\nor his weakness or disadvantages, and so awe him; or those that have an\ninterest in him, and so govern him. In dealing with cunning persons, we\nmust ever consider their ends to interpret their speeches; and it is good to\nsay little to them, and that which they least look for. In all negotiations\nof difficulty, a man may not took to sow and reap at once; but must\nprepare business, and so ripen it by degrees.\nThank goodness Francis Bacon did not live in my time and go into the\nBritish magazine business. I would never have got rich with such a rival in\nthe same city!"

If we do not own the freshness\nof the air and the sparkle of the water, how can you buy them?\nCHIEF SEATTLE, NINETEENTH-CENTURY AMERICAN INDIAN  \nCHIEF OF THE SUQUAMISH\nPrivate property began the instant somebody had a mind of his own.\nEDWARD  E. CUMMINGS , AMERICAN  POET\nTHE PARADOX OF OWNERSHIP\nHow can anyone truly 'own' anything? Surely the answer is that we can claim\nno such thing.\nNo animal but man lays claim to owning things or places. They merely\ndefend them - their lives, their mate, their cubs, their pack, their territory,\ntheir food. If you introduce a new dog or cat into a household which\nalready contains one or two of these excellent creatures, there will be a\nshort, trying period of testing the waters and perhaps a scuffle or two, and\nthe thing is done.\nA new animal soon finds its place in the collective hierarchy easily\nenough. And it requires no parliament, written laws, police force, bailiff or\narmy to do so.\nHuman beings are different. We purport to believe that individuals can\n'own' the most astonishing things; that they can own islands, mines, moun-\ntains, forests and areas of the sea. Even more astonishingly we pretend that\nmere names can own such things, for what is a partnership, a corporation or\na country but a name?\nAnd to top it all, we believe that a name can own an executed idea - for\nthat is the basis of corporate intellectual ownership. The very type of owner-\nship that has been the foundation of my own wealth.\nPerhaps even more preposterous is the universally accepted proposition\nthat an individual or entity can 'own' land, rivers, hills and deserts where\n\f\ndinosaurs freely roamed for uncounted millennia. Roamed, mark you, long\nbefore Homo sapiens sapiens was a twinkle in a small, shrew-like mammal's\neye. Not to mention that those lands, hills, rivers and deserts will be there\nwhen not even a whisper of evidence survives to show that humans existed\non the blue planet.\nThis is not a book about philosophy, sociology or the history of human\nlaw, but I believe it is worth remembering that ownership of any kind is\nnonsensical. It is absurd and defies reason because we are all mortal and we\ncannot (as yet) take it with us.\nSo what's this got to do with getting rich? I could say, 'Nothing, but\nthank you for letting me get it off my chest'; but I won't say that, because\nmy amateurish musings illustrate very nicely just how idiotic the getting of\nwealth, as a goal in and of itself, really is.\n'Ah,' but you could argue, 'that's all very well for you. You have already\nmade your pile. It's easy to be philosophical when you've already amassed a\nfortune.' And my reply would be that there is truth in that, but there is also\ntruth in the assertion that I may well have been only able to put a few\nhundred minion dollars in the bank because I recognised that this getting\nrich malarkey is just a game. A delusion, if you will.\nBeing rich is fine, and at the very least is better than being poor. But it\nshouldn't be the be-all and end-all of your life, or anyone's life. If you can\nlaugh in the midst of early poverty and in the face of real adversity, and if you\ncan still laugh when you're coining it in, then you will almost certainly\ncontinue to coin it in.\nBut if you chase money desperately in the earnest belief that you can never\nbe happy without it and seriously think that the chase is a meaningful occupa-\ntion, I doubt very much you will succeed. You have to be fiercely determined,\ntrue. But an appreciation of the absurdity of the chase helps enormously.\nAs the author G. K. Chesterton puts it in one of his Father Brown\nstories: 'To be clever enough to get all that money, one must be stupid\nenough to want it.' Mind you, Chesterton wasn't exactly averse to fine food\nand wine himself.\nOK, OK, enough musing. Now we'll get on with the job of stimulating\nyour accumulation of money as quickly as possible. But don't say your  \nUncle\nFelix didn't warn you.\nWHY OWNERSHIP ISN'T THE IMPORTANT THING -"

    "raw_text": "IT'S THE ONLY THING\nA poor virgin, sir, an ill-favoured thing, sir, but mine own.\nWILLIAM  SHAKESPEARE , As YOU LIKE IT\nSo if ownership is a delusion, and we are all nothing more than consenting\nthieves, how can we become successful thieves as early as possible? The\nanswer is simple. Very simple, and if you want to be rich then I ask you to\nstop skipping paragraphs and pay close attention.\nTo become rich you must be an owner. And you must try to own it all.\nYou must strive with every fibre of your being, while recognising the idiocy\nof your behaviour, to own and retain control of as near to 100 per cent of\nany company as you can. If that is not possible, in a public company, for\nexample, then you must be prepared to make yourself hated by those\naround you who are also trying to be rich. That is the dirty, rotten little\nsecret of it all, my friend. Just like Gollum, it is your Precious and they are\nall 'filthy little thieves'.\nYou won't read that in any of those Become An Instant Millionaire In\nYour Sleep manuals I mentioned earlier. Such works, nearly all written by\nmen and women who have never made a million anything in their lives,\nusually witter on about becoming a better manager (who bloody cares about\nbecoming a better manager?) or creating 'partnerships', thinking 'outside\nthe box' and exploiting 'insanely great' ideas in totally innovative ways.\nTo put it bluntly, this is all bollocks. It has nothing to do with becom-\ning rich.\nTo become rich, every single percentage point of anything you own is\ncrucial. It is worth fighting for, tooth and claw. It is worth suing for. It is\nworth shouting and banging on the table for. It is worth begging for and\ngrovelling for. It is worth lying and cheating for. In extremis, it is even  \nworth\nnegotiating for.\nNever, never, never, never hand over a single share of anything you have\nacquired or created if you can help it. Nothing. Not one share. To no one.\nNo matter what the reason - unless you genuinely have to.\nDo you remember my old 'rivals' Robin and David from the EMAP\nelephant? They were both far better publishers than I will ever be. On my\nbest day they would have wiped the floor with me. But after a quarter of a\ncentury of jointly creating one of the biggest media companies in Britain for\nEMAP shareholders, what did they get for their pains?\n\f\nI don't know exactly, of course, and I wouldn't tell you if I did. But I'll\nguess, using current market norms. £3 million? £5 million? £10 million? (I\ndoubt the last, but it could have been.) You mean that's it? That's all there\nis after busting your balls for the best part of your working life and making\nhundreds of shareholders and lawyers and banks immensely rich? A few\nmeasly million pounds less tax? That's shocking.\nI've made more than that in deals I can barely remember now. I once\nmade half a million by selling a magazine I had not even published yet to a\nrival. Half a million pounds for a day's work. And why? Why? Why?\nBecause I owned it. I owned it all. And my dear friends David and Robin\nnever owned anything during their time there except for a pile of EMAP\nshare options, a good salary and a lovely pension. Please think about this if\nyou want to be rich. Ownership is not the most important thing. IT IS THE\nONLY THING THAT COUNTS.\nNothing else counts in the getting of money. Shareholder thanks do not\ncount. A good salary and a company car and health plan and pension don't\ncount. Most-share options (usually nothing more than the promise of chick -\nenfeed to salaried employees, and a promise broken half the time, too), don't\ncount. The gratitude of colleagues doesn't count.\nNothing counts but what you own in the race to get rich. If you haven't\nmuch skill, or much wit, or much talent, or much luck, and yet you insist on\nowning more than your fair share of any start-up or acquisition, then you can\nbecome rich. If you take what you're given, you will probably not get rich.\nYears ago, in the early days of my company, four of my colleagues got\ntogether and had a long talk, I assume in a pub, although I cannot be sure\nof that. One was a senior manager, one was a publisher, one was a designer\nand the other an editor. Together, they hatched a small conspiracy. Knowing\nhow important they were to my little company, they confronted me and\ndemanded a share. They bearded the lion in his lair.\nThey were polite and civilised about it. They pointed out that I owned\n100 per cent of the company and could easily afford to share out, say, 20 per\ncent between them. It wouldn't cost me anything and it was only fair. Those\nwere the words they used. They were working just as many hours (10-12\nhours on a good day) as I was and they were committed to making the\ncompany a huge success. They were even willing to discuss a slight reduction\nin their salaries in return.\nIn addition, they went on, I should remember that such a 'dispersal' (I\nremember they actually used that word, too) would incentivise them might-\n\f\nily. Such a gesture would never be forgotten. And my remaining 80 per cent\nof the company would ensure that I was still the boss.\nHowever, should I not 'disperse' these shares among them, they\nintended to leave. And leave immediately, virtually without notice. They\nwould have no option but to do so, although they didn't want to.\nThe company would suffer dreadfully - and might even fail altogether.\nThey had already agreed the name of their new company, in case I wouldn't\nplay ball, and had even registered it. They would set up as rivals. They were\nserious and they meant business. All of this unpleasantness could be avoided\nif I would just hand over a pitiful 20 per cent to them, perhaps based on\nfuture performance?\nBoth as friends and colleagues, they earnestly advised me to consider\ntheir demands dispassionately and honestly. In my heart, they argued, I knew\nthey were right. It was only fair.\nI fired them on the spot. Or they walked away. I can't remember which\n- it didn't matter then and it doesn't matter now. What mattered is that I\nheld on to every single share in my company. I would run the entire bloody\ncompany myself, write the articles, design the pages, answer the phone and\nsell the ads if I had to. But I would not part with a single, solitary share. Not\nfor love. Nor for fairness. Not for loyalty. Not for anything. And certainly not\nfor moral blackmail.\nThey set up their new company. They launched their magazine. Either it\nfolded or they gave it away, I don't remember now. Two of them came back\nto work for me. There were no recriminations. I am on friendly terms with all\nfour of them to this day. Not one of them ever got rich. Nor ever will, I  \nguess.\nI didn't blame them, by the way. I would have tried the same stunt\nmyself if the positions had been reversed. But if I had tried it, I would have\nmade a damn sight more certain of its success.\n'Why doth treason never prosper? For shouldst thou fail, thou must\nhang. And if it doth succeed, why, 'twas never treason!'\nOver the next thirty years, I estimate that their suggested 20 per cent,\nhad I handed it over, would have earned those four gentlemen around\n$80,000,000 - say it again - eighty million dollars, in current asset value and\npast dividends. This is the problem with sharing ownership. The laws of\nsimple mathematics are relentless and obdurate.\n\f\nAnd if I had given 20 per cent to those four employees, should I not have\nhad to do so with many others as they joined the company and worked hard\nto make it a success? Where would it all end? I'm not a bloody charity. I'm\nan entrepreneur trying to make a small fortune, not the Salvation Army. I  \npay\npeople to get a job done. And I pay them well. I try to make it as much fun\nas I can along the way. I reward senior managers with bloody huge bonuses\nbased on performance and results. Millions of dollars have been paid out in\nsuch bonuses over the years.\nBut I will not give them a share. Not one. Not for love. Nor for loyalty.\nNot to be fair. Because capitalism isn't fair. Life isn't fair. The lottery of  \nwhat\ngenes we are born with isn't fair. The moon and the stars and the gas clouds\nof Alpha Centauri aren't fair.\nExcept for your loved ones or closest friends, it's every man for himself\nin diis world, in case you haven't noticed: 'No prisoners! The Lord will know\nhis own!' Or, in the rapier advice of Benjamin Jowett, a nineteenth-century\nmaster of Balliol College, Oxford: 'Never retreat. Never explain. Get it done\nand let them howl.'\nThe best kind of fairness is the kind that makes money. Lots of money.\nThen you can decide to do with it whatever you wish. There's a whole chap-\nter at the end of this book about it. (See Chapter 18: How to Stay Rich).\nBut we can't be wasting time thinking about and debating fairness while we\nare in money-making mode. Money making and fairness having nothing to\ndo with each other.\nJust how nasty can this all get? Say you have a brother and you want to\nstart a business together. You should begin with the proposition that you will\nown the business and he will work for it. Fight for this tenaciously. Begin by\nassuming it.\nIf that won't fly, then absolutely insist that you own 75 per cent of the\nshares. The reasons are immaterial. Make a spurious list of them and wave it\nabout. Say you won't go into business unless you own the majority share.\nHave a temper tantrum. Shout. Scream. Wave the bloody bit of paper about\nagain. Say you'll work longer hours. Say you will find more capital than he\nwill. Say anything. But GET A BIGGER SHARE OF THE COMPANY\nFOR YOURSELF.\nThen, and only then, should you return to being a reasonable human\nbeing. You can now afford to be reasonable. You are going to be richer than\n\f\nyour brother. Perhaps a lot richer. It is as simple and as vile and as nasty as\nthat. Would I do it to my brother, Julian, whom I love very much? Yes. In a\nheartbeat, if I had to. Would I give my brother all the money I ever made if\nhe needed it? Yes, I would. But I WILL NOT GIVE HIM A SHARE IN\nMY COMPANY!\nBecause ownership isn't the important thing. If you want to be rich, it's\nthe only thing.\nTHE JOYS AND PERILS OF PARTNERSHIP\n'He ain't heavy ... he's my brother.'\nSONG TITLE, BOB RUSSELL AND Bobby SCOTT\nCome to think of it, I never have. Given a share to my brother, that is. And\nhe never asked me for one. He's a sensible man with a loyal wife and two\nlovely children. He doesn't want my bloody shares.\nNor have I ever given a single share to anybody. And yet, unlike most\nentrepreneurs I know, I have enjoyed a wonderful thirty-year-plus relation-\nship with my 'white knight' American partners, Peter Godfrey and Robert\nBartner.\nIn the UK, I clung to my 100 per cent ownership like a limpet. In the\nUSA and elsewhere, I happily hitched up with Peter and Bob. And we are\nstill hitched, decades later. We have together created many companies, which\nhave operated in many countries. We have split the ownership of those\ncompanies in a dozen different ways. Once, I owned 80 per cent and they\nowned 10 per cent each. On another occasion, we owned 33.3 per cent each.\nOn more than one occasion I have been a minority shareholder.\nIt never mattered. The partnership has held like a rock through all the\nstormy weather and the trials and tribulations that are the lot of any long\nbusiness life. We have shouted at each other a few times and we have cried\non each other's shoulders more than once. We have enjoyed the thrill of the\nchase immensely. We have helped to make each other millionaires times  \nwith-\nout number.\nOnce, and only once, I even acted as an honest broker when Bob was\nthinking of suing Peter (or was it the other way round?) - I honestly cannot\nremember over what. But the point is, the partnership held, and has always\nreflected just two principles as far as sharing the pie was concerned. These are:\n1.Who is putting what capital into a venture?\n\f\n2.Who is doing what work on that venture?\nI believe I have been a good partner and an honest one for Peter and Bob,\nAnd I know they have been good and honest partners for me. We make a\ngood team.\nI am the creative maverick and usually the risk-taker. Peter is the\ncautious, stubborn and worldy-wise one. He's hard to convince. But he is a\ngreat negotiator in a clinch. Bob is the nuts and bolts wild card. He does not\nsuffer fools or errors gladly. He goes through 'the numbers' with a voracious\nappetite for them.\nBob is willing to voice misgivings that Peter and I (especially me, it has\nto be said) might quietly sweep under the carpet. It was Bob who refused,\nyears ago, to invest one more personal cent in one of our companies. He had\nrealised, long before Peter and me, that we simply were not rich enough to\nfeed this particular monster. We would have to do what we had never  \nconsid-\nered before. We would have to go public. That was Bob's doing.\nWhile Peter was working the longest hours of his life to keep this beast\nafloat, and I was stripping my own UK company of senior managers and  \nhurl-\ning them into the American monster's maw, Bob simply went to some people\nhe knew and told them we needed to go public. Without Bob, Peter and I\nmight well have worked and worried ourselves to death. We were rich men by\nthen, but not rich enough to fund what became a $2 billion corporation.\nThat's the best part of a true partnership. You always have a brother to\nhelp carry the load. And if things go wrong, you have a built-in drinking\nbuddy with whom to drown your sorrows! And you have a built-in\nconscience, too. No bad thing.\nSo if this is the case, why am I so insistent upon outright ownership,\nor, at the very least, as much as you can wangle? It's simple. I could always\nwalk away from the partnership with Peter and Bob if we fell out. I had my\nown company doing my own thing under my own control three thousand\nmiles away.\nAnd I believe the same has been true for them. Despite our close friend-\nship and real affection for each other, this knowledge, that any one of us\ncould walk away from the others if he wished, that illusion of freedom - if\nillusion it was - made it possible to compromise with each other when things\ngot tough in our partnership business.\n\f\nIf Peter and Bob had represented every iron I had in the fire, if our part-\nnership had been the only hope I had of making real money, then I believe\nit might well have disintegrated almost before it began - never mind lasting\nfor three decades. A partnership is not a marriage. In a marriage, you should\nbe willing to die for your partner. To share everything. To kill for them, if\nyou have to.\nBut in a partnership, the making of money comes first. Friendship and\naffection comes later - if you're lucky, as I have been.\nI hope that you too, dear reader, will one day be lucky enough to find\nsuch partners and enjoy similar success. But my earnest advice is that you\nestablish yourself first, retaining as much control of any start-up or  \nacquisition\nas you can, and then, and only then, seek pastures new with partners in the\npicture. That's a great way to spread risk. Partners are a wonderful thing. But\nthey are not a marriage - except of convenience. Ideally, you should keep\nsomething of your own to fall back on.\nWhy else is ownership so vital to anyone who wants to get rich?\nOwnership buys you the luxury of time. Not only the luxury of occasionally\nconsidering a partnership or an investment elsewhere. Ownership means\nnever having to waste time saying sorry that a business didn't work out. It\nmeans not having to spend weeks and weeks trying to persuade your part-\nners that a certain course of action is necessary. It means that, for better or\nworse, you can concentrate on building the business and making money. Or\nlosing it without the added burden of guilt.\nWhich brings us to minority shareholders and investors. I have owned\ncompanies with minority shareholders. And 1 have always gone out of my\nway to be fair to them and their interests. But I cannot pretend that they\nwere not a burden. Let me explain by way of example. Should I wish the\ncompany we co-own to invest all its profits for three years to build itself, a\nminority shareholder might (understandably) complain: 'It's all right for\nyou. But I depend on the dividends the company would pay me if we did not\ninvest so much. I want to protest at your investment strategy.'\nThen begins a long, tortuous affair of meetings and spreadsheets and\njockeying for position. Not because I could not force the issue. But because\nto force the issue will waste a lot of precious time and energy. Even more\ntime and energy than those endless meetings will take. Time is the only thing\nwe cannot replace, apart from our health and our lives. I resent wasting a\nmoment of it.\n\f\nBut if you want to be rich and you are forced to take minority share-\nholders on board, then I guarantee that, sooner or later, you will waste weeks\nor even months in the attempt to obtain mutual agreement. It is unavoid-\nable.\nOne of the more amusing, and deadly, clauses that can be inserted into\nany shareholder agreement is worth bearing in mind here. This clause is the\n'Mexican Shootout'. I have only seen it used once, and it all got pretty hairy\nbefore it was done, but there's no question it resolves disputes between\nshareholders quickly. Here's how it works.\nIn the Articles of Association of a company, both sides agree to insert a\nclause that governs serious disputes. If the dispute cannot be resolved, then\nthe following takes place. Each side in the dispute, each shareholder who\nwishes to participate, considers carefully what they would be willing to pay\nfor the whole company. It doesn't matter how many shares they own, but\nthey must have access to the sum they have indicated, less the worth of their\nown shares valued on an equal basis.\nThe parties then go to a neutral lawyer or professional on a certain day\nand bring with them a scaled envelope with nothing inside it but their esti-\nmate of the company's entire worth. Or, at the least, what they are willing\nto pay in total for the company. The lawyer then opens the envelopes.\nWhoever has bid the highest amount is now the owner of the company and\nmust pay the losing side for their shares, based on the winner's valuation.\nThe Mexican Shootout is a brilliant, hair-raising solution, and there are\nmany variations on it. But there are drawbacks. It rather depends which side\nof the fence you are on. In general, it favours the minority investor.\nFrom the minority shareholder's point of view, it offers the only chance\nhe or she will ever have to own the company for certain. It's true that the\nmajority shareholder might consider selling to the minority. But he or she\ndoesn't have to if the clause is omitted from the Articles. Only the shootout\ncan force the issue, providing the minority bids high enough.\nFrom the majority shareholder's point of view, providing they have suffi-\ncient cash, of course, it offers the only certain chance to be rid of a trouble-\nsome pest. But the majority shareholder has more to lose. The balance of\nweakness is in his or her court.\nIf you start off as equal partners with 50 per cent each (and I told you not\nto da that'.) then the 'Mexican Shootout' can save months, even years of\nweary argument, lost sleep and soul-numbing, teeth-grinding negotiation.  \nIf\n\f\nI was the majority shareholder, I would never permit the shootout to appear\nin the Articles of Association. If I was a minority shareholder, I might not\ninvest without it being there.\nNaturally this book is going to be read by millions. I can therefore expect\nthousands of emails and letters from successful minority shareholders or\nminority partners who have never owned the whole of their business and yet\nhave prospered mightily. They will claim that I am exaggerating the prob-\nlems of shared ownership.\nAnd perhaps they are right and I am nothing but a greedy little sod who,\nall unknowing, has been cowering in his solitary shell since the day he was\nthrown into prison. Quite possibly. But at least I am a fairly rich little sod\ncowering in his shell. What I have written here about ownership has worked\nfor me, that is all.\nI believe you should be cautious, very, very cautious indeed, before you\ntake up with a partner or invest as a minority shareholder. At the very least\nyou should spend hours with a patient, sensible lawyer (if you can find such\na creature), going through the Memorandum and Articles of the new\ncompany. Every minute you spend on that task may well be repaid a thou-\nsandfold, a millionfold at some point in the future.\nUnlike a marriage, you must contemplate the end game before taking the\nplunge. Just how will it end? How can it be ended with least damage to the\nbusiness and the hearts and minds of the partners? These are questions you\nmust consider seriously before you sign the partnership documents.\nIn summary, unless you already own a successful business outright, then\nI do not recommend you enter into a partnership of any kind if you can avoid\nit. It's time-consuming and distracting. If you have any choice whatever in  \nthe\nmatter, walk your narrow, lonely road to riches all on your little ownsome.\nAs I mentioned before, it's a nasty, lonely business getting rich.\nWHY GOING PUBLIC IS DIFFERENT\nThe public be damned! I work for my stockholders.\nWILLIAM H. VANDERBILT, US RAILWAY MAGNATE\nThere is absolutely no comparison between running and owning a private\ncompany and running a public company. (Note: by definition you cannot\n'own' a public company, although you can certainly control one, providing\nyou are willing to put up with a great deal of scrutiny.)"

    "raw_text": "We may be getting a little ahead of ourselves here, as you have yet to get\nrich in any environment, presumably. But should you manage to achieve that\nobjective successfully, you can be certain that the subject of'going public'\nwill creep its way onto the agenda in due course. And as going public is one\nway to become very rich indeed, we need to take a cursory look at it,\nI once helped to found what became a fair-sized public company,\nMicroWarehouse, and I was a part of the process of taking it public. A small\npart. That is, I owned a lot of the shares and I was asked to sign a lot of\npapers. My American partners, Peter and Bob, did most of the heavy lifting\nto get us public. Peter in particular.\nThis was because they knew damn well that if they foolishly permitted\nme to play a major role in the process of going public, the whole shebang\nmight have come crashing down about our cars. That would not have been\na good idea. There was a lot of money at stake. Hundreds and hundreds of\nmillions of dollars, in fact.\nLet's face it, I've worked hard over the years so as to be able to tell\nanyone I want in business to take a hike. But just prior to, and during, the\ncomplicated process of taking a private company into the public domain (the\nNASDAQ in our case), creative mavericks and members of the Awkward\nSquad are not welcome at the table.\nWhich table? Why, the table where endless meetings with investment\nbankers and their ferret-faced lieutenants take place. Where lawyers drone\nincomprehensibly to each other about gobbledegook with faces that look\nlike they're sucking a lemon. Where the sight of a woolly-haired Brit taking\na cigarette out of his pocket would probably have caused the building to be\nevacuated and the fire brigade and building security to be called.\nNo, Peter and Bob were wise. It wasn't my scene. Nevertheless, I was\nforced to listen to enough lectures and to sit round enough tables and listen\nto sufficient corporate legal eagles to gather that my partners and I were\nentering a different world. We were about to be entrusted with massive  \nquan-\ntities of the public's cash. And if we screwed up in any one of a hundred ways,\nthen it was chokey for us, go straight to prison, do not pass go, game over.\nI learned, for example, that after we were a public company and I was a\ndirector of that company, then should I be foolish enough to accept a call\nfrom anyone, or meet them over lunch, and casually mention that business\nwas particularly brilliant right now and that we would be announcing that\nfact formally in the near future, then I placed myself in peril. Worse still, I\n\f\nwould place Peter and Bob and my other fellow directors in similar peril.\nShould the person I had so casually spoken to then rush out and buy my\ncompany's shares, I might well find myself in prison. Should he then send  \nme\na case of the finest Pomerol wine on the planet merely to thank me for what\nI'd told him, then I would definitely go to jail. And so might Peter and Bob.\nThis is kind of an odd thing for an entrepreneur to take on board.\nEntrepreneurs are always bullshitting each other about how great business is;\nit's virtually an epidemic disease with us. But what I would have done  \nwithin\na public corporate environment by telling this mythical buddy what I told\nhim and drinking the wine he sent, even with the best of intentions, would\nhave been insider trading. A big no-no in the world of publically traded\nstocks and shares.\n(Insider trading is an easy one to understand. If you help to run a public\ncompany, nobody gets to know how you are doing before everybody gets to\nknow. Got that? It doesn't matter if the news is good or bad. It must not be\nalluded to outside of your professional advisors and company colleagues.\nEspecially the upcoming quarterly earnings and revenues. Just don't  \nmention\nit. Not even to yourself in the bath.)\nAnd this was just one of hundreds and hundreds of such rules and regu-\nlations we had to remember. Peter would sit with me over a drink and lecture\nme endlessly on keeping my mouth shut about our business. I became so\nparanoid that I almost became a voluntary mute. It was crazy and depress-\ning. Of course, I got the hang of it in time, and everything went well in the\nend. But, boy, was I glad to sell those shares a few years later and get the hell\nout of there.\nNow don't get the wrong idea. Going public made me a fortune. And\nunlike a private business, it seemed that the more we divested (sold off) our\nshares, the richer we became, because more people bought them and the\nmore those shares we still had left were worth. That sounds weird, but it's\nexactly what happened. In a private company I would virtually have to be\npried away from my shareholding with a crowbar - until I was ready to sell\nthe whole shooting match, anyway. But with a public company, everything\nseemed to be topsy-turvy.\nAnd that included selling shares. Just as directors of a public company\ncannot use their inside knowledge to enrich their lunch buddies, even inad-\n\f\nvertently, so they must not use that knowledge to enrich themselves. By sell-\ning shares when things are going badly, for instance. Not unless everyone\nknows things are going badly. Got it?\nThere were other weird rules and mantras we had not faced as a private\ncorporation. Growth was apparently all that counted. Growth in share price.\nGrowth in corporate revenues. And being in the 'right' markets (like the\ninternet, at that time). Profits were not the issue. Nobody seemed to care\nthat not a cent had ever been made by any company trading on the internet\nback then. All that mattered was that we achieved compound growth in\nflavour-of-the-month markets.\nWhen I say ' we achieved ...' what I really mean is that ''Peter achieved'.\nPeter Godfrey was the lead partner on Micro Warehouse, both before and\nafter it went public. He took to it like a duck to water. Here, the power of\ntrust in a true partnership revealed itself in letters of fire.\nDay after day, month after month, year after year, Peter drove himself\nand his Connecticut management team to the brink of mental and physical\nexhaustion. He had elected himself chairman, CEO and president - and I\nthank my lucky stars to this day that he did. Both his steely temperament and\nattention to detail were uniquely suited to this ball-breaking task - and\nsuited, too, to marathon board meetings (which sometimes lasted ten hours\nor more) and to smoothing the ruffled feathers of institutional investors.\nThe paperwork alone was beyond my comprehension. I remember stag-\ngering into one board meeting carrying two huge bags stuffed with reports,\nagendas and memoranda. Then Bob arrived with three bags full. Then Peter\nmarched in with an associate buckled under the weight of a filing-cabinet-\nsized pile. We all burst out laughing, perhaps a little sheepishly. But the  \nstrain\nwas beginning to tell. Public company management was testing to the limit\nwhat had once been an easy-going partnership.\nAs Micro Warehouse grew from a half billion, to a billion, then to nearly\ntwo billion dollars of revenues from operations in half a dozen countries,\nBob and I knew we were virtually tagging along for the ride. We did our best\nand we kept our heads down, but we never really got the hang of it the way\nPeter did. We kept thinking like entrepreneurs, making unhelpful entrepre-\nneurial suggestions. Personally, I was way out of my depth - and was all too\naware of it.\nA private company could never have operated in the way Peter was\nrequired to run Micro Warehouse. A private company lives on profits and\n\f\nreserves. There has to be a balance between investment and profit-taking.\nBetween growth and the bottom line. In a private company, growth is not a\ngoal in itself; you only grow if it makes sense to grow.\nBut a public company exists only to boost its share price, and its share\nprice is determined, incredibly enough, by 'analysts' - spotty-faced youths\nwho live on another planet where growth-at-any-price is the only deity one\nis encouraged to worship. Medium- or long-term strategies were for wimps\nand amateurs, in their estimation, 'This quarter's results, this quarter's\ngrowth, were the only things that mattered to them. It almost seemed, at\ntimes, as if profit was a dirty word. If we were making 'profits', asked the\n'analysts', weren't we in danger of 'wasting' money that could have been\ninvested to produce more 'growth'?\nHuh?\nMadness! But it made me very rich. It made all three of us very rich. I\ncannot deny that. Sales of our Micro Warehouse shares put hundreds of\nmillions of dollars in our collective pocket. Peter's tour de force had paid \noff.\nAll was well that ended well.\nAnd how did it end? It ended when we engineered the sale of\nMicroWarehonse back into the private sector via a huge investment consor-\ntium. Suddenly, our services were no longer required. The so-called 'profes-\nsionals' had taken over. As far as I was concerned, they were welcome to it.\nI think even Peter was glad it was finally over. I categorically know that his\nwife Barbara was!\nI remember the evening Peter came to join Bob and me at a quiet cele-\nbration in a small Manhattan restaurant following the sale. I barely recognised\nhim as he approached our table, casually dressed in a leather jacket and base-\nball cap - I hadn't seen him without a suit and tie for nearly five years. Nor\nwas he carrying the ever-present bags full of paper. But the strain of the past\nfew years' toil was etched all over his beaming face as he threw his hands in\nthe air, to the astonishment of other diners, and recited a joyous imitation of\nMartin Luther King: 'Free at last! Free at last! God Almighty, I'm free at last!'\nBob and I had our partner back from the salt mines, and all was well with\nthe world. Even today, I wonder how the three of us ever found our way out\nof that nightmare labyrinth.\nThat's all I know, and all I want to know, about public companies. From\nmy perspective, they are not sane places and their share prices are not decided"

    "raw_text": "by sane people. Perhaps it's different when a company has been public for\nmany years. But the first few years of any such enterprise are ones of gut-\nwrenching adjustment, soul-destroying workloads and barely concealed\nterror. It's a high price to pay for those at the sharp end.\nBut hey! If you want to be rich, sometimes you have to sup with the\ndevil. And nobody cares, least of all 'analysts', how long or how short your\nspoon is.\n1 3\nTHE JOYS OF\nDELEGATION\nWork is of two kinds: first, altering the. position of matter\nat or near the earth's surface relatively to other such matter;\nsecond, telling other people to do so. The first is unpleasant\nand ill paid; the second is pleasant and highly paid.\nBERTRAND  RussELL, 'I N PRAISE  OF IDLENESS '\nThis will be one of the shortest chapters in my book. The quote above from\nthe philosopher and mathematician Bertrand Russell says it all. Well, nearly\nall. Not that Russell was ever a rich man. He was too wise for that.\nTry reading his quote again and reflecting for a moment. Under what\ncircumstances is his statement not quite true? Quite a few, when you begin\nto think about it.\nFor example, I understand that the foul-mouthed and amusing US\n'shock jock' Howard Stern is now about to earn hundreds of millions of\ndollars by switching his shows to a new satellite radio network. Good for\nhim. He has the right to have as much fun at the expense of others as he\nwishes and to get as rich as he pleases. But how much would Mr Stern earn\nif he delegated his show to others?\nThe answer is that, after a short while, he would get nothing. His listen-\ners and viewers want Howard Stern. He must 'alter the position of matter at\nor near the earth's surface relatively to other such matter' himself. He cannot\ntell others to do it. His audience would not put up with a substitute. Actors,\ncelebrities, kings, politicians, artists and a host of others, either do the job in\nperson, or they lose the job - and the income that comes with the job.\nSure they can delegate certain things to others. But Queen Elizabeth II,\n\f\nfor example, ensures her role by appearing, in person, in a punishing round\nof personal audiences and appearances that would tax the stamina of some-\none a third of Her Majesty's age. For the queen, as with Mr Stern, personal\nattendance is mandatory.\nBack in 1861, the young Queen Victoria was shattered by the death of\nher husband, Prince Albert and went into self-imposed seclusion from public\nlife. This did not go down well with her ministers or with her subjects. 'The\nWidow of Windsor' was informed after some years, pretty brutally, that either\nshe must get back in the spotlight or she must abdicate. Not surprisingly (and\nprobably deeply unamused), she tottered back on stage.\nDelegation for many, then, will only stretch so far. But for most of us\nwith a desire to get rich, it will take us further than the inexperienced could\nbelieve. And, as Bertrand Russell noted, it is by far the most pleasant part of\nthe whole business.\nI say this not because I am idle - I'm anything but - but because the\nexercise of delegation, used responsibly, allows you to bring out the best in\nothers and to make yourself rich in the process. It is the nearest thing to a\n'virtuous circle' imaginable. Just imagine getting rich while you're helping\nothers to help you get richer and prove their worth in the process. Magic!\nIt used to be surprising to me why so many people appeared to have a\nproblem with delegating. But I finally figured it out, and the answer isn't a\npretty one. It concerns our old bugaboo, ownership.\nIf you own a company and that company's purpose is to make you\nwealthy, you will be content, delighted even, for any amount of glory to go\nto anyone who works there, providing you get the money. It is in your best\ninterests to delegate whenever it makes sense in such circumstances.\nIf you do not own the company, or a part of it, then it is possible you are\nonly a senior manager because you like power. It is not true of everyone, of\ncourse. But often enough. You like bossing people about. You enjoy telling\nthem what to do. If that is the case, then you might be understandably reluc-\ntant to delegate real power or opportunity, in case the person you delegate\nto proceeds to excel. This, in turn, may well demonstarte to the rest of the\ncompany what a no-hum manager you really are.\nThis is a warped way of thinking. But I am convinced it lies behind much\nof the reluctance to delegate I have encountered in my business life. I used\nto be surprised at the reluctance of others, both in and out of my own\ncompanies, to delegate. Now I'm not."

    "raw_text": "Bossy people and glory hounds are mostly interested in building a power\nbase so they can have yet more people to boss about. It's pitiful and a tittle\nsad, but we have all seen it. We saw it in school. We saw it in the  \nplayground.\nWe saw it in college. And we saw it in our first job. If you are observant, you\nhave been seeing it nearly all your life.\nSuch bullies and toads appear to cover the earth. They often gravitate\ntowards jobs that give the appearance of power but which require low(ish) \nskill\nlevels - security companies, the prison service, immigration and customs, \nminor\ncivil service roles, non-commissioned officers in the armed forces, and so on. I\nam not suggesting that these organisations are made up solely of such \ncreatures;\nbut who would disagree that they have more than their fair share of them?\nThis is fine, because they are easy to spot in such rotes, and they have to\nwork somewhere. They are mostly an obnoxious nuisance. But cleverer  \nspec-\nimens are also probably working right next door to you today. The truly evil\nones, through a combination of fawning, flattery, smoke, mirrors and luck\n(and occasionally, even talent), have risen to the middle ranks and have\npeople reporting directly to them.\nThis type of managerial toad will often talk about training and delegation\nin sepulchral tones, but then, as the old proverb tells us, 'the Devil can quote\nscripture for his own purpose'. Such toads know they are unlikely to rise\nfurther, but take pleasure in ensuring that you won't, either.\nWhen they do delegate, they enjoy delegating tasks they believe are either\nimpossible or beyond the recipient's ability to complete satisfactorily. How\ndo you counter this idiocy? You don't - unless you own the company, in\nwhich case you fire them. I have fired a few. It was the only time I enjoyed\nfiring anyone.\nYou can't deal with bossy, puffed-up sods who won't train you and won't\ndelegate. You can only move departments or change your place of work. It\nisn't worth the time to do anything else.\nThe whole point about getting rich is not to have to deal with this\nnonsense. Office politics can be fun, as can all forms of politics, but to many\npeople they are upsetting. They reduce productivity and dent morale. They\ncan take up astonishing amounts of time. They increase the number of'sick\n\f\ndays' in a department - which is often a good indication that a toad is in\ncharge and needs to be winkled out of its hole.\nTrue delegation is an entirely different matter and can often be a joy to\nbe involved in. On both sides. As an owner, or an owner in training, you\nmust always be alert for the telltale signs that here is a candidate for promo-\ntion and delegation. They are smart. Perhaps smarter than you are. They\nwork hard and they appear to love the work they do. They ask intelligent\nquestions and don't waste time gossiping and mucking about. They listen\nand correct their errors, and don't repeat them. They want your job.\nEspecially in the early days of your company, delegation and promotion\nare among your most powerful weapons to get rich. Men and women with\nspirit will be prepared to leave safe, comfortable jobs and work for you,\nproviding the atmosphere of the new operation is loaded with optimism,\nadventure, the sweet scent of delegation and the promise of promotion.\nNot everyone works to get rich. In fact, most people do not. But almost\neveryone wishes to be respected. With promotion comes respect. And with\ndelegation comes promotion. If your company is young and a bit rickety,\nmeritocracy, delegation and promotion are the bricks and mortar that will\nmake it stronger.\nDo not seek a replica of yourself to delegate to, or to promote. Watch\nout for this, it is a common error with people setting out to build a company.\nYou have strengths and you have weaknesses in your own character. It  \nmakes\nno sense to increase those strengths your organisation already possesses and\nnot address the weaknesses.\nIf you are bad at keeping records and filing and tend sometimes to shoot\nfrom the hip, for example (that sounds a familiar description!) then bring in\npeople who have the organisational skills that you lack and who tend to be\nof a more even disposition. It's so easy to delegate important work to people\nwho arc similar in temperament and skill-sets to you, or to promote them.\nSo easy and so wrong. You may be the founder or the owner, but you cannot\ndo everything yourself- even if you could make time stand still. By setting\nan example early on with a programme of carefully tailored delegation and\nwell-deserved promotion, you will create an atmosphere of loyalty, efficiency\nand camaraderie that feeds upon itself. An atmosphere poisonous to toads.\nAny leader will tell you of the importance of morale. And it is important.\nIt cannot compensate for sloppy work, or for lack of persistence or belief in\nyourself. It cannot compensate for a lack of determination to succeed or for\n\f\nill fortune. Nonetheless, good morale, a pervasive feeling of 'us against the\nworld', combined with the promise of responsible delegation and promotion\nbased on achievement, can move mountains. And under those mountains is\ngold. Your gold.\nBut what exactly is delegation?\nLet me put it this way. The work undertaken by your colleagues and\nemployees is more important than your work. Your job is merely to lead,\nperhaps just to point in the right direction. This is advice I suspect will fall\non stony ground for the uninitiated. Let me be crystal clear.\nI am not suggesting you will have an easy time of it or that you will not\nwork long and unsociable hours. You will. All of us who made our own\nmoney did and it will be little different for you. But I have the benefit now\nof hindsight, I look back along the years and see myself working like a\nproverbial Trojan. A stupid Trojan. You can avoid this trap.\nI see a young man who would think nothing of working a sixteen-hour\nday - going out into the London night for a drink and a swift curry, coming\nback into the office for a few hours' kip on the office sofa and beginning the\nprocess all over again. And I see the same young man, dragging himself in\non Saturdays and Sundays, pale with self-inflicted exhaustion. Snappy. Quick\nto criticise and too slow to delegate and praise others. I see a young man\ntrying too hard, but not delegating enough.\nMonth after month, in those early days, I battered myself and my staff\ninto setting world records for stamina and effort. Did it make me rich? No.\nIt made me tired, bad-tempered and arrogant. It led me to make errors of\njudgement which I would have avoided had I gone about it a smarter way.\nIn essence, all I did was show my 'troops' that I possessed awesome\nstamina. I was the toughest digger in the mine and I could shovel more coal\nthan any two of the rest of them put together. Big deal.\nI had forgotten that I wasn't in a bloody mine. I wasn't being paid for\nthe hours I kept. Miners rarely get rich. They merely build a legend if they\nare strong enough or unlucky enough to waste their life in an unhealthy and\npoisonous environment. Fortunately, this fit of madness (it tasted about\nthree years) eventually passed.\nI only started to get rich when I began to delegate and to ease up on my\nwork schedule. How exactly this occurred I'm not certain. Selecting good\npeople has never been a problem for me - yes, I know everyone thinks that,\nbut I have a pretty good track record to back it up. Perhaps those talented\n\f\npeople began to edge up on me without my knowing. Perhaps they 'stole'\nwork inch by inch. And perhaps I had just enough wit to let them.\nI'm sure my 'vanishings' on a boat in the Norfolk Broads helped. I\nwould just take off (no notice, no plan), summer or winter, and allow the\nboat to wander among the reeds and herons and riverside villages for a week\nor two. Alone mostly. Or with a friend from my school days called Bruce\nSawford, who had the companionable knack of not talking too much.\nDuring those unscheduled absences, life in our tiny company had to go\non. There were some smart young boys and girls there, and they grew used\nto my peripatetic absences. In the interim, they would 'delegate' the work to\nthemselves and often keep those responsibilities when I returned. Yes, I think\nthat was how it happened.\nIt wasn't a good way to go about growing a company. Nor a very smart\none. But I had no rote model, nor even the vaguest grasp of management\ntechniques. I just assumed the world revolved around me and everything\nwould turn out OK if I worked an insane number of hours every day. Rather\nlike setting a billion monkeys typing incessantly in the hope that one of\nShakespeare's plays would emerge.\nMy company was lucky to survive those early days and I owe a real debt\nto the colleagues who worked with me back then. It probably helped that my\ncompany was a fun place to work, otherwise it might not have survived.\nAdded to which, hard work never bothers the young. They think they are\nbuilt of steel.\nBut you don't have to go about starting up a business like that. You have\nthe benefit of reading this book and examining all the ridiculous errors I\nmade as I stumbled from one catastrophe to another. Then again, there are\na lot more entrepreneurial role models, like Richard Branson, to learn from\nthese days. There weren't so many back in the early 1970s, or at least it\ndidn't seem as if there were.\nHow do you learn how to delegate wisely? Trial and error, I would say.\nI have been constandy surprised all my business life at who faces up to chal-\nlenges best. It is very often not those who talk the best talk.\nFor example, I used to fancy myself as a great negotiator in big deals, but\nI have learned that I am not. The reason is that I never do negotiate, I only\ndictate. That's fine if the other side's need is greater than yours in the balance\nof weakness. But what if there is a potential win-win situation to be reached\nthrough patient and reasoned negotiating?\n\f\nThat's when I delegate. Automatically and without thinking. I have\npeople who work for me who are patient, who listen better than I do, and\nwho are quiedy determined to get the best deal they can with a potential\npartner while not scaring them off. They are willing to compromise, but not\nto surrender. Long after I would have lost interest and wandered away to\nfind something more interesting to do, they will still be patiendy negotiat-\ning until an agreement is reached. These are not people I would ask into the\nroom to negotiate the sale of a large asset. They have too much empathy\nwith the other side. But for the majority of symbiotic deals and arrangements\na company needs to make, their skills far surpass mine.\nWhat else do I delegate? Almost everything now. I do not run my\ncompanies and have not done so for many, many years. Rivals do not believe\nthis. They smile knowingly when I tell them that. Perhaps because many of\nthem are not good delegators. But they are wrong. I don't run my compa-\nnies. And I have no desire to.\nInstead of attempting to stay in day-to-day control, I have devised a\nsystem where I keep overall control, but do not involve myself in running a\nbusiness unless I wish to get involved for a particular reason, I use the power\nof veto instead.\nBy making myself the chairman of all my companies, I can choose to\nattend or not attend senior management or board meetings as it suits me.\nOn average, I will attend four to six such meetings a year for each company.\nThe chair is usually taken in my absence by the MD, the president or\nthe CEO, Verbatim minutes are taken. (I do read all the minutes of these\nmeetings very carefully, and I can get a mite cross if diey are not produced\npromptly and accurately. For me, they are not a memorandum of past\nevents. They are a tool to understanding current positions.) I also have Ian\nLeggett, my personal financial manager as well as my group CFO, placed on\nall these boards. If I am not present, you can be sure he is.\nMy vetoes are carefully explained and very well known to all of my exec-\nutives, who agree to abide by them before they join the board. It's a short\nlist, but has worked well for many years.\nWithout my express permission:\n1.They may not vote anyone on or off the board.\n2.They may not physically move the headquarters of the company.\n3.They may not dispose of, or shut down, any substantial asset.\n\f\n4.They may not purchase, or launch, any substantial new product or\nbusiness.\n5.They may not award themselves bonuses or salary increases.\nThat's it. No more vetoes. Within those guidelines, the managers of my\ncompanies are free to get on with their jobs, grow the business and reach the\nmargin return agreed upon at the beginning of the year. A margin that they\nwill have arrived at among themselves by consensus. With Tan's beady eye on\nthem while they do it!\nIf things go wrong in a particular part of the business, then I will get\ninvolved. When we are about to launch, sell or close something, I am always\ninvolved.\nTo run a group of companies like this you have to trust your managers\nand directors. You can only do it if you have learned, by long experience,  \nthe\nart ot delegation. It is important to distinguish between delegation and\nabandonment. Absentee landlords never prosper. I am not absent. But I am\nnot exactly toiling with the troops side by side, every minute of every day.\nMy days of toiling in those particular mines are well and truly over.\nTo be honest, I suspect my managers prefer it that way. They certainly\nget to take more scary decisions more often. And that's half the thrill of\ntheir job, I hope. As our senior management turnover rate is one of the\nlowest in the industry, and has been for years, my system must have some-\nthing going for it.\nOne thing I do to compensate for this style of ownership is to look hard\nfor signs of excellent work. When I spot it on one of our websites, or in a\nmagazine, or from management minutes or financial results, I drop a hand-\nwritten note to whoever is responsible. And I do it often.\nI also invite folk who work for me to visit me in my private office, which\nis about half a mile from our company headquarters, usually after work. And\nwhen I visit any particular company in the flesh, it's usually without warning,\non the spur of the moment.\nWhy do I do things this way? Because I want to write poetry and plant a\nforest in the heart of England, and that takes a lot of time. Because I have a\nlife and intend to lead it. Because I have discovered that many, many people\nare better managers than I am. Because I have learned that obsessive micro-\nmanagement scares away talent.\nAnd most of all, because I learned to delegate a long time ago and to\n\f\naccept that you must allow young managers the opportunity to make\nmistakes without crushing them or blaming them when things go wrong.\n(You can always fire them if they make the same error over and over.)\nBecause I love to see talent grow in the stable and watch it come hurtling\nout of the box at full gallop. Because it make me a little proud to be a part\nof such a process. Because I get easily bored. For all of those reasons.\nI'm not saying mine is the greatest system ever devised, and I am sure\nyou will devise your own. You need great senior managers to keep my partic-\nular way sweet. In any case, you may be one of those who feels guilty when\nyou are out of the office while others toil to keep your company humming\nand growing. I can relate to that. That's just how I used to feel.\nOn a related note, let me make a plea concerning the pernicious role of\nelectronic communication in delegation. I'll start by confessing that I am\nsomething of a Luddite when it comes to emails and texting and  \nBlackberries\nand downloads and mobile phones. Quite frankly, I hate the things and all\ntheir works.\nIt enrages me to see senior managers wasting their time (often hours each\nday) wading through emails, which are often informing them that the recep-\ntionist's sister has just had a baby or some such nonsense. I have been known\nto wreak physical violence on a cell phone that begins to squawk in the  \nmiddle\nof meetings, or on a Blackberry which is being used surreptitiously under the\n\f\ntable by its owner. Not only is it bad manners, such interruptions break the\nflow and concentration necessary for real decision-making.\nAll this is bad enough. But have you ever considered how the growth\nof such devices has conspired to damage and corrupt delegation in the work-\nplace? If you go on holiday or a business trip and keep obsessively in touch\nvia a mobile phone or Blackberry with the office, what does that say about\nyour management style? About the trust you have in your colleagues 'mind-\ning the ranch'?\nIt says you don't trust them. It says you cannot delegate meaningfully. It\nsays you are a meddler and a micro-manager So don't do it!\nIf you want to get rich, then learn to delegate. Don't learn to pretend to\ndelegate. Delegation is not only a powerful tool, it is the only way to\nmaximise and truly incentive your most precious asset - the people who\nwork for you.\nReal delegation can help make you rich. But only if you work at it. 1 4\nA PIECE\nOF THE PIE\nWhat is robbing a bank compared with founding a bank?\nBERTOLT BRECHT, DIE DRIEGROSCHENOPER\nSHARING AND GROWING THE PIE\nIn most of mankind, gratitude is merely\nit secret hope for greater favours.\nDuc DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULD , MAXIMES\nDespite all my hard words about establishing ownership and caution where\npartners are concerned, I am a great believer in sharing the annual pie\naround. That is, I believe in incentives that help concentrate the mind and\nbring a sense of competition and purpose to management.\nWhat I do not believe in, are incentives handed over as a kind of sop (you\nwill find these everywhere) or in an owner sharing the proceeds of an asset\nsale unless contractually bound to do so.\nUse the annual profits of a company to grow the business by all means.\nOne of the ways of making it grow is to carefully craft bonuses for those  \nwho\nwork for you to achieve margin, cost and revenue targets. This is a great idea\n\f\neven if you are going short at the time yourself and your sales manager is\nearning more than you are that year. Sounds crazy? Well, it worked for me!\nBut when it comes to a sale, when you cash in your asset for  big bucks,\nthen I dispute the necessity (or even the fairness, not that life is fair) of hand-\ning over substantial chunks of the big bucks to people who did not risk their\ncash or livelihoods to create the business.\nHanding over a substantial portion of the proceeds from the sale of an\nasset to employees makes no logical sense. Almost certainly the people now\nworking for an asset sold by you will continue in their employment under a\nnew owner. If not, they will be compensated - the law, not to mention\ncommon decency, ensures it. Why then would you want to hand them a  \nwind-\nfall? You're not responsible for motivating them any more. The new owner  \nis.\nGratitude? Don't make me laugh. I have had many, many employees\nwhom my company encouraged and groomed over several years suddenly\nleave my company for a wonderful position elsewhere. Often without a\nsecond thought. Nor did I blame them one iota.\nTo the contrary, I am proud, as proud as Lucifer, that we have been able\nto offer them the opportunity to grow and excel and build their skills to the\npoint that they have been poached by a rival. Why would I not be?\nDennis Publishing alumni litter the senior management offices of my\nrivals. I love them all. I'm proud of them. And many of them are rather fond\nof the 'Bearded Dwarf', my nickname among them. But neither they, nor\ntheir ex-colleagues still at my company, deserve a piece of the asset pie.\nSo am I just an ingrate? Is this 'the unacceptable face of capitalism'? I\ndon't believe so. Employees work for a salary. That salary is guaranteed.  \nThey\nare also awarded pension contributions from their company and, in some\ninstances, health care and other perks. They risked nothing but a small poten-\ntial embarrassment when they applied for the job in the first place. They are\nnot owners. The financier John Paul Getty put it best half a century ago:\nThe meek shall inherit the earth, but not the mineral rights,\nExactly. Risk equals reward. 'An honest day's work for an honest day's pay'\nis not risk-taking.\nIf you work in my mine, I'll pay you fairly, try to make it a great mine to\nwork in, incentivise you if it makes sense for the company to do so,\n\f\ncontribute to your pension, perhaps contribute to your health care and the\nhealth care of your family, teach you to grow your skills and thereby  \nimprove\nyour personal net worth, ensure you have paid vacations, ensure you are not\nbullied or in any way discriminated against, and concern myself with your\npersonal safety at work.\nI will do all these wonderful things in a thoughtful and consistent\nmanner. BUT I WILL NOT SHARE OUT THE PIE WITH YOU WHEN\nI SELL THE MINE AND ITS MINERAL RIGHTS. Fair enough? If you\ndon't think it's fair, please take a job somewhere else. I accept that that is\nwhy I am rich and you are not. But that is how the system under which we\nlabour is constructed. If you want to change it, go into politics. (You won't\nchange it there, either, but that's another story.)\nThere are exceptions, of course. Important exceptions.\nVery senior managers who turned down attractive offers from elsewhere\nto stay with the company and grow it, perhaps. Very long-term employees.\nKey employees who made a crucial difference to the viability and growth of\nthe particular asset about to be sold. They should certainly be considered  \nfor\na piece of the asset-sale pie, but generosity should be tempered with the facts\nset out above concerning risks and rewards. And they cure facts, you know.\nWhat about incentives from annual profits offered to senior employees?\nThey are absolutely necessary, but they represent a problem which has vexed\nme all my business life. I do not think I have ever got it right. Your aim, as\nan owner, is simple: it is to improve management efficiency, productivity and\nfrugality, and thereby improve future profits while still encouraging growth.\nBut the balance is crucial, and many managers attempt to reach their\ntargets simply by cutting costs. This can be fatal.\nAny fool can cut costs anywhere at any time. For one shining moment it\nwill look as if he or she is a genius at increasing the bottom line. Then the\nmoment will pass (unless the cuts were from an excessively fat cow) and  \nqual-\nity will collapse. Keeping costs down is vital in almost any business except\ngovernment (how I wish I owned a government) but it should not be the\nmain focus of senior managers.\nInstead, the balance between annual profit and investment for future\ngrowth is the key. Revenues versus costs is important, but the latter should\n\f\nnot be cut merely to meet management bonus targets.\nThere is also a truth that is antithetical to the tenor of this book. For\nwhatever reason, a surprising number of first-class employees (managers or\notherwise) are not overly motivated by money. They want security, or\nrespect, or the chance to learn or the opportunity to shine. Often they\nrequire little more than a decent salary in a company where they feel moti-\nvated and valued.\nYou and I, on the other hand, for the purposes of this book, are greedy\nlittle sods solely bent on the pursuit of wealth. We must be very careful not\nto load our own sins on the shoulders of the innocents described in the last\nparagraph. They are what the English call 'the salt of the earth'.\nYou won't get far if you attempt to financially 'incentivise' the salt of the\nearth. Praise, the ability to discern when a good job has been done and the\ncourtesy to say so, fairness, integrity and camaraderie should be employed\ninstead. It takes more trouble than mere bribery, but it produces wonder-\nful results.\nThere are arguments to the contrary, too, about any thought or consid-\neration of the financial reward that ownership and keeping most of the pie\nbrings in its wake. Most of them come from the central tenets of world reli-\ngions - organisations whose assets and resources rival that of many multina-\ntional corporations, it might be added. Even so, these religions have been\ncredited in the past, rightly or wrongly, with carrying the flame of eternal\ntruths, truths that men are apt to forget from generation to generation. Let's\ntake a brief look at their attitude towards gathering wealth.\nTake the Bible first. In Matthew 19, v. 26 we learn, in words taken\ndirectly from the Son of the God of Christians, that: 'It is easier for a camel\nto go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the king-\ndom of God.' Pretty strong stuff when you consider the alternative on offer\nin the Old Testament.\nOr again, from Matthew: 'Lay not up to yourself treasures upon earth,\nwhere moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and\nsteal. But lay up for yourself treasures in heaven.'\nStirring words, but for many hundreds of years it was taught that one\nway for a man to lay up 'treasures in heaven' for himself was to give money\nto the Catholic church. The more you gave, the more you were likely to\nbe saved - and to hell with the widow's mite, was the cry of Christian bish-\nops then. (Bishops, in those days, lived like kings. Archbishops lived like"

    "raw_text": "emperors. I do not think it would be wise for me to comment about those\nhigher up the chain, although the evidence is there for those who wish to\nread it.)\nAnd again, in the Bhagavad Gita, a Hindu holy poem from a religion\nwhich was old before the coming of any Jewish prophet, we read: 'Set thy\nheart upon thy work but never upon its reward. Work is not for a reward:\nbut never cease to do thy work.' Just as the Devil can quote scripture for his\nown purposes, this might cynically be viewed as a more beautiful rendering\nof the old canard: 'I never meant to get rich. I just did what I love doing and\nI got rich by accident.' But I will not say so. It is difficult to comprehend\nmeaning down the long centuries.\nIf I were writing a book about how to be happy, then I would recom-\nmend much to you along the same lines. Love of any work, diligently under-\ntaken, no matter what it is, brings contentment and, eventually, respect. But\nit will rarely bring you riches. And that is what you are reading this book for,\nis it not?\nIn the Koran, too, and in Taoism and scores of other religions or\nphilosophies there are warnings about the very attitudes extolled in this\nbook. Even today, the morality tales at the heart of Hollywood films like\nWall Street, and many others, warn against greed. They warn with a wink, it\nis true; but they warn just the same.\nSo is it worth it? Should we pursue the Pie at all?\nThis is not a question for me to consider here at any length. I have\nbecome a poet, a serious one, too, and I wrestle with such questions every-\nday in the three hours I put aside to write verse. But you are not to consider\nthis. You are to consider that I might well be a hypocrite, because I took to\nwriting poetry after I had 'laid up my treasure' on earth.\nI have wasted vast amounts of my life 'laying up treasure'. I have exiled\nmyself for months at a time to plunder the riches of the USA and to bring\nthem back to Europe. Many are the nights I lay awake in my New York\napartment, listening to the eerie sirens and street sounds which define that\ngreat city, while I dreamed of spring in an English country garden thousands\nof miles away.\nLet's pause, just for moment, to consider how I came to regard that trek\nin hindsight and in sonnet form:\nProdigal Son\n\f\nOften I ventured in Babylon's towers,\nNever a friend I met — never a one,\nPlaying the part of the prodigal son.\nMany the weeks and many the hours,\nBarely a moment to think of the flowers\nPatiently budding in Warwickshire's air.\nNever a thought of a snapdragon there,\nOr May on the hedge. All of my powers\nSpent upon gilding the lilies of gain,\nWhile blue-eyed forget-me-nots lowered their gaze,\nTheir beauty unmourned in an English lane.\nYet now, as I lie amidst Babylon's maze,\nDecked in the trappings of fabulous dross,\nBy the sirens of night, I weep for their loss.\nWell, I can weep all I want. Not a moment of those long, long years worship-\nping Mammon can be brought back. Just as I cannot bring back the dead\nforget-me-nots from past spring days I never saw.\nDoes it matter if I now own the lane, or half of the county for that\nmatter? Or that it was purchased with treasure brought back from across the\nAtlantic after years of sweat? You might want to think about that.\nBut don't think too long if you want to get rich.\nPROTECTING THE P I E\nThe Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,\nAll on a summer day:\nThe Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,\nAnd took them quite away!\nLEWIS CARROLL, ALICE'S ADVENTURES  IN WONDERLAND\nSooner or later someone is going to try to steal your pie. This will not be\nunfair. You almost certainly set out to steal someone else's in the first place\nand may well, to some degree, have succeeded. There is very little that is new\nunder the sun and the supply of pie is not infinite.\nBut enough of philosophy, already. Here comes another wannabe or a\ngreat big corporation. They like the look of what you've been baking in the\nkitchen, and decide to bake something very similar. They want to put you\nout of business."

    "raw_text": "What to do? First let's take a look at the nature of rivalry and competi -\ntion in a capitalist society.\n'Competition is all that makes capitalism bearable.' Without rigorous\ncompetition, all forms of Western-based societies would soon be ruled, not\nby parliaments or their equivalent, but by fat, bloated and impregnable\nmonopolies. (Some would argue they already are.) You wouldn't like it\nmuch. People of my age and older have personal experience of it.\nYou think I'm joking? Obviously you're not old enough to remember\nthe days before rationing ended. Or the days before Freddie Laker intro-\nduced the concept of cheap air travel. British Airways and their American\ncousins ruled the roost at the time, and charged whatever the hell they\nwanted to charge for you to fly. They had virtually no competition. You paid\nup, or you stayed grounded,\nOr perhaps you cannot recall when the GPO (the General Post Office),\nwas in charge of telephone communications - which were then hived off to\nBritish Telecom in a bogus 'public-flotation'. They, too, had no competitors.\n'You'd like a new phone in your flat? Certainly, madam. That will be loads-\na-money up front and we'll come to install it at our convenience - shall we\nsay in four months?' Four months if you were lucky, that was. And if you\ndidn't complain.\nBritain in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and much of the 1980s was ruled by\na combination of monopolistic, undemocratic unions who spent all day arm-\nwrestling with a bunch of monopolistic, undemocratic nationalised indus-\ntries. British citizens never got a look in. The word 'customer' was alien to\nalmost everyone involved, except what was left of 'private industry'.\nAround the world, by friend and foe alike, the UK was called the 'Sick\nMan of Europe', and that's exactly what we were. All because so much\ncompetition had been sucked out of the country by the creation of monop-\nolies, which, if they were not owned by the government, were regulated by\nthem to the point of virtual control.\nI have little time for many of Margaret Thatcher's policies. By my lights\nshe was a warmonger and a damn sight too full of herself. But she smashed\nthe union's grip on Britain's economy and helped create a climate in which\ndenationalisation of major industries became the cry for Socialist, Liberal and\nConservative alike. And if you don't like my reading of history, ask Tony\nBlair. He'll tell you much the same, although his words will be softer and\naltogether more prudent.\n\f\nShe did not reduce taxes fast enough. And she did not listen to anyone\nexcept her 'inner voices' concerning Europe, pensions, red tape, bureaucracy,\nthe health service and a hundred and one other things. But I, and many thou-\nsands like me, will always be grateful to the old handbag for bringing the \nsweet\naroma of competition back to what, after all, is a nation of shopkeepers.\nI am a Labour man born and bred. I will die voting Labour. It's a tribal\nthing. It's plain stupid. But I still believe (well, just) that 'the inch of differ-\nence', as my friend Richard Neville put it, 'between the Conservative and\nLabour party, is the inch in which my friends and I live'.\nEven so, that lack of competition nearly ruined Britain. It wasn't entirely\nLabour's doing - much of it had to do with the loss of markets and lack of\ncapital following the devastation of World War II. But it brought us to the  \nedge\nof an abyss from which I doubt we would have crawled out in my lifetime.\nThatcher dragged us back from that brink, and nobody knows that better than\nthe current Labour administration. Aftes all, they stole many of her and John\nMajor's policies, and made them their own. Very successfully, too.\nNow that's how to handle competition!\nCompetition isn't some misty-eyed concept that should be confined to\nstudents of the 'dismal science', Economics. Competition is the heart, soul,\nliver, lungs and kidney of the beast we call Western capitalism. How you\nreact to it, how you face up to it, defines whether you can stay rich, and\nprobably whether you can get rich at all.\nI'm a fighter. My natural reaction to provocation in business, as in life, is\nto attack. But this basic instinct has led me astray many times, and I have\nlearned to think a little more carefully before tearing into the enemy with\nfangs bared. Let's take an example.\nAt the beginning of the 1990s, my company owned more than half of\nthe personal computer magazine titles in the UK. We were making a small\nfortune. Most importandy we owned a brute called Computer Shopper (we\nstill do), one of the only magazines in Europe which clocked in one  \nthousand\npages of advertising in a good issue. This was a magazine worth defending.\nMy biggest rival in Britain was the Dutch company VNU, headed up by\nGraeme Andrews, the chap who had masterminded VNU's purchase of  \nPCW\nmagazine from Dennis Publishing in 1982."

    "raw_text": "I was contacted by Ziff Davis, a powerfull magazine-publishing company\nbased in Park Avenue, New York City. Ziff Davis was owned by one of the\nfinest magazine publishers who ever lived, Bill Ziff, and he wanted to talk to\nme on the telephone. I had met Bill a few times, and had sold him the\nAmerican edition of MacUser in 1986, a magazine I'd launched in the USA\nwith my partners, Peter and Bob.\nEveryone had done well out of the deal, not least because Bill had\npersuaded me to spend a year babysitting MacUser in New York after  \nselling\nit. He had achieved that feat by offering to increase the sale price substan-\ntially if we hit ambitious targets. I had hit them, all right - there was a lot of\nmoney involved. Close to $20 million.\nBut that had been a few years back. Our conversation went something\nlike this:\n'Hello, Felix.'\n'Hi Bill.'\n'How are you:'\n'Very well, thanks. What's up?'\nSo far so breezy. Being breezy with Bill is like whistling in the dark when\nyou know there's a ravenous Doberman somewhere in the vicinity. It does-\nn't do any good, but it makes you feel slightly better. His answer was chill-\ningly courteous.\n'We're coming to Europe, Felix. Soon.'\n'Oh.'\n'I thought that at least I should let you know,'\n'Great, Bill. We'll do lunch, Japanese for you, isn't it?'\n'No, that's not what I meant.'\n'Oh.'\n'I meant that we are going to launch PC magazines in Europe.'\n'Which magazines, Bill?'\n\f\n'Two of them to start.\"\n'Where, Bill?'\n'I think you can guess, Felix.'\n'Oh.'\nThe conversation was downhill all the way from there. This was a catas-\ntrophe of terrifying proportions. I knew that. And Bill knew that I knew. It\nended roughly as follows;\n'I think we should talk, Felix.'\n'Sure.'\n'We would like to buy your company. Or at least 51 per cent of it.\"\n'Oh;\n'You could be involved, with us launching in France, Germany and Britain.'\n'Uh-huh.'\n'You could even head it up,'\n'Uh-huh.'\n'I'll have Phil call you, Felix. 1\n'Sure.'\n'Do think carefully about our proposal, Felix.'\n'Sure.'\n'Together, we could conquer Europe in the PC magazine business.'\n'I'll think it about it, Bill,'\nIt was about all I did think about for the next year or two.\nSo that's how lives are altered. One phone call. A conversation that\nwould have meant nothing except to those in the personal computer publish-\ning business. To me, it meant the world crashing down about my ears.\nIt was flattering, but it meant ruin, of a kind, if I sold 51 per cent to Ziff\nDavis. It meant loss of independence. It meant that if I agreed, and Bill or\nhis CEO called me up on a Monday morning and asked me to pee in the\nblue urinal that week, then I would have to pee in the blue urinal. I would\n\f\nbe transformed into a hired gunslinger, trampling over Europe, swamping\nrival computer magazine publishers with launches of high-quality product\nbacked by huge investment.\nI would become something like a travelling salesman. A very rich travel-\nling salesman, true. But still a salesman. A hired gun.\nBut what choice did I have? Bill Ziff is not a bluffer. If he said he was\ncoming, then he was coming. Soon. If I spurned Phil's advances (Phil was\none of Bill's senior legal advisors) then I was toast.\nBecause Ziff Davis in those days were the best. Simply the best publish-\ners of PC periodicals in the world. If I was a fox, they were a tiger. And a\ntiger with huge amounts of money to call upon from their American invest-\nment-banker buddies. If they launched competing magazines against me in\nBritain, it would be like Russia invading the Isle of Wight. All over before\nit began.\nOr would it?\nBritain is not America. Britain has only sixty million souls compared to\nNorth America's three hundred million. British advertising agencies were\ninsular, awkward, cantankerous and nothing like the suavely dressed pond-\nlife I lunched with on the east and west coasts of America.\nCosts were higher in Britain for printing and paper. Salaries were cheaper.\nAs we have seen, newsstand sales were more important than subscriptions,\nunlike in America. Margins were smaller. The balance of revenues between\nadvertising and sales of copies was reversed. Advertisers tended to pay less\nper thousand readers per page; much less. Budgets were tighter. We drank\nwarm beer. And we didn't do power breakfast meetings.\nEurope was a different environment. Ziff Davis would probably think\nthat Britain (and Germany and France) were just mini-versions of the USA.\nThey would be utterly wrong. And it would take them time to find that out.\nTime would cost them money. How much money were they willing to lose?\nMaybe there was a chance. To fight. To prove I was better than them,\nbetter than anyone, in my own backyard. Maybe it wasn't totally hopeless.\nBut I needed allies. And I needed money. So I did what I never did, I got\ndown on my belly and squirmed over to see my rival, VNU, who had a fancy\noffice building several blocks away in Soho.\nHere was money - VNU were a public company. Here was international\nclout. And VNU didn't like Ziff Davis. In fact, one got the impression they\n\f\npositively disliked them. And the enemy of my enemy is my friend.  \nEspecially\nwhen my enemy is on the attack with his dagger at my throat.\nNow VNU are a decent bunch. Most Dutch people are decent. That's\nstereotypical, maybe, but it's always been my experience of them. Good\nnegotiators, good traders and nearly all straight arrows. But if I was a fox and\nZiff Davis was a tiger, then what was VNU? VNU was a woolly mammoth.\nIt was so big it didn't bother with animals that kept away from it. In a snow-\nstorm, the fox could probably snuggle in downwind of the mammoth,\nproviding it behaved itself.\nDennis Publishing and VNU got on in Britain. We poached each other's\nstaff (mostly, I poached theirs) and made orangutang breast-beating noises\nto advertisers. But, quite honestly, the two companies liked and respected\neach other. And I especially liked their CEO, Graeme Andrews.\nI filled Graeme in on the news. (I suspect he had already heard.) He was\nconcerned. Very concerned. VNU was a huge company in Holland and had\na growing worldwide business. They were bigger than Ziff Davis. Ziff could\nnever buy them, and would probably never want to buy them. But the tiger\ncould damage them in Britain and elsewhere. It would be a bloody fight and\nno quarter asked. So we talked, Graeme and I.\nA public company has to be careful. It cannot make alliances like private\ncompanies can. There are a million ways it can fall foul of the laws govern-\ning the governance of public companies. Graeme could not exactly promise\nme that VNU would join with Dennis to see the invading tiger off, but he\ncould suggest various hypothetical scenarios and leave the rest to silence  \nand\na raised eyebrow.\nI got busy. VNU got busy. I turned down Bill's offer, and I believe that\nBill was a little mystified by that decision. Together, but without colluding\n(honest!) we fought Ziff Davis on the beaches, on the landing grounds, in\nthe fields and in the streets, in the hills, in the offices of advertising agencies\nand on the newsstands of Britain.\nZiff Davis were game. They kept coming. They threw millions of dollars,\nthen more millions at their British beach head. It was awe-inspiring. They\npoached our columnists and our editors in droves. They paid a fortune to\ntheir staff and rented fabulous office space down by the river. Sales  \nincentives\nwere juicy. Their staff car park looked like an automobile show, the models\n\f\nwere so new. All that was missing were the girls in bikinis.\nThey wined and dined even tiny advertisers. They flew a half-page\nComputer Shopper advertiser down from Scotland, with his wife, and took\nthem both to the opera! British publishers had never seen anything like it. It\nwas the American Way writ large in a country one quarter the size of  \nTexas.\nI worked as I hadn't worked in years. Together with Alistair Ramsay, my\nmanaging director, and the entire Dennis computer publishing team, I used\nevery dirty trick and stratagem I could think of to attack the Ziff juggernaut.\nWe nearly had nervous breakdowns. And we spent money like water to take\nthe fight to them. We would not give in.\nAnd we won. Eventually, they folded their tents and drifted away into the\nnight. The combined forces of VNU and Dennis, with a teensy bit of help\nfrom EMAP and my friend Chris Anderson at Future, saw the buggers off.\nBut at what cost?\nAt the cost of two years' entire profits, my friends. Two years' profits is\nwhat it cost us to defeat Bill Ziff. Not just the profits from Computer  \nShopper.\nBut from the whole company. And today, knowing what I know today,\nwould I still have done it?\nNo. Absolutely not. It was stupid. Glorious, but stupid.\nI would have listened more closely to Phil and Bill. I would have negoti-\nated my balls off. I would have become 'the enemy', and I would have led the\ncharge to rip the limbs from any bastard who stood in the way of Ziff Davis\nDennis in Europe. That was going to be the name of the company: Ziff\nDavis Dennis, ZDD.\nThat's what I should have done. It doesn't pay to be a hero. But am I\nglad we did it. Yes, I'm glad. Because I proved that my own people, with\ntheir backs against the wall, facing an enemy with superior firepower and\nmassive confidence, could be slowed, stopped and, finally, beaten. It was\nexhilarating. But it was ultimately a pyrrhic victory. If my memory serves me\nright, either VNU or EMAP ended up with the remnants of Ziff Davis's two\nmagazine launches. So what?\nI'm in this business to get rich, aren't I. So what did I do it for? Was it\nbecause Bill had assumed I would be his junior partner? Was it because I\nsecretly desired to prove that, in the UK anyway, I was as good as everyone\nsaid his organisation was? Because the approaches from his people that"

I'm certain of it.\n And what of the competition you will be facing? What do I think I know\nthat might be of use? I know that you must dodge more bullets than you try\nto catch.

Balance is the key. By\n'ring fencing' all investment money for new projects and growth in your\nannual accounts, you can encourage managers to work on margin and profit\nfrom their 'ongoing' parts of the business while offering them the chance to\ngrow and take some risk. This equation requires patience and goodwill on all\nsides. But it can be done, and it works,\n3.Keep costs down.  Always. 'Overhead walks on two legs' and will eat you\nout of house and home. No company, new or old, can avoid 'Stealth' growth\nin overhead. It occurs, as it were, by osmosis. Prune overhead regularly. Stop\nonly when the pips squeak.\n4.Never delegate bonus arrangements.  I once did so, like a fool, and\ntwelve months later my company was forced to pay ludicrously high bonuses\nfor a very small improvement in profit to six senior managers. Four of them\nvoluntarily returned half of their bonuses. They knew they were not equi-\ntable. The other two insisted on keeping their bonuses. Neither of those two\nmanagers works for me today, or will ever work for me again. But it was my\nfault. I had delegated a task to them I should not have delegated.\n5.At senior level, insist on collective responsibility for bonuses.  Part  \nof\nthe annual incentive bonus for senior managers should result from their\ncombined efforts to bring home the bacon. One cannot make a senior\nmanager's whole bonus rest on this edifice. But peer pressure is a powerful\nforce. If senior managers sense one of their number is slacking and fear they\nmay all suffer for his or her transgressions, they are likely to let their  \nfeelings\nbe known. Forcefully.\n6.Praise excellent work.  But do not waste your praise on ho-hum perform-\nances as a sop. Employees respect a boss who knows the difference between\nthe mundane and the exceptional. Remember that not all employees  \nrespond\nwell to incentive bonuses or a dangled carrot of any kind. They seek recog-\nnition, not bribery.\n7.Fire malingerers, incompetents, toads and glory hounds mercilessly.\nNot only does firing them make you feel better and contribute to a more\npleasant working atmosphere, it cheers up the whole staff."

    "raw_text": "8.Turn a cold eye on company 'perks'.  These can add up to huge sums.\nWhile I am considered terribly old-fashioned on this subject, I am still uneasy\nabout company-issued credit cards; company-issued mobile telephones;\ntravel and entertainment of any stripe at the company's expense; company air\ntravel in any class but economy.\n9.Avoid all 'jollies',  the generic British term for flying the sales team to\nFlorida in winter to 'boost morale' and issue tub-thumping speeches, all of\nwhich are forgotten the second the crew hit the beach. You can't afford\n'jollies'. Ignore protestations from sales managers to the contrary. A day set\naside in a quiet environment, prepared for carefully, to assist sales teams\nimprove their presentations to clients, is sensible. As is sales training from\nreputable training agencies.\n10.Offer legal perks that you have paid for yourself to employees.  This\nsounds crazy, but it works. I allow my employees, for example, the use of my\nRolls-Royces or Bentleys for their weddings. I permit them to stay at my\nhomes around the world if they have performed well. I send every child born\nto an employee (well, I used to in the early days - there are too many of them\nnow) a massive soft toy. Such perks are legal because I paid for them myself\nfrom after-tax dollars or pounds.\n11.Set an example. If, as an owner, yon want fancy furniture in your office or\nworks of art or Persian rugs, then bloody well pay for them yourself. How can\nyou expect frugality when a junior manager, who works in a cubicle, comes to\nvisit you, knowing that the company paid for those accessories? There is noth-\ning wrong with them being there. It's who paid for them that counts.\n12.Encourage senior managers to go over annual results with you one-\non-one.   You  will learn more from  off-the-cuff remarks  and  opinions\nexpressed at one-on-one meetings while looking over financial results than\nyou will in a dozen board meetings. This tactic never fails to produce food\nfor thought, often on both sides.\n13. Back up your managers. With delegation comes responsibility. Back up\nyour managers, in public, whenever and wherever you have to. If they do not\nperform, speak seriously in private to them. If they still do not perform, fire\nthem. But do not undercut them or engage in meetings that appear to\nundercut them. Reprimand other managers who bad-mouth their peers.\nNearly everyone's ego and self-confidence is more fragile than the outside\nworld believes.\n14.Search out and promote talent.  Talent comes in all shapes and sizes\n\f\nand is often inarticulate and shy. Talent isn't necessarily the woman in the\nCalvin Klein suit who talks-the-talk and bamboozles meetings with stunning\ngraphics on her PowerPoint presentation. Talent is often to be found dressed\nin T-shirts down in the lower reaches of your organisation. Set a bounty on\ntalent among managers. When you find it, test it. Groom it. Work it until it's\nready to drop. Load it with more work and responsibilities. Praise it. Reward\nit. It will make you loads-a-money.\n15.Interview your rivals' talent.  I have never known a single person in a\nrival organisation, however well paid or cosseted, who has refused to meet\nme for a quiet drink after work. I have discovered more about what my rivals\nare up to in this manner than any other. In addition, I have often been so\nimpressed with the people I met in this way that I poached them later. No\nintelligence-gathering exercise is ever entirely wasted in business. There is\nonly so much pie. Talent bakes that pie.\n16.Discourage secrecy.  The more you take middle and senior managers\ninto your confidence, the more they will respect you and the harder they will\nwork for you. Many managers disagree with this policy. They love the feel-\ning of power that comes from knowing what others do not know. I don't\ncare about power, I care about getting rich.\n17.Save a little bit of pie for suppliers.  Save a little of the annual pie to\nwine and dine key suppliers. Or let them wine and dine you. If you like them\nenough, invite them to your home. We all remember to call often upon our\nmajor customers. But it is worth remembering suppliers. And they often\nhave important market information.\n18.Never bad-mouth rivals. It's a sign of stupidity and weakness. I try to go\nout of my way to praise my rivals when I can. Often enough they deserve praise\nand they're sure to learn about my comments sooner or Later. Why go out of\nyour way to antagonise them? (Secretly feeling sorry for them, because they do\nnot own as much of their own company as you do, is definitely permitted.)\n19.Sell early.  Real money rarely come from horsing around running an\nasset-laden business if you are an entrepreneur. You are not a manager,\nremember? You are trying to get rich. Whenever the chance comes to sell an\nasset at the top of its value, do so. Things do not keep increasing in value for\never. Get out while the going is good and move on to the next venture.\nMore money is usually lost holding onto an asset than is made waiting for\nthe zenith of its value. I should know - it's my own biggest defect.\n\f\n20.Enjoy the business of making money.  The loot is only a marker. Time\ncannot be recaptured. There is no amount of pie in the world worth being\nmiserable for, day after day. If you find you dislike what you are doing, then\nsell up and change your  life. Self-imposed misery is a kind of madness. The\ncure is to get out.\n21. Never miss an opportunity to promote your asset. Try purchasing\none (or both) of my books of poetry: A Glass Half Full or Lone Wolf for\ninstance. If they are not in your local bookstore, then go to www.felixden-\nnis.com and check them out. Each contains a spoken-word CD and may well\ntransform your entire life. (Sorry, I just couldn't resist that.)\n1 5\nTHE POWER\nOF FOCUS\nThe vulgar thus through imitation err;\nAs oft the learned, by being singular;\nSo much they scorn the crowd, that if the throng\nBy chance go right, they purposely go wrong.\nALEXANDER POPE, 'AN ESSAY ON CRITICISM''\nFOCUS ON KEEPING YOUR EYE ON THE BALL\nI have been very poor the greater part of my life, and have borne it as\nwell, I believe, as most people, but I can safely say that 1 have been\nhappier every guinea I have gained. SYDNEY SMITH\nIt was Alexander Pope who wrote the immortal lines concerning learning,\nand how a little of it 'is a dangerous thing'. Much the same could be said\nabout certain people's behaviour following even the most modest success. It\nblinds them.\nAs it blinded me, on so many occasions that I am loath to dredge them\nfrom my memory. But dredge them I shall. What happens? One makes\na little money by scoring a lucky goal, and suddenly you aspire to become\na god of soccer - the next Pele or Georgie Best or Diego Maradona. You\nlose focus.\nWhat is it you are attempting to achieve here? You are trying to become\nrich. This must be the main focus of your business life. Becoming rich. Not\nbecoming one of the world's most famous athletes, or taking on Rupert\n\f\nMurdoch in the newspaper publishing and television business, or having\nyour name appear a thousand times when you type it into a Google search.\nYou want to get rich. And you want to do it legally and as quickly as\nyou can.\nThat is what we are supposed to be about. Unfortunately, as John Lennon\npointed out, our lives are 'what happen while we're busy making other plans'.\nAnd that is precisely what happened to me and a great many other people I\nknow. We forgot we were supposed to concentrate on getting rich and\nconcentrated, instead, upon excelling in the first sphere we succeeded in.\nWhy am I a magazine publisher? Is it because I love magazines? No. It's\nbecause I had a tiny success back in 1967 selling a hippy magazine on\nLondon's Fashionable King's Road. That's right. I discovered that at two\nshillings and sixpence a time (half for me, half for the owner, Richard  \nNeville),\nI could earn more money than I could as an R&B drummer or a high-street-\nstore window dresser.\nI even learned that by dressing up one or two girlfriends in the shortest\nskirts they owned and instructing them to approach every guy under thirty\nwith a big smile and the following words: 'Hi! Have you got your copy of\nOZ this month yet?' I could, triple my earnings. (Some wits might say that\nhaving created the world's biggest men's lifestyle magazine, Maxim, I'm still\nat the same old game. Well, let 'em say it.)\nIt was nothing unusual for me to return to Richard Neville's basement\nflat in the King's Road days to divvy up the loot and discover a hundred\npounds in my satchel. A hundred pounds! In those days, nobody I knew had\never earned a hundred pounds in a fortnight. I could earn it in a day or so.\nAnd so I became a magazine publisher. That was OK, but I forgot to\nkeep my eye on the ball. The ball was to get rich. Instead, I decided to\nbecome one of the world's best magazine publishers. Not smart.\nWhy wasn't it smart? It took me way too long, for one thing, and it cut\nme off from more lucrative endeavours for another. I became a multi-\nmillionaire in 1982. By then I was thirty-five years old. Barmy! By thirty-\nfive\nI was already half dead.\nWith my talents I could have been a multi-millionaire by the time I was\ntwenty-five or twenty-eight. All that was stopping me was my conviction\nthat I was a born magazine publisher. How stupid, I wasted eight or nine\n\f\nyears when I could have been drinking Petrus, swilling down Retsina and\nlager instead.\nThe truth is I led myself to believe I had fallen in love with publishing.\nThat wasn't a tragedy in itself, but I allowed my liking for the magazine\npublishing business to bunker me from so many other avenues where I could\nhave coined cash.\nIf you have entrepreneurial flair, then you can go into just about any\nbusiness and make money. But instead of rushing to where the money was,\nI kept on digging in the relatively poor pit of ink-on-paper until the money,\nreluctantly, came to me.\nThis is so important, gentle reader. It pains me to think about it. If you\nwish to become rich, look carefully about you at the prevailing industries\nwhere wealth appears to be gravitating. THEN GO TO WHERE THE\nMONEY IS! That is where you should focus your efforts. On the ball\nmarked 'The Money is Here.'\nLet us say I had done something worthwhile with my life, which I have\ngood reason to doubt, and had raised a son or daughter. Would I allow either\nof them to go into the magazine business today? You must be joking.\nWhat is the magazine, business? It is a business where our main, activity is\nchopping down millions and millions of trees, flattening the pulp and print-\ning hieroglyphics and images on both sides of it. Then we send the end prod-\nuct out in diesel-guzzling trucks to shops where perhaps 60 per cent of them\nsell to customers. We then pile the remaining, unsold magazines into more\ndiesel-guzzling trucks and take them to a plant where they are either\nconsumed as fuel, buried or shredded, or used to make cardboard boxes for\nrefrigerators. That's the magazine business.\nDoes this sound to you like a great business? Of course it isn't. Do you\nimagine I would allow any grown child of mine to go into such a business?\nOf course I wouldn't. The magazine business will have faded to a shadow of\nits former glory within a decade or three. It is a mature business, and few\nfortunes are made in mature industries, unless you are lucky enough to\ncreate a monopoly in one. I was luckier than I knew.\nSo what businesses should I have gravitated towards? Computer soft-\nware, technology and dot com start-ups, cable and satellite television, prop-\nerty, environmental waste clean-up, alternative energy services ... any one\nof these might have created a much larger fortune for me in less time than\nI took with magazines. Do I know anything about these industries? No.\nBut, then, I didn't know anything about magazines in 1967 either.\n\f\nSo this is the first lesson in the power of focus. Keep your eye on the ball\nif you wish to get rich. And do not forget which ball.\nIt's the one marked 'The Money is Here.'\nTIMING\nThe time you won your town the race\nWe chaired you through the market-place;\nMan and boy stood cheering by,\nAnd home we brought you shoulder-high.\nA. E. HOUSMAN, 'To AN ATHLETE DYING YOUNG'\nThere is no substitute for good timing. There is always luck involved, but it's\noften the kind of luck you help make yourself.\nWith my friend Don Atyeo, I wrote two biographies many years ago. The\nfirst one was about the martial artist and film star, Bruce Lee. We received a\npitiful advance from a very small firm in London called Wildwood House\nrun by a publisher of the old school, Oliver Caldecott. Oliver was a kindly\nsoul, and he thought he might just be able to sell a few thousand copies of\nwhat would be the first biography written about Bruce Lee. Lee was a cult\nfigure in Hong Kong and the UK at the time.\nDon Atyeo and I were broke. We knew nothing whatever about kung-fu\nand nothing about Bruce Lee. Neither of us were film buffs. Neither of us\nhad ever written a book before. Our only qualifications for this task were as\nfollows: 1) It was our idea. 2) We owned a typewriter each. 3) We had visited\nAsia. 4) We were broke.\nOur contract with Wildwood House gave Oliver rights to publish our\nbiography in Hong Kong, Britain, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. No\nother territories were mentioned in his contract because it was inconceivable\nthat the book would ever be published or wanted in them.\nDon and I buried ourselves in research. We visited Hong Kong (on a\nshoestring budget) and got a lot of interview material (including, incredibly,\nan interview with Bruce Lee himself), and then we sat down in my Soho flat\nin London and began typing. Typing, rather than writing, would be the\noperative description.\nThis was hack work of the most demeaning kind. But it was fun and we\nneeded the money. Then good timing arrived. Good timing for us, that is.\n\f\nBruce Lee died suddenly and unexpectedly in Hong Kong in July 1973.\nOvernight, he became a global superstar. And we had almost finished his\nbiography - the only biography then written about him.\nThe world erupted in Bruce Lee mania. His films began playing to\npacked audiences in scores of countries. For a brief moment, he was the  \nmost\nfamous man on the planet. Most movies appeal only to movie-goers in one\nor two continents, but Bruce Lee became a star not only in Europe and\nNorth America, but in Africa, South America, India, Central America, the\nMiddle East and Asia.\nAt my request, Don leaped on a flight to Hong Kong. A flight we could\nnot afford. Oliver loaned us the money. There, Don got the lowdown from\nthe hospital where Lee had died, interviewed surgeons and nurses there and\nwent on to obtain interviews with Bruce Lee's mistress and minders and\npieced together what had happened on the night Lee died.\nIt was an explosive story, and all the more compelling because his death\nwas considered suspicious by many of his fans. Meanwhile, Lee's movie\ncompany Golden Harvest, run by Raymond Chow, together with Lee's wife,\nLinda, were concocting a smokescreen designed to protect the filmstar's\nreputation. This was understandable (he had died in his mistress's apart-\nment) but rumours of criminal and even supernatural involvement in his\ndeath swirled around Hong Kong.\nEventually, these rumours reached the outside world. The result was an\ninternational media firestorm.\nWhen famous people die, there are always rumours which coalesce into\nconspiracy theories. It's just human nature. In Bruce Lee's case, this \nspeculation\nreached absurd levels and only served to heighten worldwide interest in his\nmovies. In the Western world, Don Atyeo and Felix Dennis, two hard-up\nhippies living in a slum in central London, now became Bruce Lee 'experts'.\nHey! Compared to the hundreds of other journalists assigned to the\nstory from around the world, we were experts. No sooner had Don flown,  \nout\nof Hong Kong, interview tapes and photographs bulging in his luggage,\nthan a well-oiled machine rolled into place. Golden Harvest's machine. And\nMr Chow was one of the most powerful men in Hong Kong. The worldwide\nmedia circus arrived too late.\n\f\nJournalists from newspapers in every capital city in the Western world\ncould find no one to interview. Lee's wife, his mistress, Betty Ting Pei, his\nproducers, his housekeepers, his drivers, his studio colleagues, the hospital\nstaff and anyone connected with Bruce Lee and his movie company\nclammed up. Our timing had been perfect. We had slipped in and out\n'under the radar'.\nWe finished the book in record time and Wildwood House published\nBruce Lee: King of Kung-Fu in the UK to the delight of legions of ecstatic\nBruce Lee fans. It went straight into the British non-fiction bestsellers list.\nFor the first rime, Wildwood House had a bestseller on their hands. And\nDon and I had money in our pocket.\nBut there was far more money to come from this splendid piece of good\ntiming - unless you happened to be Bruce Lee. I realised I owned the rights\nto our biography in many countries around the world - all of Europe, Africa,\nCentral and South America, the Middle East, most of Asia and, most\ncrucially of all, the USA. In addition, because my little company had\ndesigned the book, we had the negatives and typesetting on hand. Together\nwith an old friend and lawyer, Andrew Fisher, as well as book agents Abner\nStein and Nat Sobel, I got busy.\nThe result was a river of coin flowing into Don's pockets, my pockets,\nAndrew's pockets, the agents' pockets and my company's pockets from\nforeign edition after foreign edition of our book. There were translations into\nGerman, French, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Greek, Arabic, Spanish and a\nhost of others. It also meant I got to meet up with a hero of mine again, Jann\nWenner, who had founded Rolling Stone, the American music magazine.\nJann's book publishing division, Straight Arrow, bought the US rights.\nThe book there was re-designed by Jon Goodchild, the very man who had\ntaught me to design magazines in the early days of OZ in London, who was\nnow living in San Francisco. Bruce Lee: King of Kung-fu flew off the\nshelves in North America. I'm told it was one of Straight Arrow's best-\nselling books ever.\nIt was perched on Bruce Lee's metaphorical shoulders that I first tasted\nreal money and built my first successful business, including a raft of kung-fu\nmagazines and Bruce Lee commemorative mail-order items, masterminded\nby my old school friend, Bruce Sawford. Bruce had a lot of experience in\nmail order.\nIn the latter part of 1973 and through 1974, the post office delivered\nmore than one thousand sacks of mail to our ramshackle office. The postmen\n\f\n(there were no women delivering mail in those days) got so pissed off with\nthe number of sacks, they refused to carry them upstairs to our garret office\nand dumped them in the hall. On a good day there would be six sacks. Each\nsack would contain envelopes with postal orders, cheques or money worth\n$10,000 or more. Every day.\nThen more good timing. A television presenter ranted and raved on her\nshow on national UK television about one particular Bruce Lee commem-\norative item sold by my company. It was called the Bruce Lee Treasure Kit,\nand she thought it poor value for money. In tones resembling the\nannouncement of the death of a family member (she was a sanctimonious\nphony if you ask me) this showbiz hack removed each of the items from the\nbag containing the Treasure Kit and showed them to the camera. There\nwere maybe eight items, including a membership card to the British Bruce\nLee Society, photographs, a couple of badges and stickers, and a bunch of\nother stuff.\nThe next day, thousands more orders for the Treasure Kit came pouring\nin our garret door. We actually went round to the post office ourselves and\nhelped the postmen lug them up the street on hand carts. In those sacks  \nwas\na small fortune, and I didn't want them lying around the post office sorting\nrooms too long.\nHere is the power of timing. Don and I were not great writers, although\nwe improved as time went by. We were not investigative journalists. My\ncompany was a hole-in-the-wall operation barely capable of publishing a\nseries of pamphlets, let alone a stable of magazines. Wildwood House was\nnot a home of bestsellers. We were broke. We were inexperienced. And yet,\nwe made a ton of money.\nNot everyone who wants to get rich is going to get lucky with their\ntiming. But what made the timing so good in our case? Three things, I think.\nOne was the blind luck of one of the fittest men in the world keeling over\nand dying. (If you want to know what he died of, then buy a second-hand\ncopy of our book. And don't believe anyone else. We really did those inter-\nviews with the hospital surgeons and staff and so we didn't have to make tip\nconspiracy nonsense concerning 'bad feng shui' and Triad plots.)\nSecondly, we followed our instincts and we persisted with this mad idea,\ndespite our lack of experience or any credentials. But then, who did have the\ncredentials?\n\f\nThirdly, we acted with extraordinary speed. We put ourselves in the right\nplaces at the right time, and we never slowed down from the moment Bruce\nLee died. Within weeks, we had finished a book, sold lots of foreign\nlanguage editions, sold the US publishing rights, published a ton of maga-\nzines, invented a lot of mail-order items and then manufactured and sold\nthem to tens of thousands of fans.\nAnd what did it all add up to? It added up to focus, following a stroke of\nluck in the shape of perfect riming.\nWhat errors did I make? Plenty, I did not invent enough magazines and\nI did not invent enough commemorative items early on. Within a year or\ntwo, my company was organising 'Bruce Lee Memorial Conferences' and\neven sending fans on 'Pilgrimage Tours' to Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific\nairline. It was profitable business. But if I had managed to do those things\nwithin six months, I would have made for more money.\nWhat other errors? I did not write and publish another book. I had enough\nmaterial to have done so. I could easily have asked a couple of journalist friends\nto ghost it for Don and me for a pittance. It would have been another best-\nseller for sure. But, by then, I had fallen into a trap. I believed I was a biogra-\npher. I believed that our biography was a great biography. What nonsense.\nWhat I should have done was published a book, with Wildwood House\nor any other book publisher, called Who Killed Bruce Lee? And this time, I\nshould have insisted on having my company named as joint publisher. Such\na book, produced swiftly enough, would have sold millions of copies around\nthe world.\nMy errors came party from inexperience and partly from falling into the\ntrap that I mentioned earlier. They also came from lack of focus. I was allow-\ning my thoughts to wander towards expanding in new directions, mostly\nmagazines, while there was soil a cow in the shape of a new book bursting\nwith milk and waiting to be milked. That was a serious error. A loss of focus.\nWho knows? Perhaps I will milk it one day, but it will never yield the\nsmall fortune that would have resulted from a ghosted piece of exploitation\npublished in 1974.\nFOCUS ON CREATING THE RIGHT ENVIRONMENT\nI was the better at getting and keeping,\nYou were the better at spend and spend;\n\f\nI was the better at grubbing and heaping,\nBut who was the better man in the end?\nYes, who was the better man, my friend?\nWho was the better man?\nTHE BETTER MAN'\nYou cannot get rich all on your own. No one can. You have to create, or\nwork within, the right environment.\nHumans are a cooperative, if argumentative, race. If you were to be\nboycotted by your immediate neighbours, if nobody would meet with you\nor take your instructions or sell you anything or buy anything from you, you\ncould never make money. You cannot do it on your own. Getting rich is\nmostly sleight of hand, but if you acquire no audience but a mirror, then\nthere is no illusion with which to get rich.\nPaper money itself is an illusion. It is a promise from a man you will never\nmeet, who works for a bank you will probably never enter, who reports to a\ngovernment you do not control. A £50 note or $100 bill is just a piece of\npaper with some fancy printing on both sides of it. And what is a credit card\nbut a small rectangle of plastic with which you promise to buy a watch, car,\na yacht or even a house?\nWhen you bank or spend paper money or use a credit card, you do so as\nan implied part of a collective illusion. You already subscribe to what Charles\nMackay once rightly called 'a popular delusion' or 'the madness of crowds'.\nYou cannot use such devices alone. Others must believe in them equally for\nthe magic to function.\nWhen enough people share a short-lived delusion, vast sums of money\ncan be acquired overnight. The 'tulip mania' in Holland in the mid-seven-\nteenth century was such a time. Tulips had been imported into Holland for\nforty years before the madness hit. By 1635, a single tulip bulb was swapped\nfor a collection of valuable articles, which included the following:\nO four tons of wheat\nO  eight tons of rye\nO a bed\nO four oxen\n\f\nO eight pigs\nO  a suit of clothes\nO  two caskets of wine\nO four tonnes of beer\nO two tons of butter\nO one thousand pounds of cheese\nO a silver drinking cup\nThe current value of the above would be $50,000 or more. And this was for a\nsingle tulip bulb! Fortunes were made or lost, especially the latter, when the\nmusic stopped. Within a few years, a tulip bulb was worth less than a dollar in\ntoday's money. Here is the wonder of collective short-term delusion writ  \nlarge.\nIn the same way, it is almost impossible to build an individual fortune\nwithout colleagues, confederates and one or two professionals on board. You\nwill need a lawyer, sooner or later. You will be a fool to set up in business\nwithout a qualified accountant somewhere in the picture. You will need\nothers who believe in your idea or your talent to work with you and for  \nyou.\nI suppose there is a 'James Bond' type scenario where an evil genius can\nwork with a computer hitched up to the internet and steal all the world's\nmoney alone. But I doubt this is a part of your own game plan. In any case,\neven the evil genius will need someone to guard the gold bars while he  \nworks\nhis evil on the computer, to make him the computer in the first place so that\nhe can be evil, invent the internet to allow his evil to spread, force millions of\nothers to use the internet as victims of his evil and hire minions to pump  \nout\nthe evil lavatory when the evil sewage pipe blocks.\nYou see? You just can't do it on your own. You need to create an\nenvironment.\nThis does not mean you require fancy offices and all the accoutrements.\nHuman capital is by far the most important element of your environment,\nwhether you are just starring up or deep into the game. By focusing hard on\nobtaining that human capital you will vastly increase your chances of becom-\ning rich."

What you need are clever,\ncunning and adept people.\nBut why would clever, cunning and adept people work for a mug like\nyou? Simple. There are many clever, cunning and adept people who are risk\naverse. You are not risk averse because you are dedicated to becoming rich.\nBelieve it or not, much, much cleverer people than you will come and work\nfor you if you ask them.\nYou don't believe me?

    "raw_text": "Get\nothers to interview them or talk to them as well, either with you or sepa-\nrately. We are all far too fond of choosing those we instinctively like, those\nwe respect or believe are similar to ourselves. This is not a good thing. You\nneed the input of others to choose the right candidate, although the final\nchoice, in the early days, must be yours and yours alone.\nO Go further than reading a person's references.  It's such a fag, such  \na\nbloody nuisance, such a pain in the neck, to go well beyond the references\nand CV you've received, isn't it? And yet it pays. Make an appointment with\na potential employee's last company or with a supplier's other customers. Go\nand see someone there. Make nicey-nicey. Listen hard. You will discover\nmore about your potential employee or supplier in a few minutes in this way\nthan in hours of conversation with them.\nYou can even tell the prospective employee or supplier you have\ndone so if you wish. It cuts bullshit down to a minimum. And it shows, at\nthe same time, that you cared enough to go beyond a CV and the usual\nreferences.\nO Make notes. Speak little.  I'm terrible at this. Absolutely terrible. But\nI've learned to try harder as the years have gone by. Your notes need not  \nrefer\nin any way to what the potential employee or supplier is saying. It can be\ngibberish. Or it can, more usefully, be your impressions of the person and\ntheir responses. Have a series of questions handy to shoot out when they\ngrind to a halt. Then focus like mad on what your instinct and your  \nintuition\nis telling you - as well as your ears.\nAs to speaking little yourself, remember you are being interviewed, too.\nIt is impossible for the other side to tell that you are not as clever as they are\nif you keep your mouth shut. 'Better to have the world suspect you a fool\nthan to open your mouth and put the matter beyond doubt,' as the old\nsaying has it.\nIt may appear rude to have initiated a conversation, as you have, and not\nto make small-talk to fill in embarrassing silences. But you are not conducting\nthe conversation to be polite. You are conducting the conversation to get rich.\nO Good suppliers respect attention to detail.  Don't hesitate to  \nchallenge\nquotes or invoices - after you have done your homework. At the beginning\n\f\nof\na relationship, everything will usually be hunky-dory. Later, hidden or unac-\nceptable costs may creep in. Challenge them. Constantly request quotes from\nyour supplier's rivals. Demand refunds if a supplier screws up, based not on  \nthe\ncost of the goods or services, but the financial consequences of the screw-up.\n(I've read acres of New Age rubbish about 'partnerships' between suppli-\ners and customers. That's what it is: rubbish. If I could only get rich by bank-\nrupting every supplier I ever dealt with, then I would do it in a heartbeat. I\nwouldn't feel good about doing it, but I'd do it. Getting rich isn't about\nvendor-customer 'partnerships'. And anyway, I have found that good suppli-\ners respect a hard-nosed attitude providing it's logical and providing you pay\non time.)\nO Pay employees well. Bonus better.  Even young children know what\nyou get when you pay peanuts. Monkeys! Your company's salaries must be\ncompetitive.\nBonuses should be more than competitive, they should be tempting,\ngenerous and based ruthlessly on meritocracy and delivery. That's the way to\nget employees to really focus. You don't want people to apply to work for\nyou because of the salaries on offer - they should be driven by other desires.\nBut if a salary isn't commensurate with the market, potential winners will not\nbe able to afford to work for you. I made that error for some years before\nchanging my ways.\nO Be alert for 'cross overs'.  Many times I have been interviewing some-\none for a job and realised that they are not suitable for the job in question.\nHowever, the candidate would be perfect in another position in my\ncompany. Never mind that that position is currently filled. (All positions in\nyour company, except your own, are temporary.)\nThese 'cross overs' occur often. Be alert for them. Nothing pleases a\ncandidate who has failed to get a particular job more than being contacted\nsome time later and offered a job out of the blue. It is like a vindication and\nthey will almost certainly say 'yes' if the job title and money matches or\nexceeds their current position.\nO Only hire winners.  There may or may not be such a thing as bad luck.\nBut whether it exists or not, it is certainly contagious! Hire winners or people\nyou believe will become winners. Fire whiners and moaners swiftly. That's\ncontagious, too. You are trying to create an environment where making\nmoney is on everyone's mind most of the time. Losers and whiners usually\n\f\nhave other priorities.\nO Ignore your prejudices, likes and dislikes.  Easy to say and hard to do.\nLegally, you may not permit certain prejudices to colour your choice regard-\ning any candidate. This is not only good law, it's good sense. Some of the\nmost successful colleagues and employees who have worked with me and for\nme over the years were not my personal cup of tea at the beginning.\nLikes and dislikes should not come into it. Loyalty, effectiveness,\nhonesty, integrity and stamina are crucial. Cleverness and cunning can be\nuseful. Professionalism is vital. A desire to shine in the world is worth more\nthan a university degree. All of this is important. Who you like and don't like\nis irrelevant. If an employee makes money for you, you'll get to like them\nlater, I promise.\nO Promote from within when you can.  I recently had to hire a new CEO\nfor one of my companies. An old friend, an ex-CEO and chairman of one of\nmy rivals, Robin Miller, gave me a great piece of advice. He suggested that\nan external candidate, a candidate from outside the company looking for a\nsenior position, had better be at least 30 per cent better than any internal\ncandidates to get the job.\nWhy? Because, he reminded me, you know all the faults of an internal\ncandidate - they may have worked for you for years. But external candidates\ncome to you free from errors made in the past. All you are faced with is an\nimpression at the meeting and a list of their achievements. Failures are not a\npart of anyone's CV. It was good advice from Robin, and just tipped the\nbalance in my mind when I made my own final decision.\nO Don't leave senior employees in any job too long.  If this happens, as\nit has in my companies occasionally, it means you are not focusing on that\nbusiness. You will get the most out of any senior employee in their first year\nor two in a new position. After that, they enter a 'comfort zone'.\nDo you really want them to be comfortable? If a man or woman heads up\none of your companies and has been there too long, consider asking them to\ncreate a new division or company for you. But do not leave them to quietly\ngo to seed - they will get bored and resign anyway, if they're any good.\nFOCUS ON DOING AN OUTSTANDING JOB\nIndeed the Idols I have loved so long\nHave done my credit in this World much wrong;\n\f\nHave drowned my Glory in a shallow Cup,\nAnd sold my Reputation for a Song.\nEDWAXD FITZGERALD, THE RUBAIYAT OF OMAR KHAYYAM  OF NAISHAPUR\nIf on my deathbed I had only a very short time to pass on what wisdom\nI have accumulated about getting rich to a son or daughter, then it would\nbe this:\nOwnership Shall Re Half of the Law;\nDoing an Outstanding Job Shall Be The Other Half.\nThere is no point in owning 100 per cent of a rubbish company. Whatever\nit is you intend to do to get rich, get good at it. Hire people who are better\nthan you at it. Listen and learn and get better still at it.\nEven if you produce garbage for morons to watch on television, make it\nthe most entertaining garbage out there. Even if you are nothing but a scum-\nsucking, ambulance-chasing tort lawyer - the lowest form of pond-life that\nwalks on its hind legs - be the best scum-sucking ambulance-chaser in town.\nThe American gangster Al Capone is said to have shot a man who kept\nbrewing rotten beer for Capone's illegal beer-distribution racket during\nProhibition. His gang lieutenants didn't get it. The business was illegal\nanyway. If a new supplier tried to muscle in with better beer, they would\nmurder him. What did it matter if the beer was crap? But Capone, who\nwould have become one of America's greatest businessmen if he had stayed\non the straight and narrow, knew better.\nHe knew that rotten beer makes rotten business. He refused to have his\nname associated with rubbish. He expected Prohibition to be lifted eventu-\nally, and hoped to be the legal beer king of America. Of course, he never did\nbecause he didn't pay his taxes and because he was a murderer and a vicious,\nbrutal killer.\nEven so, I am ashamed to say that if the above story is true, then I admire\nCapone for the sentiment, if not for his business methods. He was right\nabout the beer. Having read his autobiography, I found myself wishing he\nhad stayed out of the rackets and built his fortune legally. He had many of\nthe attributes of a world-class entrepreneur. I suspect he would have become\nvery rich indeed without having to resort to crime.\nWhy does it count? Why is it important to focus on doing an outstand-\ning job?\n\f\nFirstly, talent will flock to your company. Talented employees mean you have\nmore opportunities to make more money. Secondly, you will make fewer \nerrors.\nThe quality of your management will see to that. Thirdly, it places a premium\non your assets and the worth of your business. That means you get richer \nfaster.\nFourthly, it's simply more enjoyable - which means you will enjoy coining to\nwork and will spend more time focusing on doing an even better job.\nSo focus on your business, whatever it is. It represents what you are. It\nshould be a source of pride as well as a source of money. Being the best, or\nat least striving to be, will speed up the process of getting rich. Trust me. I'm\nthe best damn magazine publisher in England. (Well, at least I strive to be!)\nFocusing on doing an outstanding job is an important part of getting rich.\n\f\nPART FOUR\nT R O U B L E -\nSHOOTING\n&  E N D G A M E"

    "raw_text": "1 6\nWHOOPS!\nBeing young is greatly overrated.\nAny failure seems so total. Later on,\nyou realise you can have another go.\nMARY QUANT, FASHION DESIGNER.\nAN OWNER'S GUIDE TO KNOWING WHEN\nTO CUT AND RUN\nAnd this is the law, I will maintain.\nUnto my dying day, sir,\nThat whatsoever king shall reign,\nI will be the Vicar of Bray, sir!\nTRADITIONAL ENGLISH FOLK-SONG\nI do not believe the words 'a patient man' would necessarily spring to the\nlips of those who know me superficially. 'Irascible' would be more likely.  \nBut\nI can be as patient as the next man, and a great deal more so, when it comes\nto projects I believe will make me money.\nStill, not all things work out. Nor do most of us have the time or the\ninclination to conduct a full autopsy on what went wrong. Past failures are\nnot pleasant to contemplate. But if you intend becoming wealthy by owning\na company or some similar entity, then, sooner or later, you will encounter\nfailure. It would be wise, at that time, to figure out just what went wrong.\nA failure in the offing represents one of the only times that minority\nshareholders or minority investors become a potential boon. If you can\noffload your share of a failing company on them and shimmy out the door,\nthen you should certainly do so. They may be prepared to take over and\nattempt themselves to make a success from your failure.\nMost people close very few companies or projects in their lift and they are\noften unaware of closure costs. They nearly always underestimate them. The\nmagazine business will provide a classic example which may surprise you.\nBelieve it or not, there are magazines that have been propped up on life-\n\f\nsupport by large publishing companies for years. The executives will be fully\naware that their magazine is not viable and will never be viable. Let us say  \nit\nis losing $3 million a year. Why not close it without further ado?\nThe answer is closing costs. The hidden cost of failure.\nIn our example, the cost of shutting down the magazine will far exceed\nthe three million it costs to keep the wretched rag just breathing. Why so?\nBecause magazines sell large numbers of subscriptions to readers. In\nAmerica, these 'subs' are often sold at a knockdown price to encourage the\nappearance to advertisers and others of growth. It is a foolish practice, but it\nis ubiquitous.\nEven if the magazine's 'subs' price is a reasonable one, there have been\nnumerous cases of a form of petty 'bribery' where potential subscribers are\nwooed by publishers to subscribe with the offer of a free clock-radio or\nreduced memberships to health clubs, etc. These cheap prices and free gifts'\ncreate a massive liability in the publisher's balance sheet - which is fine as\nlong as advertising continues to pour in. But when the magazine is no  \nlonger\nflavour-of-the-month and advertising is falling off, the misery begins.\nLet us say a dying magazine has a million subscribers. Most of them are\nnot 'real' subscribers, but, even so, they have paid their dollar per copy and\nare owed, on average, six more issues. This means the cost of reimbursing\nthe subscribers alone will exceed $6 million in refunds. (It will exceed it, by\nthe way, because of the huge cost of collating and mailing the refunds to a\nmillion people.)\nOf course, the publisher will also face other closure costs, including\nredundancy payments to magazine staff, rebates to advertisers and possibly\nto printers and paper merchants and a host of other creepy-crawlies that\nwill come slithering out of the woodwork when news that the ship is sink-\ning spreads abroad. In all, sudden-death closure costs might be as high as\n$8 million.\nThe publishers only hope is to cut costs to the bone, cease soliciting any\ndiscounted subscriptions, fulfil the subscriptions with very thin, very cheap\neditions of the magazine - now a shadow of its former self in quality and\nnumber of pages - and thereby reduce what, in the jargon, we call the 'subs\nliability'. This can only be done if the poor beast is stilt technically alive.\nIn the meantime, the publishers hope that many staff will not wait to be\n\f\nfired but will seek other jobs and reduce closure costs by reducing redun-\ndancy payments. It took one of the largest magazine-publishing corporations\nin America over five years to bring about the closure of what was then still\none of the best-known magazines in the world. It lost money for every one\nof those five years. Let's take a look at why.\nOver five years, in our hypothetical example, losses would total $15\nmillion - surely more than the cost of instantly shooting the brute? Yes, but\nthat $15 million will have been spread out over those five years. The parent\ncompany can afford to carry such a burden. Profits will only be slightly\naffected each year and senior executives will still receive their precious  \nannual\nbonuses. Even better, the share price will suffer mildly, if at all. On the other\nhand, if the full $8 million (or more) for sudden-death was charged in a\nsingle year, not only would the senior management's bonuses evaporate\n(horror of horrors!), the share price would probably take a hit from negative\npublicity and profit-and-loss considerations.\nBut how can it be good for a company to waste the difference between\n$8 million and $15 million for an asset going nowhere? The medium- or\nlong-term answer is that it isn't good. The company will have squandered $7\nmillion (more, with inflation taken into consideration) and clogged up its\nmanagerial focus with a deadbeat property. But the short-term answer is that\nit's probably the best thing to do in the circumstances. Not to mention that\nin larger corporations, the short term is often the only term senior manage-\nment, goaded on by share price 'analysts', can bring itself to care about.\nI mention all this just to give you a sense of what failure tastes like and a\nglimpse at the hidden costs of closure. If there is any way at all you can play\n'pass the parcel' with a venture you believe is destined to fail and in which\nyou are a principal, then do not hesitate. Pass the damn parcel and move on\nto the next opportunity.\nBut how can you know when things are going to fail? You cannot.\nNobody has 20/20 future vision. But if you are running the business, you\nwill certainly know much earlier than anyone else. Providing you are willing\nto stare reality in the face, that is, which many executives and entrepreneurs\nare not.\nI'm now going to give you a piece of obvious advice. Listen closely to\nyour bean-counters and accountants. Or seek one out you trust when the\nwhiff of failure is in the air and get advice. They are a much-maligned  \ngroup,\n\f\nbean-counters. It is true that they are risk averse to an extraordinary degree,\nand that if bean-counters ruled the world we would be permitted to produce\nnothing but beans, just to be on the safe side. But they also have professional\ntraining. And many of them have seen financial failure before and know that\nthe light at the end of the tunnel is probably an oncoming train. If you listen\nvery carefully and are careful, too, to mask your irritation at their litany of\nhard facts, you might save yourself a small fortune.\nThere are incompetent and even crooked bean-counters, of course, and\nI have, sadly, employed one or two of them. But on the whole, I wish I had\nlistened more often and more carefully to their advice in my business life.\nWhen the going is getting rough, when there is a scent of rotting fish in the\nair, they are right more often than they are wrong. Curse them.\nAll very well, but how can you know when things are soon to collapse\nabout your ears and what can you do if, having followed my instructions to\nthe letter, you are the sole owner of your little company? Not a lot, but we'll\ntake a shot at it.\nBooks on management theory at this point normally advise you not to\npanic. I don't agree with that. It's my belief that adrenaline and a touch of\npanic are tremendous motivators. Of course, you can't stay in a panic, but\na dose of panic in a private place, with a bottle of malt whisky on one hand\nand a bean-counter on the other, can be a very motivational experience.\nMotivational and salutary.\nBut never despair. We are not engaged upon a serious business here. We\nare only talking about the getting of money, and, occasionally, the losing of\nmoney. You may despair when you have broken your neck; you may  \ndespair\nwhen your only child has predeceased you; you may despair when terrible\nwars, famines or plagues afflict millions of innocents. But you must not\ndespair over a simple thing like money. Take a shot of comfort from poetry\n- here are three stanzas from Arthur Hugh Clough's poem, 'Say Not the\nStruggle Nought Availeth':\nSay not the struggle nought availetb,\nThe labour and the wounds are vain,\nThe enemy faints not, not faileth,\nAnd as things have been they remain.\nIf hopes were dupes, fears may be liars;\nIt may be, in yon smoke concealed."

And his point about the smoke of battle obscuring the landscape is well\nmade. So what are we to do? Or, rather, what are you to do?\nFirstly, you must see how much time is left. In the days of the dot com\nboom they used to call this your 'burn rate'. (At what rate were the dot com\nbandits and entrepreneurs burning through the money provided to them by\nmisguided saps who trusted and believed in them? When would they go bust\nor need more money?)\nOnce you have established just how long you can continue to trade with-\nout falling into the technical trap of illegal trading (which you must not do,\nmy friend), you should make an inventory. And I do not mean an inventory\nof your office furniture, computer systems (you will have spent far too much\non those items, I will wager) or your piles of unused stationery.\nYou need to analyse the beast you had hoped would make you money.\nJust like those brilliant software designers, who invent software that \nsolves no\nknown problem and must then search for or invent a problem for their  \nsoft-\nware to solve, so you must consider whether your beast would make  \nmoney\nin another man's kennel.\nMight it have uses that you have not yet considered? Might it be a\nmoney-maker if it was viewed in another light? This is more often the \ncase\nthan you might suppose.\nTake the story of Ray Kroc, founder of the McDonald's fast-food chain.\nHe bought McDonald's, an uninspiring, no-hum burger business,  \nbecause\nhe realised, in a flash of astonishing intuition, that what Americans on  \nthe\nroad needed was not fine cuisine or the best burger money could buy.\n\f\nWhat\nAmericans wanted, as they travelled vast distances across interstate \nhighways,\nwas consistency, cleanliness and fast service.\nThey didn't care if the burger was a mediocre burger. All they cared\nabout was being certain they would be served the same burger they\nconsumed in the last McDonald's they visited, perhaps hundreds of  \nmiles\naway. Swift service, a clean environment and consistency. That was the \nsecret\nof one of the most astonishing business success stories in American \nhistory.\nKroc was viewing an existing product in a different light.\nKroc did not invent the hamburger. He saw that hamburger outlets\ncould become a different beast from other fast-food outlets at the time.\nMcDonald's is only called McDonald's today by an accident. It would  \nnot\nreally have mattered which burger business Kroc had decided to  \npurchase.\nHis genius lay not in producing a burger, but in allaying Americans'  \nfears\nthat the next place they stopped at for fast food might poison them, or\ncharge exorbitant prices, or make them wait an instant longer than was\nnecessary. (This tale is simplified. The business of creating franchises \nalso had\na great deal to do with Kroc's success. But the analogy holds true.)\nSo look at your own, ailing beast. Can it be something else? Can you\nmake it a tiger of a different stripe, or can somebody else? Is it really  \nnot a\nvalid business? Would more capital help, or would that be throwing  \ngood\nmoney after bad? Your analysis must be ruthless. If there is anyone with \nbusi-\nness savvy in the world you trust, now is the time to seek them out, tell \nyour\nstory and listen.\nShould you determine  that the  beast is worthless,  both to you or\nanybody else, still do not give up. At least try to sell it, I once forgot to  \ndo\n\f\nso and lost a lot of money that already had my name on it. Money that \nwas\npiled neatly in a bank waiting for me to collect it. Let me explain.\nWe once launched a magazine in Britain called Stuff. It was a big launch,\ntoo. The idea behind Stuff was that it would be like many other young \nmen's\nmagazines (zany humour, great photography of beautiful girls in \nswimsuits,\narticles stuffed with attitude), but it would also specialise in gadgets and \nnew\ntechnology. The magazine would be a shop window for the kind of guy \nwho\nalways seems to have a new gadget before you've heard of it.\nStuff was launched with great fanfare in the UK and promptly failed. It\ntook us a while to cotton on (too long, to be honest) but the writing was  \non\nthe wall.\nStuff had cost me a fortune to launch and I was angry about it. We\nshould have done better and we all knew it. I demanded it be closed at a\ntension-packed board meeting. We began preparing the closure press \nrelease\nand readying ourselves to tell the staff of Stuff the bad news. Word of \nour\ndecision leaked out around the British magazine industry. (Why is it that \nbad\nnews travels faster than the speed of light?)\nWhat happened next is the subject of dispute. I believe that I was already\nslated to have lunch with one of Britain's most amusing and canny \nmagazine\npublishers, Michael Heseltine — that's the Lord Heseltine to you,  \nchum.\nMichael had helped to found Haymarket Publishing many years before, \nafter\na career as a property developer. He then went into politics and very \nnearly\nreached the top of the greasy pole. Personally, I think Britain would be  \na\nbetter place today if he had reached it, but that's by the by.\nMichael and I always lunch in a seafood restaurant called Wilton's."

    "raw_text": "We've\nbeen doing so for years. Michael had heard that I was closing Stuff. And \nhe\nhad seen what I had not. That Stuff could be a tiger of a different stripe  \nif it\nwas published solely as a gadget magazine around the world. It didn't  \nneed\ntoo much zany humour or girls in swimsuits. They could be dispensed \nwith.\nHe made me an offer. I was caught unawares, having gone to Wilton's\nto drown my sorrows. I was also massively embarrassed, not because  \nwe\nwere going to close a magazine - we all have to do that from time to  \ntime\nin the publishing game - but because we had FORGOTTEN TO TRY  \nTO\nSELL IT.\nIt was humiliating, I could have kicked myself. I tried damage limitation\nin our 'negotiations', but Michael has negotiated with  the likes of the rulers\nof China and the USSR and he knew I was bluffing. I had no other poten-\ntial buyer. I could not create an auction. Dennis Publishing had all bar\nannounced Stuffs, closure. I was trapped and had nowhere to go.\nTo cut to the chase, Michael was very decent about it and paid me a fair\nsum for the brute. I cannot tell you how much, but I suspect it is more than\nmost individuals have earned in the last decade. Even so, it was not exactly a\nfortune. I did manage to negotiate one concession, one 'rogue element'.\nHaymarket would buy the right to publish Stuff anywhere in the world\nexcept for North, Central and South America.\nI duly launched Stuff later in the USA, where it has been a success and\nsells more than its rival, FHM. Haymarket, on the other hand, has launched\nStuff in many countries around the world. I do not want to know how many\ncountries, because I will only get cross again if someone remembers to tell\nme. I had broken two of my own cardinal rules and paid the price. I had not\nlooked to see if the leopard could change its spots, and I had not instructed\nmy managers at Dennis Publishing to quietly sound out the chances of sell-\ning Stuff.\nSo just before you dump your dream into the gutter, ensure you do the\nrounds of other companies in your neck of the woods. It only takes two of\nthem to become interested and you have the chance of getting an auction\n\f\ngoing. That has to be better than throwing your toys out of the cot in a\npaddy, as I did with Stuff. But only a bit better. Failure is always a bitch.\nFACING THE MUSIC\nBehold, I have played the fool,\nand erred exceedingly.\nTHE BIBLE, I SAMUEL 26:21\nSo here you are up to your neck in trouble. You have figured out your busi-\nness isn't viable. You've tried to look at the beast another way. No joy there.\nYou've made some humiliating telephone calls and paid some visits and tried\nto sell it or even give it away.\nNo interest. What now?\nOf course, you can try cutting costs to the bone. But that is of little use\nif there are insufficient costs to cut. And firing people is never much fun.\nDownsizing\nThe firm's alive with murmurs,\nThe thrum of gossips din,\nThe shrugs of old long-termers -\nWhoever's out - they're in.\nNo parachutes or rip-cords,\nNo lifebuoys as she dives,\nFat bastards with their clipboards\nAre sharpening their knives.\nReceptionists are tearful,\nThe Boss averts his eye,\n'H.R.' is grimly cheerful -\nBut then - they're paid to lie.\nIt's meeting, every minute,\nIt's tackle, grapple, block!\nIt's 'keep yer head down', innit?"

You'll\nhave to close the business. Be careful not to continue ordering goods or serv-\nices you know you will not be able to pay for. That's not just ethically wrong,\nit's legally wrong and you can get into serious trouble if you do it.\nIf necessary, you might have to declare bankruptcy. Well, you won't be\nthe first dreamer to do it, nor the first who came back from the experience\nfor a second bite at the cherry. Besides, bankruptcy laws and rules have\nchanged beyond recognition in recent years and have made the process far\nless onerous than it used to be. The authorities appear to bend over back-\nwards to help people declare bankruptcy today.\nI've never had to declare bankruptcy, thank goodness, but I sailed fairly\nclose to the wind a few times in the early days.

The earlier you take them into your confidence, the more\nleniently you will be treated. Sure they can seem like ogres, but I've never\nfound them to be so. They're human beings, just like you. Treat them like\nhuman beings, show them you are doing your best, and you may be very\npleasantly surprised.\nBut don't try to cheat them, my friend.

And he should be paid, even if you have to sell that nice\noffice furniture you foolishly ordered.\nThe more honest you are about your misfortune with those affected by it,\nthe easier the comeback will be. There is going to be a comeback, isn't there?\nBut the more you weasel and fib or tell outright lies or blame somebody else,\nthe less likely it is that anyone will want to do business with you again.\nSome people seem to think that out of sight is out of mind. That if they\ncheat you and a few months or years go by, you will forgive them, or, better\nstill, forget about them. But we don't forget and forgive people who weasel.\nI can remember the name of a man who stitched me up for only a thou-\nsand pounds twenty-five years ago. I've spent more than that on a fancy busi-\nness lunch since, and yet if his name comes up I will still cheerfully traduce\nhim to anyone who will listen. If he'd said sorry and been honest with me, I\ndoubt I would remember the incident had occurred.\nScrewing up isn't criminal or deliberate or malevolent. But covering up is,\nif you get caught. And you will get caught- ask the shade of Richard Nixon.\nClosing down a business or going into bankruptcy is a miserable business\nat any time. My advice is not to make it worse by omitting to apologise and\nshoulder the responsibility squarely. But don't take it too much to heart.\nThere's always the chance of a comeback.\nThat sounds easy for me to say. But I came very, very close to having to\ndeclare bankruptcy back in the Kung-fu Monthly days due to over-trading,\nand I went through many of the procedures I've just discussed. It's a rotten\njob, so get it done as fairly and as responsibly as you can. Experience is  \nonly\na name we give to our failures.\nYou are now a more experienced person. And next time round you'll\nensure that you do not duplicate your earlier mistakes. As old lags tell new\ninmates in the nick: 'You'vc done the crime, now do the time. No whinge-\ning.\" It's good advice.\nKEEPING IT STRAIGHT\nOnce in the racket, you're always in it.\nAL CAPONE, PHILADELPHIA PUBLIC LEDGER\nLastly in this section on business catastrophes, I'd like to talk a little about\n\f\ncompany money, personal money, and keeping on the straight and narrow.\nAbout dealing with temptation and avoiding a particular type of catastro-\nphe for which there is not the remedy of a bankruptcy petition or a sincere\napology.\nWhen you start a business, you are taking a risk. Sometimes a huge\nrisk, relatively speaking. This can have the effect, if you're lucky enough to\nhave any success, of muddling in your mind just what money belongs to\nwhich party.\nIt seems simple. It's your company, and therefore your money. But it isn't,\nyou know. That's not how the law sees it and not how your creditors see it  \nand\nnot how the tax authorities see it. It took me a while to get all this straight-\nened out in my own mind and to learn from one or two unhappy experiences.\nIf you're game, I hope to be able to save you from the errors I made and\nthat I've seen others make on the subject of what money belongs in which\npot. It goes something like this.\nA limited liability company is a legal entity. In theory, it is immortal. It\nhas rights and duties just as you do. It cannot be used as a personal milk cow\nfor you to plunder at will. You can certainly milk it, but only within reason,\nonly when there is enough milk to do so, and only in certain ways. If you\ndeviate from permitted methods, you can get yourself in a whole heap of\ntrouble very quickly.\nI have a friend, who must remain nameless. You'll see why in a minute.\nHe is a lovely bloke with a fantastic wife and two great kids. He started with\na little more capital than I did (that wouldn't have been hard) at about the\nsame time I set out. His business is international in scope and must be worth\ntens of millions of pounds by now. The compilers of the Sunday Times Rich\nList certainly think so, and have placed him in the lower readies of their list\nfor years.\nBut he has a blind spot. He believes he is his company. He thinks he and\nhis company are the same thing. Nothing will persuade him he is not. That's\na huge, potentially catastrophic, misunderstanding.\nHe has a home in Spain, and what a home! He has equipped it with\nphones, fax and computers and stays there a couple of months every year,\nwith his family. The company owns the house. He used his company's  \nmoney\nto buy it. He claims he works from that house - and maybe he does, a little.\nBut there aren't many people like me. I can sit (I am sitting) in one of\n\f\nthe loveliest houses on earth and work. I work eight to ten hours every day\nlocked away in a purpose-built work area. And I can prove I work. I make\nsure I can prove it, I am not pretending my house is a place where I work for\nseveral months every year. It is a place where I work and all the records of\ntelephone calls, computer usage, fax communications and the resulting\npaperwork proves it. More importantly, I bought my house with my own\nmoney, not the company's money.\nThat's not my friend's way. Not with a beautiful wife and children at an\nage when you want to spend time snorkelling and playing soccer with them\non a Spanish beach. He doesn't really work in his Spanish house. He\npretends to. For years, I have warned him he is running a huge risk. His\ncompany is paying for a 'benefit in kind' and that's just not on. He is break-\ning the rules and breaking the Saw by having the company pay for everything\nand not declaring a 'benefit in kind'.\nAnd what's so bad about that? Rather a lot, I'm afraid.\nIf (and I pray it is not when) the Inland Revenue catch him, he will be\nfor the high jump. If you use your company's money to buy yourself a fancy\ncar or a house or a boat or anything at all of that nature without declaring\nit, you are a criminal. Full stop. And sometimes, the Inland Revenue and\nthe VAT collectors put such criminals in jail. As well as fining them huge\nsums of money. So why does my friend do it? Because he founded the\ncompany. In his mind, he took all the risk and he thinks that whatever\nmoney the company has no use for belongs to him. But it doesn't. Not\nunless it is paid as salary, or a bonus or as a dividend. This is the thing to\nkeep in the forefront of your mind.\nIt's the company's money. Believe it or not, despite the fact that my friend\nis the sole shareholder in the company, he is not only stealing from the\nInland Revenue by his actions, he is stealing from his own company. It \nsounds\nbizarre. But it's true.\nNow I hate taxes as much as the next man. We are ridiculously over-taxed\nin Britain and the clever-dick 'stealth' taxes that our current government\nloves to worm into the fine print of every budget are a moral disgrace, as well\nas counter-productive in raising total revenues. So are our inheritance taxes,\nour so-called death duties. So are capital gains taxes, in my opinion. But my\nopinion doesn't count. I do not have judges and police officers and Inland\nRevenue investigators and jails at my disposal. The government does. It's\ncrazy to take on an opponent with so much firepower and try to cheat it of\nwhat the law says is its due.\n\f\nThere are a thousand other ways sole owners can cheat the Revenue and\nbilk their company. There's no need for me to list them here - I'm sure you\ncan imagine them easily enough. But listen to me. Don't go there. Just don't\ngo there.\nPay your taxes, remembering that no less a person than a lord chief\n\f\njustice of England once said that an English citizen has not only the right but\na duty to pay only the minimum tax applicable to him. You see, even high\ncourt judges aren't too keen on the Inland Revenue! Pay the least tax that is\nlawful. But pay it.\nBecause I own numerous companies, I have even set up a private office\nto ensure that one company isn't paying for me to make calls on behalf of\nanother. It's a good system and has worked well over the years.\nIt needed to be. When you are one of the richest people in the country,\nthe Inland Revenue allots you a special 'watcher'. This experienced civil\nservant keeps his or her beady eyes on you and your private and corporate tax\naffairs. I know he's watching me - and he knows that I know he's watching.\nRecently, I was investigated by the tax authorities. It was a long investi-\ngation and cost the Revenue a good deal of money, I should think. I had\nnever been investigated before. The arguments were complex and related to\nwhat tax was owed at what time, as opposed to whether tax was owed or not,\nor how much it all came to.\nI was able to settle for a fair sum. (You always seem to have to settle in a\ntax investigation, or so I'm told. The taxman rarely lets you off scot-free.)\nMy advisors and accountants demonstrated that I had never knowingly\nrobbed the Revenue of a penny.\nIt cost me a lot of money to prove it; some of which will be defrayed\nagainst my next tax bill. But I wasn't concerned during the investigation,\nbecause I knew I hadn't diddled anybody. That's another reason to keep on\nthe straight and narrow. You don't waste a lot of time covering up and\nwondering if you will be found out.\nThe directors of my companies, too, know that I do not 'raid' those\ncompanies improperly for cash, or force them to buy me my Rolls-Royce\nPhantoms, Maybachs and Bentleys. Nor do I get the companies to send me\nabroad for vacations or ask them to purchase houses for me to live in.\nThis is not because I am a better man, or ethically and morally superior\nto my friend. It's because I have been in prison once, for a short while, and\nI have no intention of going back there again. (I wasn't sent to prison for\nanything to do with money - it was over a hippy magazine the government\ntook exception to decades ago.)\nMy friend, however, has never been to prison. Let's hope he never does.\nBut I don't fancy his chances much while he keeps up his idiotic belief that\n\f\nhe is his company and he can do what he likes with his company's money and\ncheat the taxman while he's at it.\nOn a separate and happier subject, if you wind up investing and doing\nbusiness in the USA, do make certain you become a part of 'the non-double -\ntaxation treaty'. This ensures you are not taxed on profits you made in the\nStates and then taxed on them all over again when you bring the money back\nto Britain. Or vice versa.\nAs for becoming a tax exile (leaving a country to avoid paying tax by exploit-\ning loopholes in the law), I tried it once, twenty-odd years ago. It may work for\nsome people, but I found it tiresome, oddly disturbing and counter-productive.\n(Mind you, the capital gains tax in those days was astronomical- something like\n80 or 90 percent, so it was understandable why so many of us were on the same\nConcorde flight on 3 April 1983! You see? The date is engraved on my soul.\nExile of any sort is never pleasant and rarely worth the bother.)\nHow to sum all this up? I'm not an accountant, but it goes like this, I\nthink. If your company can afford to pay you money, then that's fine, as long\nas you declare that it has been paid and get ready to pay the tax on that\npayment. If you find other ways of moving the company's money into your\nown pocket without reporting the movement or using a company asset for\nyour personal life, you're almost certainly milking the cow in a way that is\nnot permitted.\nIt's that simple. And my advice is to keep it simple, and to hire compe-\ntent tax advisors just as soon as you begin earning money over and above\nyour salary.\nAfter all, what's the point of getting rich and then sitting for a year or\nmore behind bars in a nasty, dangerous environment while the authorities\nfigure out just how much they are going to fine you and how long you are\ngoing to rot there? Prisons may have improved since the days of Newgate,\nbut I can assure you they are not pleasant places to be.\nThere are a thousand professionals who will show you how to pay the\nminimum of tax possible in return for a fee. I reckon that an investment in\nthose services, extortionate as they may seem, is a far better investment than\nfiddling what you should have paid the taxman in the first place.\nGetting rich isn't so difficult. But if you want to stay rich, then pay your\ntaxes and don't milk the cow without reporting it. End of lecture."

    "raw_text": "1 7\nA RECAP\nFOR IDLERS\nHere we all are in no-man's land,\nThe lame and the halt, the sick and the damned;\nTunnelling dirt and shovelling sand,\nHere we all are in no-man's land...\n'No-MAN's LAND'\nMost of us love short cuts, though they often lead us astray. Or magic bullets\nwhich we are told will solve an intractable problem, though we know they\ndon't really exist. Not in the real world.\nThis desire to 'cut to the chase' is perfectly understandable. Our lives are\nshort, and none of us is getting any younger. But if you've just picked up this\nbook and have turned straight to this chapter, then I'm afraid you're proba-\nbly in for a disappointment. 'A Recap for Idlers' is not a short cut or a magic\nbullet to save you reading the rest of the book. Instead, I am going to\nattempt to recap the 'important bits', or rather, the bits that I now believe\nwere important when I was getting rich myself.\nSo please be warned: parts of what follow won't make much sense if you\nare unfamiliar with what came before.\nTHE QUEST  FOR WEALTH: A HEALTH WARNING\nThere is no fortress so strong that money cannot take it.\nCICERO, IN VERREM\nCicero was a subtle man. Money can reduce any fortress; but which fortress\nis he speaking of, do you think? The enemy's (whoever the 'enemy' may be)\nor your own? Let us assume it is the latter.\nSo what is your fortress? It is your inner core, your integrity, your belief\nin the worth of others and the love of those dear to you. Not to mention\nyour own worth. It arises from belief in yourself. And, for a few, from a  \nbelief\nin their own destiny.\n\f\nExcessive idolatry of money will 'take' all those. It will corrode both self-\nbelief and love. It will stretch integrity on the rack. It will 'take' the fortress;\nand it will not be a pretty sight.\nSeeking substantial wealth is almost always a fool's game. The statistics\nshow that very few people ever succeed. Most of them should never have\nmade the attempt in the first place. They aren't suited to it. And if that\nsounds defeatist, then consider the fact that the search will take up a great\ndeal of your waking life for many, many years.\nYou cannot get rich without 'wasting' that time. Not unless you were\nborn lucky - so lucky that luck would have squatted on your shoulder virtu-\nally from birth. You would not need to get rich, then. You would already be\nrich, in one way or another.\nTime is finite. Which is a fancy way of saying that you only have so much\nof it - then it will run out. When you are young, time seems to stretch into\nthe distance for so far that surely it will always be on your side? When the\nyoung catch the old unawares, they may sometimes glimpse a look of naked\nenvy, which is then instantly disguised.\nAnd the old have reason to be envious. Truly, truly, they do.\nAsk me what I will give you if you could wave a magic wand and give me\nmy youth back. The answer would be everything I own and everything I will\never own. In The Odyssey we read:\nAnd Achilles replied, 'Do not speak soothingly to me of death, glorious\nOdysseus. I would rather live on earth as a bondsman to the meanest\npeasant, than be king of all the shadows.'\nHomer, as always, is right.\nIf you are young and reading this then I ask you to remember just this:\nyou are richer than anyone older than you, and far richer than those who are\nmuch older. What you choose to do with the time that stretches out before\nyou is entirely a matter for you. But do not say you started the journey poor.\nIf you are young, you are infinitely richer than I can ever be again.\nMoney is never owned. It is only in your custody for a while. Time is\nalways running on, and the young have more of it in their pocket than the\nrichest man or woman alive. That is not sentimentality speaking. That is\nsober fact.\n\f\nAnd yet you wish to waste your youth in the getting of money? Really?\nThink hard, my young cub, think hard and think long before you embark on\nsuch a quest. The time spent attempting to acquire wealth will mount up.\nAnd it cannot be reclaimed, whether you succeed or whether you fail.\nAnd even should you succeed in becoming rich, unlikely as that is, what\nwill you have achieved: Independence of a kind? The luxury to choose what\nyou wish to do with the rest of your life? Happiness? No, no and no. You will\nnot achieve any of those things. Not when you have too much money.\nAs Francis Bacon, one of the greatest minds ever to grace England's\ncorridors of power, warned in his Essays:\nI cannot call Riches better than the baggage (hindrance) of virtue. The\nRoman word is better, impedimenta. For as the baggage is to an army,\nso riches to virtue. It cannot be spared or left behind, but it hindereth the\nmarch; yea, and the care of it sometime loseth or disturbeth the victory.\nIt does indeed. Wealth makes many demands and, by the time you have\nacquired it, you will be prey to certain habits. You will fear to lose it and must\nspend a great deal more time to defend it. No one is 'independent' of the\nhuman race. 'No man is an island entire of itself, every man is a piece of the\ncontinent, a part of the main.'' Heed the words of John Donne, finest of\npoets: 'And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls: it tolls for\nthee.' Aye, so it does.\nNo luxury of choices for rich little you. You will be too busy keeping the\nsea from washing away the sand you have spent so long collecting at such\nterrible cost to your health and your sanity and your relationships with\nothers. It is always thus. There is no escape. You believe (I know you do) that\nit will be different for you. But it won't be. It never is.\nHappiness? Do not make me laugh. The rich are not happy. I have yet to\nmeet a single really rich happy man or woman - and I have met many rich\npeople. The demands from others to share their wealth become so tiresome,\nand so insistent, they nearly always decide they must insulate themselves.\nInsulation breeds paranoia and arrogance. And loneliness. And rage that you\nhave only so many years left to enjoy rolling in the sand you have piled up.\nThe only people the self-made rich can trust are those who knew them\nbefore they became wealthy. For many newly rich people, the world becomes\na smaller, less generous and darker place. It sounds ridiculous, doesn't it?\nRidiculous and gloomy.\nBut then, you are to consider that I have been very poor and I am now-\n\f\nvery rich. I am an optimist by nature. And I have the ability to write poetry\nand create the forest I am busy planting. Am I happy? No. Or, at least, only\noccasionally, when I am walking in the woods alone, or deeply ensconced in\ncomposing a difficult piece of verse, or sitting quietly with old friends over a\nbottle of wine. Or feeding a stray cat.\nI could do all those things without wealth. So why do I not give it all away?\nBecause I worked too hard for it. Because I am tainted by it. Because I\nam afraid to. All those reasons and more. Perhaps, if l am lucky enough to\nbecome old, I will accumulate something else: the courage to give it all away\nbefore I die. That would be a good thing, I think.\n(When I die, it is all going to a charity called 'The Forest of Dennis'. You\nsee, even when I do a good thing with my money, my ego insists that I name\nit for myself. Not a good sign.)\nGiving money away when you are dead takes no guts. No courage. But\nto divest yourself of hundreds of millions of dollars, or the greater part of\nyour fortune, before your death? That would be something to be proud of,\ndon't you think? It even makes logical sense.\nFor what is left afterwards but a few tears by a graveside and years of bick-\nering and waste over a complex will? (The wills of the rich are always\ncomplex.) Bitter years, where lawyers count the number of fairies they  \nbelieve\nyou once thought danced upon the head of a pin - years in which they enrich\nthemselves at your descendants' expense. A fine legacy, to be sure.\nBut you must make your own choice. I have said my piece and I meant\nevery word of it. This small part of my book was composed in my mind years\nago. It was easy to write. I knew all of it before my fingers touched the\nkeyboard. It has troubled me for years and I thank you for allowing me to\nshare it.\nI suspect it will have little effect on you, though. You are probably young\nand are tired of being poor. And tired, from years of growing up and school-\ning, and of being lectured. Very well. Let us return to a recap of the 'impor-\ntant bits' to help you on your journey. But just before we do, can I ask you\nto do me a small favour?\nPlease lodge one fact in your memory: that the last one thousand five\nhundred words WAS an 'important bit'. In my heart of hearts, I know it was\nthe most important bit you will read in this book.\nMark it with a bookmark and write today's day upon it. Come back to it"

    "raw_text": "in twenty or thirty years, when new books printed on paper will be rare\nobjects. Then cast your mind back to a time when you were young, and you\nfirst read this book, and to the thoughts of a fool, a rich poet, long dead,\nwho once typed these words sitting in one of the most beautiful houses on\nearth, staring at a turquoise sea, sipping a glass of slightly chilled Chateau\nd'Yquem.\nThat will be enough for me.\nEnough! Let's get on with getting rich!\nCUT LOOSE\nWhen all the world is young, lad,\nAnd all the trees are green;\nAnd every goose a swan, lad,\nAnd every lass a queen;\nThen hey for boot and horse, lad,\nAnd round the world away;\nYoung blood must have its course, lad,\nAnd every dog his day.\nCHARLES KlNGSLEY, FROM THE WATER BABIES\nYou have to cut loose to get rich. There isn't any other way.\nFirstly, of course, you must break loose from your parents and family\nhome. It's possible to get rich from your bedroom while your mother is iron-\ning your shirt or blouse downstairs, I suppose. But it's unlikely.\nI read in my magazine The Week (shameless plug) that hundreds of thou-\nsands of young men in Japan are isolating themselves in their bedrooms for\nmonths or even years at a time in a growing phenomenon known as hikiko-\nmori, or 'withdrawal'.\nHow ineffably sad. Modern society is breeding a race of New Age young\nhermits. The article goes on to report that many parents can support such\nchildren indefinitely, and they choose to do so. 'Japanese parents tell their\nchildren to fly,' one expert told The New York Times, 'while holding firmly\nto their ankles.'\n\f\nLet's assume you have no wish to spend the next few years locked in your\nbedroom. What then? Perhaps you are already working. Perhaps you are\nliving with someone, or are married, or have children. No matter. As long as\nyou have cut the parental knot, you are in good shape.\nNow you must cut yourself loose from naysayers and negative influences:\nthe Jeremiahs. These wretches cover the face of the earth. They will tell  \nyou,\nif you listen, about the impossibility (not the foolishness) of trying to make\nyourself wealthy. In doing so, they drain confidence and optimism from you.\nSuch people often include your parents, your lover, your husband or your\nwife, and your 'friends'. Which is not surprising. It's not that they do not\ncare about you. They may well do so, in their own way. But two cardinal  \nfears\nrule their concern.\nFirstly, they fear that you are placing yourself in harm's way — and, to\nthem, that cannot be a good thing. Secondly, they fear that if you should\nsucceed, you will expose their own timidity to the light of day.\nThe order in the 'pack' from which you spring, the family grouping, will\nbe shattered. Should you become rich you will become the number-one dog\nin the pack, and their own order will slip accordingly. Above all, they do not\nwish to be faced with the mess and chaos that accompanies strenuous effort.\nThey want the familiarity and sense of false security that comes with things\nstaying as they are.\nDo not despise these people. Seek to calm them. Or hide from them\nwhat you are about for as long as you can. If that will not work, ignore them\nand move on. That is a hard thing to say and a harder thing to do, but it is\nnecessary. You cannot spend your life assuaging the fear of failure (and\nsuccess) that is the common lot of the risk averse.\nShould you have parents who are too ambitious for your future, then much\nthe same advice applies. The stereotype for this in the twentieth century was\nthe American Jewish mother, determined that her sons should become  \ndoctors\nor lawyers. This is all very well, but it will not make you rich, because, in its\nway, it is yet another attempt to slot you into a preordained path. You must  \ncut\nloose from it to become wealthy. Or to be happy, for that matter.\nFear of failure is a subject about which I have already written in this\nbook, probably to excess. I repeat that it is the main stumbling block to\n\f\ngetting rich for most people. You simply have to face up to it, stare it in the\neye and cut loose from such thoughts. Here is Robert Johnson, perhaps the\ngreatest blues guitarist who ever lived, singing about fear of failure:\nI got stones in my passway and my road seems dark at night.\nI got stones in my passway and my road seems dark at night,\nI have pains in my heart, they have taken my appetite.\nNo doubt. Johnson died of poison, administered by the lover or husband of\na girl he was making eyes at in a juke joint. The story goes that he was\nwarned that his drink had been poisoned. He smiled and drank it anyway. It\ntook him a day or so to die, in agony one assumes.\nI have often wondered why he did it. Perhaps it was because he already\nknew how great a musician he was. (When I say Johnson was the greatest\nblues guitarist who ever lived, I mean precisely that. He is worshipped by\nmusicians such as Eric Clapton and Ry Cooder.) Such knowledge breeds the\nkind of recklessness you see when people walk right to the edge of a cliff and\nperform a handstand, just for the hell of it.\nI used to do such things myself. I would run across a narrow waterpipe\nthat spanned a canal and weir. If I had fallen, I would probably have\ndrowned. The canal was near a pub where I used to play with an R&B band.\nSome nights, I would earn more money from bystanders by running back-\nwards and forwards across that pipe than from my performance fee. It was\nstupid and dangerous. But somehow, I knew I wouldn't fall.\nI'm not suggesting you begin doing handstands on clifftops or risking\nlife and limb. But I am suggesting that you must cut loose, in your mind,\nfrom your previous life. Getting rich comes from an attitude of mind. It isn't\ngoing to happen if things drift on pretty much the way they are right now.\nCutting loose can be painful. I have heard of very few men or women\nwho made a ton of money who did not leave, or divorce, their wives or\nhusbands or lovers sooner or later. Or who were not estranged from family\nmembers, often their children. It comes with the territory. Even if you hand\nover large sums as a gift to those you had to cut loose from to get it, they\nwill never really forgive you.\nIt isn't the money, you see. It is because you have humiliated them, in\ntheir minds anyway, both by succeeding and by valuing the time it took for\nyou to succeed over their part in your life. And that, in a nutshell, is why it\nis so important to cut loose, especially in the early days."

    "raw_text": "Focus, determination and relentless drive are wearing in themselves -\nboth to you and those around you. Any distraction whatever can cost you a\nchance that may not come again. And, for the purposes of this book, family,\nlovers and friends are distractions, plain and simple.\nThere are exceptions, of course, and perhaps you will be one of them.\nBut don't count on it. Chances are that you will have to cut loose from your\nold life in more ways than you imagine and that the breach will never really\nbe healed.\nLasdy, it goes without saying that you must cut loose from working for\nother people. If you have been gainfully employed since you left school or\ncollege, this is an oddly difficult thing to do.\nIt is dunned into our head that we should work. Western civilisation is\nbased upon a work ethic that has propelled it into the front rank of\nthe tribes and cultures we share this planet with. If you have ever stood,\nearly in the morning, on a weekday in New York City and watched the\ncountless tens of thousands of workers hurrying to their steel and glass\ntowers, you can catch a scent of this ethic. It is frightening, but exhilarating,\ntoo. The air itself reeks of drive, and determination and focus. It is like a\ndrug. And it has served America and her people well - at least in the sense\nof material wealth.\nNow you must leave the safety of the ant colony and the hive. You are to\nbecome a loner, an outcast, cut off from the very thing that defines what\nmany of us believe we are. What is the first question usually asked by\nstrangers of each other? Right, it's 'What do you do?' In some cultures, the\nway of answering may be different; but it nearly always relates to work in the\nWest: 'I'm a teacher; I'm in banking; I'm a dairy farmer; I'm an HR admin-\nistrator; I'm a sound engineer.' Our job defines us.\nBut it cannot define you. Not any more. You are a wild pig rooting for\ntruffles. You are a weasel about to rip the throat out of a rabbit. You are an\nentrepreneur. You are going to be rich, and you don't much care, within the\nlaw, how you are going to do it.\nI recently attended a funeral. These days, I attend too many of them. The\nelderly mother of one of my girlfriends at school was there. Truth to tell, I\nhad forgotten of her existence. I only dated her daughter once or twice.\nThe old lady looked me up and down in a disquieting way and I had a\nvision of a much younger woman cutting me a slice of cake and pouring me\na cup of tea."

    "raw_text": "'So you did it,' she said, her thin lips half smiling, but compressed in a\ndisapproving line.\n'Uh-huh,' I replied, not knowing what the hell she was talking about.\n'I hope it was worth it?'\n'What was worth what, ma'am?7\n'You used to frighten me, did you know that? Oh, I was frightened you\nwould marry Sally. But I was frightened of you. I was a mother and thirty\nyears older than you. But you scared the hell out of me. I told Sally to stay\naway from you.'\n'Yes, I remember. Why?'\n'Because when you first began coming around after Sally, I asked you\nwhat you were going to do when you left school. You looked me in the\neye. Your eyes weren't like any teenager I ever knew. They were fierce, like\na tiger's. You were insolent and arrogant and frightening. I told my\nhusband so.'\n'I'm sorry for that.'\n'You told me you were going to get rich. Not that you were going to\nuniversity or were after this or that job. Just that you were going to be rich.\nI never forgot it.'\nI made some inane reply and tried to jolly her along. But she wasn't\nhaving any. The one advantage about being old is that you can say whatever\nthe damn hell you please and younger people have to listen to it.\nShe'd said her piece. She had no more to say. I left the funeral with a\ndouble burden. Not just the death of an old friend, but the knowledge that\nI had frightened a woman who had tried to be kind to me when I was a boy.\nNot exactly an epitaph to be proud of, is it?\nBut she was right. I was like that. And so will you be. You will do\nanything it takes, short of larceny, fraud, blackmail and murder. You will cut\nyourself loose, but the tiger chained to your ankle will come right along with\nyou. He will always be with you, until the day you turn him loose by an\neffort of will.\nBy cutting loose, you will be free to make a whopping great fortune\nwhile your tiger scares the hell out of little old ladies. And old gentlemen for\nthat matter. And if you do not have a tiger handy, I suggest you acquire one\n\f\nquickly if you wish to amass serious wealth.\nNo matter. We are not here to discuss the rag-and-bone shop of your\nheart or make metaphors about tigers.\nCut loose, my friend. Cut loose and get rich.\nCHOOSE THE RIGHT MOUNTAIN\nThere stands a lady on a mountain,\nWho she is I do not know,\nAll she wants is gold and silver;\nI shall to the mountain go!\nANON. 'Kiss in THE RING'\nThe world is full of money. Some of that money has your name on it. All you\nhave to do is collect it.\nIf you are not just reading this hook for a bit of entertainment (nothing\nwrong with that), and if you seriously do wish to  get rich, them I am going\nto ask you to memorise the words below, close the book and repeat the\nwords again to yourself. Let's go:\nTHE WORLD IS FULL OF MONEY. SOME OF IT HAS MY\nNAME ON IT. ALL I HAVE TO DO IS COLLECT IT.\nDone that? OK, now we're rockin' and rollin'. The first question to answer\nis where is the goddamn money? Let's imagine it is in a mine in a mountain.\nFine. Which mountain? The mountain that is already making a lot of other\npeople rich would be a good bet.\nGold rushes don't happen in old mines. There will be people making a\ngood living out of old mines, but they won't be too keen to let you muscle\nin on their stake, Look for new mountains where gold is being mined; or will\nbe mined soon.\nLet us speak plainly. This is not the time to begin a chain of car dealer-\nships. Car dealerships are great, but it's an old mine. Don't go there unless\nyou have a brand new angle. Making and distributing beer is an old mine.\nUnless you have a new angle (like 'real ale'), then that's a mountain to\navoid. Of course, if you're really imaginative, you can often come up with\nsuch an angle.\nIn St Vincent and the Grenadines, a small country of which I am a proud\n\f\ncitizen, there is a beer company. They make a good beer called Hairoun. I\nexpect the company makes decent money even though the entire country\nonly has 120,000 citizens. Could I muscle in on this market?\nYes.\nHow?\nI would invent a new beer. I would print a number inside each bottle cap.\nI would set up a lottery, with the agreement of the government. There\nwould be a draw once a month. Whoever produced the beer cap with the\nwinning number would win a substantial cash prize. Fifty per cent of the\nlottery money would go to the winner. Ten per cent would go to the govern-\nment. Forty per cent would go to good causes — children in need, orphans,\neducation, that kind of thing.\nI would then launch my beer with the kind of advertising blitz that St\nVincent and the Grenadines has never (mercifully) seen. I would make tele-\nvision commercials where a bartender asks a good-looking Vincentian man\nif he wants another beer. 'Sure,' he'll reply. \"I'll have one for the widows and\norphans.' Big grin. Frothy beer slapped on the counter. Logos for the beer\nexplode on screen surrounded by falling money.\nMy beer would wipe the floor with Hairoun. (Hey! this is a hypothetical\nexample we're exploring here.) Everybody wants to get rich. Once a month\npeople smiling and holding a big cheque would appear on television adver-\ntising my beer. I would begin exporting the beer to other islands and doing\nthe same trick there. What would I call my beer? Let's see: the slang for a\nVincentian citizen is 'Vincy'. That's it! I'll call it Vincy Beer. The slogan will\nbe: 'One for the Widows and Orphans'. Or: 'The Beer for Winners'.\n(OK, OK, I'm not as good at making up marketing slogans as I am at\nbrewing beer.) So why have I told you this, and thereby warned the brewers\nand distributors of Hairoun of my evil intentions concerning my (truly) great\nidea? Easy. Because I have about a hundred good ideas every day. Ideas are\nten a penny. And because I have no intention of going into the beer busi-\nness. (Or is that a double bluff?)\nYou see, you have to choose a new mine where you suspect there is\nmoney, or an old mine with a different angle to get rich. The right moun-\ntain. A great new mine right now is in telecommunications, or the internet,\nor legalised gambling. Property is always good. (You can start small in prop-\nerty and you can get lucky quickly. It's a crowded market, though, for that\nvery reason.)\n\f\nIt's vital you choose a mountain which produces money that has your\nname on it. Your instinct should come into play here. Everything depends,\njust for once, on what you feel drawn towards and what repels you. I have\nalways hated watching television. Paradoxically, I have always fancied being\na producer or director of mindless garbage. I think I missed a trick by not\ngoing into television earlier - although one of my companies in Beverly Hills\nis busy at it right now.\nOne thing is for sure, you must avoid the trap of going into what you\nthink will make you money if you have no empathy or feeling for what you\nare about to do. There's no future in that.\nI know an editor and writer. He's a great editor and writer. But he feels\nhe has to be a publisher and do all the stuff that publishers do - like wear\nsuits, write cheques and hire and fire people. He's crazy. He will never be\nrich because he will not use his vast writing and editing talent to the full.\nHe's always too busy being a lousy businessman.\nAvoid that trap. Don't do anything because you feel you have to. Go for\nwhat attracts you. Go for something that exploits your natural talents.\nGo to the mountain which produces money. Money that has your name\non it.\nFEAR NOTHING\nNo passion so effectually robs the mind of all its powers\nof acting and reasoning as fear.\nEDMUND BURKE, THE SUBLIME A ND BEAUTIFUL\nFear nothing. Another easy-to-say and impossible piece of advice. Tough\nluck, chum. Life's a bitch and then you die. Get used to it. It isn't going to\nchange any time soon.\nWhat is there to fear? Everything and nothing. Try looking at it through\nmy eyes. I am an insignificant little worm on an insignificant planet which\ncircles an insignificant star in a big (presumably) bad universe. A universe I\nwill never comprehend, nor can ever hope to comprehend.\nJust like everything that walks, breathes, grows, flies, crawls or swims, I\nam going to die. One day, my planet will die. Long, long after, the sun it\nstill circles as a dead rock will die. Then there will be darkness on the face\nof the earth. That is, there would be darkness if there was any creature alive\nto view it.\n\f\nArmies and governments fear men or women who know they are going\nto die soon; and they have good reason to. Such people have nothing to\nlose. They will commit any atrocity and take as many others with them as\nthey can, if they are driven to it. You must now become that doomed man\nor woman. Yon are going to die. Nothing can alter the fact. It is immutable.\nIncomprehensible. Unfair. All those things.\nBut it sets you free, don't you see? It sets you free.\nWhat does anything matter if you are going to die? Nothing matters.\nNothing at all. Get that through your terrified mind and you will wake up in\nthe morning ready to rip the throat out of the first gazelle unfortunate\nenough to cross your path. Why would you rip its throat out? Because you\ncan. Not for breakfast. Not for the 'thrill of the chase'. But because you can.\nIf you want to be rich you must make a pact with yourself about fear of\nanything. You cannot banish fear, but you can face it down, stomp on it,\ncrush it, bury it, padlock it into the deepest recesses of your heart and soul\nand leave it there to rot.\nJust try. Try for just a single day, a whole day when you refuse to\nacknowledge fear of failure, fear of making yourself look like an idiot, fear of\nlosing your lover, fear of losing your job, fear of your boss, fear of anything\nand of any kind. Fear will creep back, usually at three in the morning. Laugh\nat it and tell it to take a hike. Smash it in the teeth. Spit on it. Put your arms\nround it and make nicey-nicey. Then slip a sharp blade into its stinking throat\njust as you're French-kissing it.\nGo on. I dare you. If you can do it, this will transform your life. Not for\nthe better. I didn't promise you that. But you will instantly perceive (among\nmany other tilings) just how much money there is in the world and how piti-\nfully easy it is to obtain it. Money that already has your name on it.\nAll that is stopping you is fear. I do not know of what kind. It may even\nbe fear of succeeding. But if you want to be rich, gentle reader, and if you\ncan read these words, then all that is stopping you is fear of one kind or\nanother. You have no one to blame but yourself. The world is full of gazelles\nwith diamonds in their guts.\nLook! There's one over there, right now! Let's go rip its throat out and\ntake the diamond. Maybe there will be two diamonds. If there isn't, then I'm\nkeeping the first diamond, you understand? Otherwise I'll rip your throat\nout, too. Come on! There's nothing to fear. Let's get rich!\nThat is what getting rich is going to be like. You will become a predator.\n\f\nA killer. You will cease to be prey. You will not succumb to fear. Others will\nfear you. Especially gazelles bearing diamonds.\nThis will make no difference to an insignificant worm on an insignificant\nplanet circling an insignificant star. No difference whatever. Nothing can\nhold back the coming dark. Nothing can alter the fact that you will cease one\nday to breathe and think. Nothing can amend the truth, that within a few\nmillion circlings of a rock around a dying sun, there will remain no trace of\nyou, your tribe, your race or your diamonds. Nothing can alter that.\nBut just for a moment (just for one moment, you understand?) just for a\nheartbeat in the life of the planet, one little worm, who thinks he is a tiger,\nwill be rich.\nMuch of what I have written in this book may be wrong. Misguided.\n'Tosh' as we used to say in my school playground. I accept that, I am far\nfrom infallible on the subject of getting rich. But this last short essay\nconcerning fear and its influence is, I think, wholly true. It is fear that rules\nus. Love and respect and other such emotions make it bearable, at a price.\nBut fear rules us all, and always has.\nWhich is odd. Because what can there be for us to fear, when each of us\nknows we shall die eventually? Is it a definition of sentiency?\nFear is no bad thing, perhaps. I have been feeding a feral cat here on\nMustique in my new cottage for the last few weeks while I wrote this book.\nShe is a tabby I call Stringy because her tail is so thin. She comes to my  \nporch\nwhen I call twice a day. Yesterday, she finally pecked, and then edged, into\nthe cottage itself and padded across the Persian rugs. Within minutes, she\nwas playing with the rug tassels like a kitten. Maybe she had no kittenhood,\nin the eat-or-be-eaten world of feral cats.\nYet she takes flight at the least sound or movement. If the refrigerator turns\nitself on, or if I rise from my chair or move suddenly, she scoots to the door.\nWhy? She is safe here and must be beginning to sense the fact. She is eating\nbetter than she has ever eaten in her life. She has grown used to the delicious\ntaste of cow's milk. Not to mention smoked salmon. So why does she flee?\nFear rules her life. That is why she flees. Fear keeps her safe from her\nenemies - though there are no predators on the island to trouble her, except\nman. Perhaps I should be careful not to cause her to lose her fear of humans\ncompletely, even if I could do such a thing. Perhaps she is better off running\nscared of her own shadow."

Was all\nthat rage and fierceness and drive and stamina rooted in my own fear? Have\nI used fear as a fuel in the getting of money?\nPerhaps I have, although I never thought of it that way before. In any case,\nI'm not certain I want to know, I have never trusted armchair psychiatry.\nBut I do know that you must make an accommodation with your fears if\nyou are to succeed. At least, I know that to be true in my own case. As to  \nhow\nsuch a trick is to be accomplished, I cannot help you.

What use\nto muddy the waters with logic and statistics - bugaboos that will only serve\nto discourage you from taking the plunge?\nThere is a place for impetuosity and leaps of faith. A place for belief. That\nplace is here. And the time is now.

I can tell you\na true story of a man who lost millions and millions of pounds that were his\nfor the taking because he went on vacation.\nThe magazine that generated my first huge pile twenty-five years ago fell\nto me when the managing director of a large rival suspended negotiations\nwith the founder of the magazine while he went abroad. He probably figured\nthe deal was nearly done and the seller could cool his heels for a week or two.\nIt wasn't important enough for him to change his travel plans.\nNaturally enough, this angered the young man attempting to sell his\nprized asset. It was disrespectful. By the time that managing director\nreturned from abroad, a majority interest in the magazine was mine, signed,\nsealed and delivered to Dennis Publishing.\nMy rival deserved to lose out. He prevaricated. He wasted his opportu-\nnity to purchase a magazine that has since generated way over $100,000,000"

    "raw_text": "in gross revenues. You can forgive yourself for not doing something if you\nhonestly got it wrong. But it is harder to forgive yourself when lack of impe-\ntus allows it to slip through your fingers.\nNeed will drive you, but you must not prevaricate. You must act at the\nslightest hint of a chance to make money. You must go, go, go!\nMy little feral cat, Stringy, crept into my cottage driven by desperate\nneed. She was hungry. She was reckless to enter. I might have slammed the\ndoor, grabbed her and roasted her! How would she know otherwise? Yet in\nshe came, driven by want and desire. Now she feasts on the finest meat, fish\nand milk money can buy - twice a day. She seized her opportunity.\nYou may have many reasons for caution and proceeding carefully. There\nalways are such reasons. They creep about a fearful mind like Tolkien's\nGollum, wearing spirit to a shadow and sapping optimism with dread. Cast\nthem out, these 'reasons'. They are nothing. They are sprites and fancies of\nyour imagination that will vanish if you so much as say boo! to their lick-\nspittle goose.\nIf you wish to get rich, there are no reasons why you should not get rich.\nNone at all.\nFor they are not 'reasons'; they are excuses. For the most part they are\npitiful alibis, half truths and self-serving evasions you have erected to spare\nyourself from the quiet terror of taking your own financial life in your hands\nand making your dreams concrete reality. They are the children of fear and\nthe parents of a thousand 'if onlys'.\nIt may well be true, should you succeed, that you will discover you are\nnot as happy as you once believed wealth might make you. But is that a\nreason for not beginning? Perhaps I will be proved wrong and you will\nbecome rich and as happy as a lark in spring. Who knows? You will never find\nout if you do not try, and if you do not begin trying now.\nBelieve me, I have heard all the reasons. They have been laid out for my\ninspection on scores of occasions by people in a similar position to yourself.\nEven by several of my godchildren. On close examination, they have all\nproven to be bogus.\nThe only three valid reasons for not attempting to become rich are: 'I do\nnot wish to be rich.' Or, 'I wish to be rich but I have other priorities.' Or, 'I\nam too stupid to try to get rich.'\nThese are valid reasons, especially the last. As for the second, what kind\n\f\nof a world would we live in if Vincent van Gogh had never painted, if\nBeethoven had had no time to compose symphonies, if Emily Dickinson had\nnever written a poem or if Narcis Monturiol had not perfected the world's\nfirst, fully fledged, double-hulled submarine? All of them died relatively poor\nor flat broke. Nor have I ever read that giants of thought and philosophy\nfared much better.\nAnd what of your family? Ah, yes; what kind of a childhood would you\nhave had if your mother and father had abandoned you to a wet, dark cot\nwhile they scrabbled day and night to become wealthy? So, yes, there are\nvalid reasons. But not many of us can lay claim to them. Most of us are ordi-\nnary Joes. We will never compose a symphony or invent the modern subma-\nrine. And a great many of us will not have children.\nWhich leads me to what, I suspect, will prove a controversial take on the\nsubject of having children and getting rich. Anyone who has not had a child\ncannot know the depths of anguish and joy that parents endure. I accept that\nas a childless man. But so often, children are used as a bogus trump card in\nany debate on the central theme of this book.\n'It's OK for you, but I have responsibilities. My family comes first.' Yes,\nyes, yes. I am sure you feel better having got that off your chest. But how\nmuch real truth is there in it?\nI have many godchildren. I have watched, closely in some cases, as\nnewborn babes become toddlers, as young tykes shoot through school and\ncollege and as body-pierced immortals launch themselves like demons of the\npit upon an unsuspecting world. And I have seen the relationship between\nchildren and their parents alter. Close-up and personal.\nIt is my belief that children do not care if parents are rich or poor,\nproviding there is enough money for basic essentials like food, clothing and\nshelter. What they care about is unconditional love. That is the only key the\n* .'\nonly true priority, although they neither know it, nor say so, after five or six\nyears old.\nIn my formative years, I was brought up in surroundings that our polit-\nically correct age would describe as 'modest'. For part of my early childhood\nwe lived in my grandparents' tiny terraced house, two steps up from a slum\n(although kept spotlessly clean) with no electricity, no kitchen that you\nwould recognise as one, and no indoor lavatory or bathroom. The tin bath\nhung in the coal shed to keep it from going rusty. There was no heating but\n\f\na coal fire in the parlour. No light but gas and candles.\nIn the affluent West, that's poor, my friend, any way you cut it. If times\nwere tight, the nasty, shiny Izal lavatory paper that came in a box would\nvanish from the outside lavatory to be replaced by neatly torn squares of\nnewspaper hanging on a butcher's hook. Personally, I preferred the newspa-\nper and always kept a secret stash in the garden shed.\nThen my mother's career began to flourish and our lives changed. We\nbecame 'middle class' overnight. I got a bike. There was a smart bathroom\nin our new garden flat with a modern bath and hot water pouring out of\nthe tap. The lavatory paper came in soft, comfy rolls. We were allowed pets\nand we had a lawn with a big tree to play cowboys and Indians in. Was I a\nmite happier?\nI don't believe so. I had a wonderful time in my grandparents' house. All\nthe other kids in the alley there were in the same boat. We didn't even know\nwe were poor. Material surroundings are of far more importance to adults\nthan children.\nLogically, then, the excuse 'I have got responsibilities' can only refer in\nmost cases to the unconditional love part. Young children neither know nor\ncare if their mummy and daddy are rich. It doesn't enter into the equation.\nBut the unconditional love part, and especially its expression, are central to\nany child's well-being.\nNow you can see, perhaps, why I have little time for what appears, at\nfirst, to be a Teflon-coated excuse. At least, in many cases. If you want to be\nrich and you have young children, then do not use them as your alibi for not\nmaking the attempt. Or, if you must use their existence as an alibi, then at\nleast have the courtesy, the decency, to acknowledge that such reasoning is\nnothing but an alibi.\nOf course, having young children and scrabbling to get rich is harder\nthan it is for those without children. I do not deny that. But it has been\ndone, and done thousands of times, to boot. It is not a fatal impediment,\nmerely another 'stone in your passway', as Robert Johnson would put it.\nI happen to know a man, a relative of sorts, who has many of the char-\nacter ingredients of an entrepreneur, and yet has remained poor all his life.\nHe is a pain in the neck. For years I had to listen to his blowhard spouting\nabout how many of his ideas would have changed the world, if only he had\nnot had children and 'responsibilities'.\nFinally, I went out and bought him a copy of a Louis Jordan CD and\n\f\nplayed it to him at full blast. Here's one of the verses:\nI been hearin' all about all your big ideas\nSince you started. What's the hitch?\nYou ain't never made ten dollars yet,\nYet you say you can balance the national debt,\nIf you're so smart,\nHow come you ain't rich?\nHe blustered as usual, so I gave him my 'alibi' speech, in front of his wife\nand children. Then I left the house, which was in uproar. I doubt I will ever\nbe invited back - which is fine by me.\nHis kids, who are fully grown, were in secret ecstasy when I played that\nrecord. Fancy having to listen endlessly to a fathcr who, between the lines, is\nblaming you for his and his wife's relative poverty. What a schmuck. What a\nsilly man.\nWatch out for blowhards. There are a lot of them out there and they are\nvery negative influences. They can stop you from getting started, from\ngetting going, from taking a massive running leap into the dark. Always\nremember that they want you to fail, just as they did. Ignore them.\nThat clock is still ticking. It's been travelling at the speed of light while\nyou read all this. Now is the time. Now is the hour. Let's go. Come on,\nbrother and sister, up off your idle butt. Let's find ourselves a gazelle with\ndiamonds in its entrails.\nTime to go. Let's GO! GO! GO!\nLet's go and get rich!"

    "raw_text": "THE UPSIDE-DOWN PYRAMID FOR GETTING RICH\n1. Commit or don't commit. No half-measures.\n2, Cut loose from all negative influences.\n3. Choose the right mountain.\n4. Fear nothing,\n5. Start now.\n6. Go!\n\f\n1 8\nHOW TO\nSTAY RICH\nSo on we worked, and waited for the light,\nAnd went without meat, and cursed the bread;\nAnd Richard Cory, one dark summer night,\nWent home and put a bullet through his head.\nEDWARD ARLINGTON ROBINSON, 'RICHARD CORY'\nYou can skip this chapter if you want. It won't help you to get rich. But it\nmight help you stay rich. Big difference.\nIt's been fun. Writing this book, I mean. It's taken me nearly eight\nweeks. But I have to get back to work now - planting trees, writing poetry,\nmaking money. That sort of thing. So this chapter is an 'extra', if you like.\nI'm writing it because I'm enjoying myself.\nTHE PERILS OF WEALTH\nI'm no great prose writer (and no great philosopher, either) but I've read a\nlot and lived a lot and made a lot and spent a lot - and played the fool with\nit all to a highly satisfactory degree. Hundreds of millions of dollars have\n'trickled down' (to use Margaret Thatcher's much-mocked, much-used\nphrase) from my leaky fingers into the general economy and the outstretched\nhands of various trades and professions and charities.\nWine and narcotic suppliers did exceptionally well out of me over the\nyears. So did real-estate agents, book sellers, young ladies of easy virtue and\nupmarket British car manufacturers.\nI spent a hell of a lot of what I made on sex and drugs and rock 'n' roll.\nThe rest - as the footballer, Georgie Best, joked just before he died recently\n- I wasted. It's the usual old story. But whores have to make a living and so\ndo purveyors of French wine and single malt whisky.\n(To be serious for a moment, some of the smartest, nicest people I ever\nmet in my life were whores. But only one of them, out of the hundreds I\nhave known, ever got rich. A Saudi Prince picked her up in a nightclub. The\nrest is history. But she was one in a million. Whoring is a particularly danger-\nous and ineffective way of getting rich.)\n\f\nI'm afraid that the crack dealers have had a pretty thin time over the last\nten years from me because I gave it all up in a Damascene conversion. But I\ndid more than my bit for them in my foolish forties. Drugs can be great, for\na while, as I am forced to admit to my godchildren. Anyone who tells you\notherwise is either lying or ignorant. But they will very often kill you and\nwreck your life. That is the problem. And, while they do it, they stop you\nfrom getting rich. Better to forget about drugs and move on.\nAs for the wine merchants, I've been keeping careful count. By my reck-\noning, I have bought £790,000 worth of French wine over the last twenty\nyears. When I reach a million quid, I'm applying to the Frogs for a legion\nd'honneur for services rendered. I won't get one, but the French wine trade,\nwhen they read about it in the newspapers, will probably send a certificate\nand a pretty ribbon for le madman rosbif. Maybe even a free crate or two of\nChateau Petrus!\nWho else have I 'trickled down' my dosh to? Thousands of people have\nearned their living working at companies I founded or co-founded and\nhundreds still continue to do so. Printers and paper manufacturers, of course\n- but that's a cost of doing business and doesn't really count.\nLawyers - they always do well. Accountants, and tax advisors, naturally.\nCharities have done very nicely. Farmers have sold me thousands and thou-\nsands of acres of land they no longer needed. And banks have made a pretty\npenny from yours truly over the years. And art dealers. And Persian rug  \ndeal-\ners. And architects. And restaurant owners.\nOh, and the tax man. How could I forget him? One year I paid £10\nmillion to the UK tax authorities - or maybe it was twenty million. I forget.\nAnd they still tried to make me pay interest because I was one day late with\nthat cheque, the rotters. When the story got out, the newsreader Trevor\nMcDonald used it on News at Ten in his signature 'And finally...' slot.\nHilarious stuff- even the Inland Revenue thought so - but I still had to pay\nthem that one day's money.\nBy the way, I always pay the Inland Revenue by old-fashioned cheque\nrather than by electronic transfer whenever I can. That way, I have a Xerox\ncopy of the cheque to pin up on my kitchen wall as a memento (there are a\nlot of them on that wall) and the Revenue tend to lose a day or so's interest\nto the clearing banks. Now two days' interest on £20 million would be, er...\noh, eight or nine thousand pounds, give or take. That's how clearing banks\nget rich. I'd rather the banks got rich than the taxman."

    "raw_text": "So is it true that 'Whoever Dies with the Most Toys Wins'?\nNaaah. That's rubbish. It's like 'Greed is Good', which came later. Greed\nain't good. And toys are the last thing on your mind, lying on a bed of ice\nand fire white nonchalant young ticks in white coats pull a face like they're\nsucking a lemon before pronouncing your doom. You won't be worrying\nabout toys and gadgets then, except perhaps the respirator.\nMaking a lot of money is like piloting a ship. You cease to be a person to\nmany others. You become, instead, a freighter loaded to the gills with ingots.\nThey want some of that gold and they will go to any ends to get it, the worst\nof them.\nHere's John Donne, ostensibly writing about naval warfare, but he isn't,\nyou know.\nA Burnt Ship\nOut of a fired ship, which, by no way\nBut drowning, could he rescued from the flames,\nSome men leap'd forth, and ever as they came\nNeere the foe's ships, did by their shot decay;\nSo all were lost, which in the ship were found,\nThey in the sea being burnt, they in the burnt ship drowned.\nHe was clever dick, the preacher Donne. You'll have to watch you are neither\nburnt nor drowned when you're the master of your own laden galleon. Wait\nand see.\nA lot of it I've given away. To friends, to good causes and charities and\nthe arts and children's education and relatives and to anything that took my\nfancy in the newspaper that day. And to planting trees.\nSeems daft, doesn't it? What was the point, then? Well, I can't tell you\nwhat the point of making all that money was. Just because I could, I suppose.\nAnd because I hated being poor all those years ago. Mind you, I'm still far\nfrom poor. And I'm not finished yet, either. Not by a long chalk.\nBut it will all go eventually. Where it belongs. Back into the hands of\nthose who need it and, perhaps, to some who don't. But let's not get\nmaudlin. Here's a poem to cheer you up.\n\f\nPitch and Toss\nFor thirty years, at pitch and toss,\nIn Mammon's inky halls,\nI hurled benighted dice across\nThe stone of hazard's walls,\nAnd little reckoned win or loss.\nThe game was all; the rest was dross.\nAs living ghosts, a world apart,\nWe toiled in lucre's maze,\nThe sun shut out of each man's heart,\nThe glittering lamps ablaze;\nWe little reckoned stop from start,\nThe Midas touch was all our art.\nIn frenzied play, at fever pitch,\nWe sought to build our store,\nWhile Lady Luck, that slattern bitch,\nWould taunt us from the door;\nWe little reckoned who was which:\nThe newly poor, the newly rich.\nAnd there I built my dragon hoard\nOf silver and of gold,\nAnd bound it with a miser's cord\nTo gnaw when I grew old.\nAnd little reckoned fire or sword,\nAnd thought myself a mighty lord.\n'Til, falling sick at last, I stepped\nTo seek the open sky,\nTo bribe the guards with all I'd kept\nTo lead me out to die.\nI little reckoned as I wept\nThat joy into my soul had crept."

    "raw_text": "But joy in want, is joy deferred,\nAnd paupers' lives are short,\nfat worms are for the early bird\nAnd I was fit for nought;\nA fool might reckon what occurred:\nThey took me back without a word.\nSo did I learn anything? Anything you might find useful when you become\nrich yourself? Yes, I did. Here are a few truths I discovered the hard way,\nsome of them concerned with the immediate aftermath of getting rich,\nand some concerned with staying rich, not to mention relatively sane.\nRelatively, mind.\nO Keep giving it away.  The faster you give it away, the more money will\nflow back to you. Not because of 'karrna' or 'universal cosmic forces', but\nbecame you then spend less time defending it and more time making more\nof it. Investing in private companies you think can do well is another sensi-\nble ruse to staying rich, but giving it away on a continual basis is a surer\nroute. By the way, when you do start giving it away, find someone to do it\nfor you. Most of my money is given away by a lovely lady accountant called\nCatherine Bishop, and she does a far better job of it than I.\nO As soon as you've spent it, gifted it, loaned it or invested it, forget\nit. More angst and worry comes into the world from concern over past\ninvestments, loans or gifts than can be imagined. It's gone, forget it. If any\nof it returns to you, fine. But that should not be your primary concern,\nunless you invested for safety's sake. Which is a different matter. All you did\nwith that type of 'investment' was take a punt or make a gift. Do not waste\ntime playing the 'blame game' over investments, loans or outright gifts,\nhowever large. The blame, if there is any, is yours,\nO Never loan it to friends.  If you loan money to a friend, you will lose\nyour friend as well as your money. Give them whatever you feel like giving.\nThen forget it. Ditto with relatives. If you diligently follow this one piece of\nadvice, you wilt be saved a sackful of misery. Trust me. Broadcast your policy\nloudly. This will spare you from many embarrassing demands that will other-\nwise vex you.\nO Get 'first flush' barminess out of your system as fast as possible.\nYou're going to do it if you get rich. Yes, you are. You are going to buy a\nsodding great big house, then more houses abroad, then servants by any\nother name, then you are going to start misbehaving. Gambling. Credit-card"

    "raw_text": "abuse. Expensive clothes. Whores. Drugs. Drink. Fast cars. Private jets. Big\nparties. Interior designers. Gold taps. The lot. This probably can't be\navoided. But the sooner you can work through this 'barmy' phase, the better\nyour health will stand up, and the sooner you will get your second wind.\nO Your oldest friends are your only friends.  Sad. Very sad. But true. And\nnot alt those old friends will be comfortable with the new disparity in wealth\nbetween you and them. You'll have to wait and see which. And, surprisingly,\nyou will have to work on those friendships for quite a while. They're impor-\ntant to you, believe me. Only your old, trusted mates can tell you when to\nget off. Will dare tell you that you're out of order. But why should you have\nto reach out to them? Because ...\nO Get used to being 'cut off'.  I do not carry a mobile phone or any\ncommunications device on my person. At least, not one anyone knows\nanything about. No one has my email address, because I refuse to register\none. I never will. I am very hard to reach and that's deliberate. Only a very\nfew trusted aides, business associates and my lover can reach me day or night.\nAnd sometimes, not even then. If you do not begin to isolate yourself pronto\nwhen you get rich, then you will be driven mad pretty swiftly. At least that's\nmy experience. It isn't that you have changed so much, (although believe me,\nyou have), it is simply that you are now a loaded galleon, a supertanker, and\nall the pirates have lookouts. There just isn't enough time in the world to\ndeal with them all. Avoid them instead.\nO Avoid developing 'plate-glass vision'.  It's true you want to be  \ndifficult\nto reach, but that doesn't mean you should allow yourself to develop what\nBob Dylan called 'plate-glass vision'. No need for that. I often eat at the\nsame small restaurants I always did in London and New York. They know\nI've done well, but the staff there have no idea how well. I drop by my\ncompanies without notice and chew the fat with employees and managers\nregularly. I invite many of them to visit me at my private office, one on one.\nEven with my poetry, I go on the road on long tours and let the audience\ntell me what they think, face to face. In Mustique, I often invite yachtie\nstrangers I've met at the local bar up for a shower and a drink or a meal - to\ntheir astonishment, usually. 'Plate-glass vision' won't make you poor, but it\nwill drive you crazy.\nO Develop a passion outside of making money.  Fast. If I had made the\ntime earlier to discover that I could write poetry that thousands of people\nwould be kind enough to purchase and enjoy, I would have saved myself  \nmany\n\f\ntorments of the pit. People who can make money are often easily bored.  \nThat\nis true of me. So when the day's work was finally done, I used to make my  \nown\nentertainment. There's nothing intrinsically wrong with orgies, parties,\nnarcotics and booze - but they will kill you in the end. If I had spent the  \nthou-\nsands of nights writing poetry that I spent playing the fool to keep boredom\nat bay, I would be a happier, healthier man today. And a better poet to boot!\nO Get your own private advisors.  The professionals who help run your\ncompany must be first class. The professionals who run your private wealth\nfor you must be even classier. There is no substitute for a first-class lawyer,\ntax advisor, accountant, auditor, estate manager and business advisor. None.\nYou will get into a ton of trouble if you don't search them out, appoint\nthem, and make your peace with them at the earliest opportunity. Avoid the\nerrors I made in my first few years of being rich. Do this earlier than you\nthink is necessary. You'll understand why later.\nO Watch out for fraud in the early days.  When you first hit pay dirt,  \nyou\nwill not have the systems in place to detect fraud swiftly. That happened to\nme. A bent accountant siphoned off tens of thousands of pounds from my\ncompany before he was caught. That was a lot of money back then. Money\nI could not afford. (The scumbag's name was Ian F . You see, I\nhaven't forgotten, Ian, you little toad.) How was he caught? He went on\nholiday and his deputy got suspicious of some stuff she found in the mail.\nNever trust a senior accountant who will not use their allotted vacation time!\nAnd install good accounting systems the second you can afford it.\nO Do not try to be friends with your staff.  When you are worth several\nhundred or a thousand times what a member of your staff is worth  \nfinancially\n(do the math), then trying to be friends with them or encouraging them to\nbe friends with you is silly. They know it's phony and you know it's phony, \nand\nthey know that you know. Not being friends comes with the territory. Being\nfair and friendly is always cool. Trying to be 'one of the boys' is pathetic.\nO Do not sleep with your staff.  It's dumb. It's unfair. And it sucks.  \nPeriod.\n\f\nO Choose personal aides with enormous care.  You may spend more  \ntime\nwith your PA, your chauffeur or your business manager than with your\nhusband, wife or lover. Or even, sadly, than with your children. If a personal\naide is not working out, then fire him or her just as soon as you know. But\nbe very generous when you do so. Tell them it's your fault - it probably is.\nClose aides like these can become your friends, and usually do, over time.\nThat's understandable. But try to keep a little distance 'just in case'. Ensure\nthey are employed under a very different contract than employees of your\ncompany. They must work for you, not your company.\nO Don't abuse it.  The maitre d' in your favourite restaurant doesn't mind\nbeing verbally abused. He's paid to be. He knows you will have to award  \nhim\na huge tip next time if you want that 'special' table. Even your close aides  \nwill\nbe prepared to put up with the odd temper tantrum and hissy fit. But your\ncompany's employees are not paid on that basis, and nor are the employees of\nother companies you come into contact with. They most certainly do not\nappreciate being verbally assaulted. Oddly, I could shout and rage a lot easier\nin the old days with my company staff. We were all in it together, then. And\nanyway, they shouted right back. But not now. Unless you are a president,\nmanaging director or CEO of your company, keep your feelings about an\nemployee's abilities to yourself in public. Being rich doesn't give you the right\nto abuse anyone.\nO Be safe. If you make a lot of money, then it's foolish not to look to your\nsecurity. Even speaking to 'security advisors' is weird - you feel like a fraud or\na B-movie actor. Get over that. Quickly. No need to get paranoid about it, but\neffective security for you and your family has to become a priority. If you get\nrich enough, you will end up with your own security force, as I have. It's a\npain, and I still feel like a fraud, but the alternative isn't worth contemplating.\nO Never stop looking for talent and promoting talent.  This single\nsuggestion will keep anyone rich. Talent is all most companies consist of.\nTalented people are crucial to keeping your company humming right along\nand growing. As the owner, you have the right to seek out talent, both inside\nand outside of your company. You have the right to insist it is promoted or\nhired. Make use of that last right. If you get known for making use of it, the\ntalent will start coming to you.\nO No deal is a 'must-do' deal.  It's easy to get carried away when you are\nin pursuit of a sweet deal. But more entrepreneurs get themselves in trouble"

Your\nemployees and advisors are just that: employees and advisors. You are the\nowner. You must follow your instincts. You must lead.\nO Stay as healthy as you can.  I have no advice to offer on this subject -\nand no right to offer any. I'm rich, not a hypocrite. But staying healthy long\nenough to enjoy your wealth must make some kind of sense.\nO If you're bored with a business, sell it.  You will not be able to disguise\nyour lack of passion for a business if you fall out of love with it. Your lack of\nenthusiasm leaks out of you and infects those around you. They can sense it\nand they will find it hard to forgive and easy to emulate. Sell that particular\nbusiness pronto. Then go and invest in something that doesn't bore you.\nO Try to sell before you have to.  You're an entrepreneur. Your compa-\nnies are not your 'babies', they are tools for acquiring wealth. Try to sell\nthem before they peak. Buyers require what is called 'blue sky' (further\ngrowth) to get excited and offer a great price. I'm bad at this, sometimes.\nFortunately, my American partners, Peter and Bob, are good at it. And,\nusually, they are right.\nO Retirement will kill you.  It's official! Retirement kills the kind of people\nwho make their own pile. I do know one couple, old friends called Don and\nSue, who squirrelled away a million bucks or two (plus a house) and travel\nquite happily, and very modestly, for most of the year. They go to India and\nIndonesia and other such places. Or else stay with friends, like me. They love\ntheir life, and are content to live on the interest from their investments. But\nthey are the only ones I know who ever really retired contented.\nInterestingly, Don always predicted he would retire early; long before he\nmade any money. Still, for most men and women who have made a lot of\nmoney, retirement is usually a living death sentence.\n\f\nO Remember you are only richer than them.  Not smarter than them.\nIf you do not employ a great many people smarter than you in your\ncompany, you are either Albert Einstein reincarnated or a fool. Making\nmoney doesn't mean you are smart. Having a posh car, a fancy office and\nwearing a $5,000 suit doesn't make you smart. Being surrounded by tech-\nnology, research and cool gadgets does not make you smart. Living in a big\nhouse does not make you smart. It makes you rich. The sun does not shine\nout of your backside. You are not infallible. You are neither the Pope nor\nAlbert Einstein.\nHere's my favourite story about the 'infallibility' of power. It concerns a\nman in charge of a billion dollars' worth of machinery who thinks he knows\neverything. The transcript was released (rather mischievously) by the chief of\nBritish Naval Operations in 1995, from a recorded radio conversation over-\nheard at sea near the coast of British Columbia.\nNavy voice:      Please divert your course 15 degrees to the north to\navoid a collision.\nCivilian voice:  Recommend you divert your course 15 degrees to the\nsouth to avoid a collision.\nNavy voice:      This is the captain of a US navy ship. I say again, divert\nyour course.\nCivilian voice:  No. I say again, divert your course.\nNavy voice:      This is the aircraft carrier Enterprise. We are a large\nwarship of the US navy. Divert your course now!\nChilian voice: This is a lighthouse. Your call.\nOh, boy. Naturally, that officer of the watch can never have lived it down.\nHe will be nicknamed 'Your Call' or 'Lighthouse' until the day he retires. All\nthose years of saluting and keeping his nose to the grindstone destroyed in\nmoments, because he believed the sun shone out of his backside.\nCan you imagine saluting such a man? You would be giggling uncon-\ntrollably in seconds. Screw 'infallibility' and bring on the Awkward Squad.\nThese are the senior professionals and talent you have installed in your\norganisation. If they are paid and incentivised right, you will not be able to\npersuade them that the 'moon is made of Stilton cheese' or that you are\ninfallible. That's what you employed them for in the first place, remember?\nSo you could get rich and stay rich.\n\f\nIt's your call. Believe in your own bullshit and grow steadily poorer, or\nlisten to the people you employ and get richer and richer. I tried it the first\nway in the early days. When that didn't work, I got sensible and started a\npolicy of deliberately employing men and women who were smarter than I\nwas - and listening to them. It works every time.\nThe trick to staying rich is balance. I guess Lao Tsu, or whoever it was\nwrote the Tao Te Ching back in the sixth century EC, would say that all of\nlife, all of existence, is about balance. By seeking to make oneself richer  \nthan\none's neighbour, that balance is destroyed.\nAnd maybe Lao Tsu was right.\nBut it is amazing how many philosophers and academics and wise men I\nhave ended up paying the restaurant bill for, over the years. Call me cynical.\nCall me whatever you like - I probably deserve it. But I just don't think I\nwas put on this earth to wax philosophical too often, except occasionally in\nmy poetry.\nI was put on this earth to get rich. To collect money that already had my\nname on it.\nAnd then to give it all away.\nNow there's balance for you!\nStay rich!\n\f\n1 9\nTHE EIGHT\nSECRETS TO\nGETTING RICH\nTHE EIGHT SECRETS TO GETTING RICH\n1.Analyse your need. Desire is insufficient. Compulsion is mandatory.\n2.Cut loose from negative influences. Never give in. Stay the course.\n3.Ignore 'great ideas'. Concentrate on great execution.\n4.Focus. Keep your eye on the ball marked 'The Money Is Here'.\n5.Hire talent smarter than you. Delegate. Share the annual pie.\n6.Ownership is the real 'secret'. Hold on to every percentage point you can.\n7.Sell before you need to, or when bored. Empty your mind when nego-\ntiating.\n8.Fear nothing and no one. Get rich. Remember to give it all away.\nFear not. For fear itself is fed by fear,\nAnd all fears pass. Did no one tell you so?\nCome take my hand, my friend, and we will peer\nInto this fear's abyss. And jump! And know.\nThere are secrets and mysteries in the world. I doubt, however, that many of\nthem are of much consequence to the subject of this little book.\nLooking for the 'secret' to getting rich is not a sensible exercise. If there\nare such secrets, then I have never discovered them.\nBut, as humans love lists and 'secrets', here is my best shot at a very short\nlist. A kind of 'secret' recap. The essence, if you will, of what I have learned\nalong the way. (Strangely, compiling such a list is rather like writing a poem.\nYou have to strip out any word not absolutely essential. Like the word\n'absolutely', for instance!)"

K CHESTERTON , 'A SONG OF DEFEAT'\nSo that's it. That's how I got rich and how you can, too. If you want to. I\nwon't blame you if you don't. Far from it. There are far more important things\nin life than money. (Spoken like the rich, hypocritical beastie you are, Dennis!)\nIt may well be that I have unintentionally led you astray. The middle-\naged and the old are always doing that to the young. Just as any system leads\nus astray. In the words of John Gall, writing about 'Systemantics' twenty\nyears ago in The Whole Earth Catalogue:\nSystems tend to oppose their own proper function. Systems tend to\nmalfunction just after their greatest triumph. [We all] have a strong\ntendency to apply a previously successful strategy to the new challenge.\nThe army is now fully prepared to fight the last war.\nThere is truth in that. My 'system' may prove useless to you. But much of\nwhat I have written about was true long before the birth of capitalism, or\neven the beginning of recorded history, let alone the birth of 'Systemantics',\nwhatever that may be. Technology changes. Tools change. The social land-\nscape changes. Human nature does not change.\nIf you wish to make any comments concerning this book you can do so\nvia www.felixdennis.com. It's mainly an all-singing, all-dancing poetry site,\nbut there's a section set aside specially for How To Get Rich. I do not prom-\nise to answer comments or enquiries, but I do promise to read them all.\nWhile you are up on the site, check out my poetry and treat yourself to\none of my poetry collections. There's plenty of advice about getting rich\nin those!\nGood luck on your quest if you decide to undertake it. And remember\nthe words of Benjamin Jowett: 'Never retreat. Never explain. Get it done\nand let them howl.'\n\f\nThe first step? Just do it\nAnd bluff your way through it.\nRemember to duck!\nGod speed ...\nand Good Luck!"

    "raw_text": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis book was the result of a dinner conversation. I had written a review for\nthe business magazine Management Today about a book called Blink: The\nPower of Thinking Without Thinking by Malcolm Gladwell. He's the same\nchap who wrote The Tipping Point.\nOne of the guests around the table had read it. He thought it was OK;\nnot exactly sensational, but OK. 'Seems a bit silly to write a whole book\nabout one observation, though. He's talking about intuition, although he\nwon't use the word. What did you think, Felix?'\nI told him I thought it was bunkum. Snake oil. Just like every other so-\ncalled self-help book I ever stumbled away from at an airport bookstall.\n'What the world needs,' I thundered, 'is an anti-self-help book. A book that\ntells people how hard it is to be a great manager or a great anything. About\nhow hard it is to get rich. Bugger the glib insights!'\n'They'd never buy it,' my friend smiled, 'People buy dreams, they don't\nbuy reality. They want it made easy. They want a promise a fool could keep.'\n'We'll see,' I growled, an idea forming in my mind. 'Not one of those\nbooks was written by anyone who actually got rich - except by writing drivel\nfor cretins. And I've got my godchildren to be thinking of. Pass me the  \nwine,\nMarie-France. Hmmm, we'll see.' Marie-France rolled her eyes and passed\nme the wine.\nSo here we are with How to Get Rich. I want to thank Gail Rebuck, the\nboss of Random House UK, who invited me into her beautiful London\nhome and locked me up in a cupboard until I agreed to write it. I want to\nthank Sue Freestone at Hutchinson, to whom I originally sent my first\nsynopsis. And to my old friend, the agent Ed Victor, who let slip a pearl of\nwisdom when I mentioned the project in passing.\nAnd I especially need to thank my editor, Fiona MacIntyre, and her crew\nat Ebury. Perhaps they will all become very rich indeed after taking such care\nwith my manuscript. They certainly deserve to.\nI want to thank good friends, especially Don, Sue, Dick, Marion, Eric\nand Steve, who sat in my Mustique dining pavilion as I read them yet\nanother a new chapter, hot off the laser writer. 'Under a wide and starry sky',\nwhile the tree frogs whistled and the cicadas hummed in staccato unison, we\ndisputed points and chapters with all the vehemence and wit that only the\n\f\nblessing of good wine seems to provide - at least around my dinner table.\nSuzen Murakoshi gently reminded me, as she always does, to be kind but\nruthlessly honest in my book; otherwise there would be no point in it. This,\namong many others, is a particular talent of hers. Moni Mannings, too,\nbrought her talents to play with many insightful observations.\nI am grateful to Caroline Rush, my personal assistant, who shepherded\nthe whole project through its various incarnations. As I am to my other\nassistants, Wendy, Amy, Sharon, Michael and Toby, for keeping the world\nat bay while I wrote and wrote. Not to mention the guys and girls who run\nmy companies while I do such crazy tilings: Alistair Ramsay, Brett\nReynolds, Stephen Colvin, John Lagans and James Tye. And to Ian\nLeggett and Catherine Bishop who look after my money, and to David\nBliss who ensures the home fires, wherever they are, are not burning. To\nthem all, my thanks.\nAs to my long-time partners, Peter and Bob, they are the real heroes of\nthis book. Because, in truth, they helped me make most of my money. The\npair of them have never let me down. Not once in thirty years. Much of  \nwhat\nI learned along the way, I learned from them.\nThanks are due, too, to my old friend, the writer Chris Rowley, who I\nasked to do some research. Some research? Hah! Chris waded through fifty\nof those airport self-improvement manuals with names like Sleep Yourself  \ninto\nMaking Millions or Become a Genghis Khan Wall Street Warrior. Greater \nlove\nhath no man ...\nAnd to the companion of my heart, Marie-France, as always, and to my\nmother, who will not be pleased to read about herself in this book. But hey!\nI'm fifty-eight years old. A man has to stand up to his mother sooner or\nlater. Right?\nAnd to a tiny feral cat called Stringy, who crept around my writer's\ncottage on Mustique while I wrote all this. I can never mend her broken tail.\nBut she has allowed me to stroke her now. And soon, she will allow me to\npick her up. Smart as paint, like all her tribe, she has already discovered that\nthe vent from a refrigerator is the warmest place in an air-conditioned room.\nNot to mention that the very same refrigerator appears to contain an inex-\nhaustible supply of smoked salmon, milk and roast ham.\n\f\nLastly, I wish to say thank you to my fellow homeowners on Mustique, and\nto the Mustique Company, run by my friend the Hon. Brian Alexander, and\nto the people of St Vincent and the Grenadines, a country of which I am now\na proud citizen. Making money might be important, but so is getting away\nfrom it all. St Vincent and the Grenadines is the least spoilt group of islands in\nthe whole of the Caribbean. They are stunningly, heartbreakingly beautiful.\nMy advice to you, gentle reader, is to come here and visit the rain forest,\nthe volcano, the waterfalls, the empty, sun-kissed beaches and the quiet bays\nand keys. You will find a smiling face around each corner and a green flash\nin every sunset. This is as close to paradise as it gets. And you don't have to\nbe that rich to come join us!"
