### Sections. My wife, Anne Treisman, went through a lot and did a lot—I would have given up long ago without her steady support, wisdom, and endless patience.

#### Notes

##### Introduction

It is easy to be prone to collecting too few observations. We had read a book that criticized psychologists for using small samples, but did not explain their choices: Jacob Cohen, *Statistical Power Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences* (Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum, 1969).

There is a question about words. I have slightly altered the original wording, which referred to letters in the first and third position of words.

##### Negative View of the Mind

A prominent German psychologist has been our most persistent critic. Gerd Gigerenzer, “How to Make Cognitive Illusions Disappear,” *European Review of Social Psychology* 2 (1991): 83–115. Gerd Gigerenzer, “Personal Reflections on Theory and Psychology,” *Theory & Psychology* 20 (2010): 733–43. Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, “On the Reality of Cognitive Illusions,” *Psychological Review* 103 (1996): 582–91.

##### Offered Plausible Alternatives

Some examples from many are Valerie F. Reyna and Farrell J. Lloyd, “Physician Decision-Making and Cardiac Risk: Effects of Knowledge, Risk Perception, Risk Tolerance and Fuzzy-Processing,” *Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied* 12 (2006): 179–95. Nicholas Epley and Thomas Gilovich, “The Anchoring-and-Adjustment Heuristic,” *Psychological Science* 17 (2006): 311–18. Norbert Schwarz et al., “Ease of Retrieval of Information: Another Look at the Availability Heuristic,” *Journal of Personality & Social Psychology* 61 (1991): 195–202. Elke U. Weber et al., “Asymmetric Discounting in Intertemporal Choice,” *Psychological Science* 18 (2007): 516–23. George F. Loewenstein et al., “Risk as Feelings,” *Psychological Bulletin* 127 (2001): 267–86.

##### Nobel Prize that I Received

The prize awarded in economics is named the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. It was first given in 1969. Some physical scientists were not pleased with the addition of a Nobel Prize in social science, and the distinctive label of the economics prize was a compromise.

##### Prolonged Practice

Herbert Simon and his students at Carnegie Mellon in the 1980s set the foundations for our understanding of expertise. For an excellent popular introduction to the subject, see Joshua Foer, *Moonwalking with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering* (New York: Penguin Press, 2011). He presents work that is reviewed in more technical detail in K. Anders Ericsson et al., eds., *The Cambridge Handbook of Expertise and Expert Performance* (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2006).

##### Kitchen Was on Fire

Gary A. Klein, *Sources of Power* (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1999).

##### Studied Chess Masters

Herbert Simon was one of the great scholars of the twentieth century, whose discoveries and inventions ranged from political science (where he began his career) to economics (in which he won a Nobel Prize) to computer science (in which he was a pioneer) and to psychology.

“The situation…recognition”

##### Affect Heuristic

The concept of the affect heuristic was developed by Paul Slovic, a classmate of Amos’s at Michigan and a lifelong friend.

##### Without Noticing the Substitution

1: The Characters of the Story

##### Offered Many Labels

For reviews of the field, see Jonathan St. B. T. Evans and Keith Frankish, eds., *In Two Minds*: *Dual Processes and Beyond* (New York: Oxford University Press, 2009); Jonathan St. B. T. Evans, “Dual-Processing Accounts of Reasoning, Judgment, and Social Cognition,” *Annual Review of Psychology* 59 (2008): 25–59.

##### Subjective Experience of Agency

This sense of free will is sometimes illusory, as shown in Daniel M. Wegner, *The Illusion of Conscious Will* (Cambridge, MA: Bradford Books, 2003).

##### Attention Is Totally Focused Elsewhere

Nilli Lavie, “Attention, Distraction and Cognitive Control Under Load,” *Current Directions in Psychological Science* 19 (2010): 143–48.

##### Conflict Between the Two Systems

In the classic Stroop task, you are shown a display of patches of different colors, or of words printed in various colors. Your task is to call out the names of the colors, ignoring the words. The task is extremely difficult when the colored words are themselves names of color (e.g., GREEN printed in red, followed by YELLOW printed in green, etc.).

##### Psychopathic Charm

Professor Hare wrote me to say, “Your teacher was right,” in a letter I received on October 15, 2004. This is a letter that you have not been sent. Please do not send it to anyone. It is confidential.

##### Pupil of the Eye

Eckhard H. Hess, “Attitude and Pupil Size,” *Scientific American* 212 (1965): 46–54.

##### On the Subject’s Mind

The word *subject* reminds some people of subjugation and slavery, and the American Psychological Association enjoins us to use the more democratic participant. Unfortunately, the politically correct label is a mouthful, which occupies memory space and slows thinking. I will do my best to use participant whenever possible but will switch to subject when necessary.

##### Heart Rate Increases

Daniel Kahneman et al., “Pupillary, Heart Rate, and Skin Resistance Changes During a Mental Task,” *Journal of Experimental Psychology* 79 (1969): 164–67.

##### Rapidly Flashing Letters

Daniel Kahneman, Jackson Beatty, and Irwin Pollack, “Perceptual Deficit During a Mental Task,” *Psychological Review* 85 (1978): 203–22.
