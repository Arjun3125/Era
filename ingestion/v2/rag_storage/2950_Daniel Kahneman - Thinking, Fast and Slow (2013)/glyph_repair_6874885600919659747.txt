A theoretical analysis that assumes loss aversion predicts a pronounced kink of the indifference curve at the reference point: Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, "Loss Aversion in Riskless Choice: A Reference-Dependent Model," Quarterly Journal of Economics 106 (1991): 1039–61. Jack Knetsch observed these kinks in an experimental study: "Preferences and Nonreversibility of Indifference Curves," Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization 17 (1992): 131–39.

did not own the bottle

Technically, the theory allows the buying price to be slightly lower than the selling price because of what economists call an "income effect": The buyer and the seller are not equally wealthy, because the seller has an extra bottle. However, the effect in this case is negligible since $50 is a minute fraction of the professor's wealth. The theory would predict that this income effect would not change his willingness to pay by even a penny.

would be puzzled by it

The economist Alan Krueger reported on a study he conducted on the occasion of taking his father to the Super Bowl: "We asked fans who had won the right to buy a pair of tickets for $325 or $400 each in a lottery whether they would have been willing to pay $3,000 a ticket if they had lost in the lottery and whether they would have sold their tickets if someone had offered them $3,000 apiece. Ninety-four percent said they would not have bought for $3,000, and ninety-two percent said they would not have sold at that price." He concludes that "rationality was in short supply at the Super Bowl."

Strictly speaking, loss aversion refers to the anticipated pleasure and pain, which determine choices. These anticipations could be wrong in some cases. Deborah A. Kermer et al., "Loss Aversion Is an Affective Forecasting Error," Psychological Science 17 (2006): 649–53.

half of the tokens will change hands

Imagine that all the participants are ordered in a line by the redemption value assigned to them. Now randomly allocate tokens to half the individuals in the line. Half of the people in the front of the line will not have a token, and half of the people at the end of the line will own one. These people (half of the total) are expected to move by trading places with each other, so that in the end everyone in the first half of the line has a token, and no one behind them does.

The conclusion that money spent on purchases is not experienced as a loss is more likely to be true for people who are relatively well-off. The key may be whether you are aware when you buy one good that you will not be able to afford another good. Novemsky and Kahneman, "The Boundaries of Loss Aversion."
