kouros: The Getty Museum in Los Angeles brings in the world’s leading experts on Greek sculpture to view a kouros—a marble statue of a striding boy—that it is about to buy. One after another, the experts react with what one calls “intuitive repulsion”—a powerful hunch that the kouros is not 2,500 years old but a modern fake. None of the experts can immediately say why they think the sculpture is a forgery. The closest any of them could come to a rationale is an Italian art historian’s complaint that something—he does not know exactly what—“seemed wrong” with the statue’s fingernails. A famous American expert said that the first thought that came to his mind was the word “fresh,” and a Greek expert flatly stated, “Anyone who has ever seen a sculpture coming out of the ground could tell that that thing has never been in the ground.” The lack of agreement on the reasons for the shared conclusion is striking, and rather suspect.

admired as a hero: Simon was one of the towering intellectual figures of the twentieth century. He wrote a classic on decision making in organizations while still in his twenties, and among many other achievements he went on to be one of the founders of the field of artificial intelligence, a leader in cognitive science, an influential student of the process of scientific discovery, a forerunner of behavioral economics, and, almost incidentally, a Nobel laureate in economics.
