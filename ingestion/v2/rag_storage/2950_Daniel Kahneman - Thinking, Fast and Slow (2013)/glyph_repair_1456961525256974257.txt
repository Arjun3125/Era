Keeping Score

Drive into a blizzard:
The intuition was confirmed in a field experiment in which a random selection of students who purchased season tickets to the university theater received their tickets at a much reduced price. A follow-up of attendance revealed that students who had paid the full price for their tickets were more likely to attend, especially during the first half of the season. Missing a show one has paid for involves the unpleasant experience of closing an account in the red. Arkes and Blumer, "The Psychology of Sunk Costs."

habitually taking unreasonable risks:
The hitchhiker question was inspired by a famous example discussed by the legal philosophers Hart and Honoré: "A woman married to a man who suffers from an ulcerated condition of the stomach might identify eating parsnips as the cause of his indigestion. The doctor might identify the ulcerated condition as the cause and the meal as a mere occasion." Unusual events call for causal explanations and also evoke counterfactual thoughts, and the two are closely related. The same event can be compared to either a personal norm or the norm of other people, leading to different counterfactuals, different causal attributions, and different emotions (regret or blame):

reversals of judgment and choice:
The first step toward the current interpretation was taken by Max H. Bazerman, George F. Loewenstein, and Sally B. White, "Reversals of Preference in Allocation Decisions: Judging Alternatives Versus Judging Among Alternatives," Administrative Science Quarterly 37 (1992): 220-40. Christopher Hsee introduced the terminology of joint and separate evaluation, and formulated the important evaluability hypothesis, which explains reversals by the idea that some attributes become evaluable only in joint evaluation: "Attribute Evaluability: Its Implications for Joint-Separate Evaluation Reversals and Beyond," in Kahneman and Tversky, Choices, Values, and Frames.
