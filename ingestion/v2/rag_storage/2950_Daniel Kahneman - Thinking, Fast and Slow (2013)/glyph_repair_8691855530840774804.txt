In the days of my work on measuring experience, I saw Verdi’s opera La Traviata. Known for its gorgeous music, it is also a moving story about the love between a young aristocrat and Violetta, a woman from society’s underworld. The young man's father approaches Violetta and convinces her to give up her lover, to protect the family’s honor and the marriage prospects of his sister. In an act of supreme self-sacrifice, Violetta pretends to reject the man she loves. She soon relapses into consumption (the nineteenth-century term for tuberculosis). In the final act, Violetta lies dying, surrounded by a few friends. Her beloved has been alerted and is rushing to Paris to see her. When he arrives, she is transformed with hope and joy, but she is also deteriorating quickly.

No matter how many times you have seen the opera, you are gripped by the tension and fear of that moment: Will the young lover arrive in time? There is a sense that it is immensely important for him to join his beloved before she dies. He does, and after 10 minutes of glorious music, Violetta dies.

On my way home from the opera, I wondered: Why do we care so much about those last 10 minutes? I quickly realized that I did not care at all about the length of Violetta’s life. If I had been told she died at age 27, not 28 as I believed, the news that she missed a year of happy life would not have moved me at all. But the possibility of missing the last 10 minutes mattered greatly.

Furthermore, the emotion I felt about the lovers’ reunion would not have changed if I had learned they actually had a week together instead of just 10 minutes. If the lover had come too late, however, La Traviata would have been an altogether different story.

A story is about significant events and memorable moments, not about time passing. Duration neglect is normal in a story, and the ending often defines its character. The same core features appear in the rules of narratives and in the memories of colonoscopies, vacations, and films. This is how the remembering self works: it composes stories and keeps them for future reference.

It is not only at the opera that we think of life as a story and wish it to end well. When we hear about the death of a woman who had been estranged from her daughter for many years, we want to know whether they were reconciled as death approached. We do not care only about the daughter’s feelings—it is the narrative of the mother’s life that we wish to improve.

Caring for people often takes the form of concern for the quality of their stories, not for their feelings. Indeed, we can be deeply moved even by events that change the stories of people who are already dead. We feel pity for a man who died believing in his wife's love for him when we hear that she had a lover for many years and stayed with her husband only for his money. We pity the husband although he had lived a happy life.

We feel the humiliation of a scientist who made an important discovery that was proved false after her death, although she did not experience the humiliation. Most importantly, we all care intensely for the narrative of our own lives and very much want it to be a good story with a decent hero.

The psychologist Ed Diener and his students wondered whether duration neglect and the peak-end rule would govern evaluations of entire lives. They used a short description of the life of a fictitious character called Jen, a never-married woman with no children who died instantly and painlessly in an automobile accident. In one version of Jen’s story, she was extremely happy throughout her life (which lasted either 30 or 60 years), enjoying her work, taking vacations, spending time with her friends, and engaging in hobbies.

Another version added 5 extra years to Jen’s life, who now died either at age 35 or 65. The extra years were described as pleasant but less so than before. After reading a schematic biography of Jen, each participant answered two questions: “Taking her life as a whole, how desirable do you think Jen's life was?” and “How much total happiness or unhappiness would you say that Jen experienced in her life?”

The results provided clear evidence of both duration neglect and a peak-end effect. In a between-subjects experiment (different participants saw different forms), doubling the duration of Jen’s life had no effect whatsoever on the desirability of her life, or on judgments of the total happiness that Jen experienced. Clearly, her life was represented by a prototypical slice of time, not as a sequence of time slices. As a consequence, her “total happiness” was the happiness of a typical period in her lifetime, not the sum (or integral) of happiness over the duration of her life.

As expected from this idea, Diener and his students also found a less-is-more effect, a strong indication that an average (prototype) has been substituted for a sum. Adding 5 “slightly happy” years to a very happy life caused a substantial drop in evaluations of the total happiness of that life.

At my urging, they also collected data on the effect of the extra 5 years in a within-subject experiment; each participant made both judgments in immediate succession. In spite of my long experience with judging the desirability and total happiness of lives, I found myself surprised by the results. It is clear that our brains are programmed to focus on the most intense moments and the end of an event when we assess its overall value.

The remembering self’s tendency to neglect duration in favor of peak and end events is not unique to human experience. We see it in colonoscopies, where patients report more pain during the procedure than during the recovery period; in vacations, where memories of the highlights overshadow the everyday experiences; and even in our own lives, where we often remember the most dramatic moments over the years that were filled with smaller but important events.

In conclusion, our tendency to focus on peak and end events when assessing the value of an experience is a fundamental aspect of human cognition. While it can make us miss out on the everyday pleasures and memories that accumulate over time, it also helps us create vivid and meaningful stories that shape how we understand our lives.
