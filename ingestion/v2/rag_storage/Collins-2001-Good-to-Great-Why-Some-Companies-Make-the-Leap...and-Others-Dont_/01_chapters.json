How can good companies, mediocre compa\nnies, even bad companies achieve enduring greatness?\nTHE STUDY\nFor years, this guestion preyed on the mind of Jim\nCollins. Are there companies that defy gravity and con\nvert long-term mediocrity or worse into long-term\nsuperiority? And if so, what are the universal distin\nguishing characteristics that cause a company to go\nfrom good to great?\nTHE STANDARDS\nUsing tough benchmarks, Collins and his research team\nidentified a set of elite companies that made the leap\nto great results and sustained those results for at least\nfifteen years. How great? After the leap, the good-to-\ngreat companies generated cumulative stock returns\nthat beat the general stock market by an average of\nseven times in fifteen years, better than twice the\nresults delivered by a composite index of the world's\ngreatest companies, including Coca-Cola, Intel, General\nElectric, and Merck.\nTHE COMPARISONS\nThe research team contrasted the good-to-great\ncompanies with a carefully selected set of comparison\ncompanies that failed to make the leap from good to\ngreat. What was different? Why did one set of compa\nnies become truly great performers while the other set\nremained only good?\nOver five years, the team analyzed the histories of\nall twenty-eight companies in the study. After sifting\nthrough mountains of data and thousands of pages of\ninterviews, Collins and his crew discovered the key\ndeterminants of greatness—why some companies make\nthe leap and others don't.\n(continued on back flap) 1001\n\f\nGOOD TO GREAT\n\f\nA L SO BY JIM CO L L IN S\nBuilt to hast\n(with Jerry I.

In all, twenty-onepeopleworked on theprojectat key points,usu\nallyin teams of four tosix at a time.)\nOur first task was to find companiesthatshowedthe good-to-greatpat\ntern exemplifiedin the chart onpage 2.Welaunched a six-month\"death\nmarch offinancialanalysis,\"lookingfor companiesthat showed the fol-\n\f\n6 Jim Collins\nlowingbasic pattern:fifteen-yearcumulativestockreturns at or below the\ngeneral stock market, punctuated by atransitionpoint, then cumulative\nreturns at least three times the market over the next fifteen years. We\npicked fifteen years because it would transcend one-hit wonders and\nlucky breaks (you can't justbe luckyfor fifteenyears) and would exceed\nthe averagetenure ofmostchief executiveofficers(helpingus toseparate\ngreat companies from companiesthat just happened to have a single\ngreat leader). We picked three times the market because it exceeds the\nperformance of most widely acknowledgedgreat companies. For per\nspective,a mutual fund ofthe following\"marquisset\"of companiesbeat\nthe market by only 2.5 times over the years 1985 to 2000: 3M, Boeing,\nCoca-Cola, GE, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Johnson & Johnson, Merck,\nMotorola,Pepsi, Procter & Gamble,Wal-Mart,and Walt Disney. Not a\nbad set to beat.\nFrom an initialuniverseofcompaniesthat appearedon the Fortune 500\nin theyears 1965 to 1995,we systematicallysearchedand sifted,eventually\nfinding eleven good-to-greatexamples.(I've put a detaileddescriptionof\nour search in Appendix LA.) However, a couple of points deserve brief\nmention here.First,a companyhad to demonstratethe good-to-greatpat\ntern independentofits industry;ifthe whole industryshowedthe samepat\ntern, we dropped the company. Second, we debated whether we should\nuse additionalselectioncriteriabeyondcumulativestock returns,such as\nimpacton societyand employeewelfare.We eventuallydecided to limit\nour selectionto thegood-to-greatresultspattern,as we could notconceive\nof anylegitimateand consistentmethodforselectingon these othervari\nables withoutintroducingour own biases. In the lastchapter,however,I\naddressthe relationshipbetweencorporatevaluesand enduringgreatcom\npanies,but thefocus ofthis particularresearcheffortison the veryspecific\nquestionof how to turn a good organizationinto one that producessus\ntained great results.\nAtfirst glance,wewere surprisedbythe list.

The key question is, What systematicallydistin\nguishesgold medal winnersfrom those who neverwon a medal?\nWe selectedtwo sets of comparisoncompanies.The first set consisted\nof \"direct comparisons\"—companiesthat were in the same industry as\nthe good-to-greatcompanieswith the same opportunitiesand similar\nresourcesat the time of transition,but that showed no leap from good to\ngreat. (See AppendixLB for detailsofour selectionprocess.)The second\nconsistedof \"unsustainedcomparisons\"—companiesthat made a short-\nterm shift from good to great but failed to maintain the trajectory—to\naddressthe questionofsustainability.(SeeAppendixl.C.)

We col\nlected all articlespublished on the twenty-eightcompanies,dating back\nfifty years or more. We systematicallycoded all the material into cate\ngories, such as strategy, technology,leadership,and so forth. Then we\ninterviewedmostofthe good-to-greatexecutiveswhoheld keypositionsof\nresponsibilityduring the transitionera. We also initiateda wide range of\nqualitativeand quantitativeanalyses,lookingat everythingfrom acquisi\ntions to executivecompensation,from businessstrategyto corporate cul\nture, from layoffsto leadershipstyle,from financialratiosto management\nturnover. When all was said and done, the total project consumed 10.5\npeopleyears of effort.We read andsystematicallycoded nearly6,000 arti\ncles, generated more than 2,000 pages of interviewtranscripts,and cre\nated 384million bytesofcomputer data. (SeeAppendixl.D fora detailed\nlist of all ouranalysesand activities.)\nWe came to think ofourresearcheffortasakinto lookinginsidea black\nbox. Each step alongthe way was like installinganotherlightbulbto shed\nlighton the inner workingsofthe good-to-greatprocess.\nGood Results\nGreat Results\nWhat's Inside\nthe\nBlack Box?\nWith data in hand, we began aseries of weekly research-teamdebates.\nFor each of the twenty-eightcompanies,members of the research team\nand I would systematicallyread all the articles,analyses,interviews,and\nthe researchcoding.I would make a presentationto the team on that spe\ncificcompany,drawingpotentialconclusionsand askingquestions.Then\nwe would debate,disagree,pound on tables, raise our voices, pause and\n\f\n10 Jim Collins\nreflect,debatesomemore,pauseand think, discuss,resolve,question,and\ndebate yet again about \"whatit allmeans.\"\nThe core of our method was a systematicprocess of contrasting the\ngood-to-greatexamplesto the comparisons,always asking,\"What's differ\nent?\"\nWe also made particularnote of\"dogs that did not bark.\" In the Sher\nlock Holmes classic \"The Adventureof Silver Blaze\" Holmes identified\n\"the curiousincident ofthe dogin the night-time\"as the keyclue. It turns\nout that the dog did nothing in the nighttime and that, according to\nHolmes, was the curious incident, which led him to the conclusion that\nthe primesuspectmusthave been someonewhoknewthe dog well.\nIn ourstudy,whatwe didn'tfind—dogsthat wemight haveexpectedto\nbark but didn't—turned out to be some of the best clues to the inner work\nings of good to great. When we stepped inside the black box and turned\non the lightbulbs,we werefrequentlyjustas astonishedat what we didnot\nsee as what we did. Forexample:\n• Larger-than-life,celebrity leaders who ride in from the outside are\nnegativelycorrelatedwith takinga companyfrom good togreat. Ten\nof eleven good-to-great CEOs came from inside the company,\nwhereas the comparison companies tried outside CEOs six times\nmore often.\n• We found no systematicpattern linking specific forms of executive\ncompensation to the process of going from good to great. The idea\nthat the structure ofexecutivecompensationis a keydriverin corpo\nrate performance is simplynot supported by the data.\n• Strategyper se did notseparatethe good-to-greatcompaniesfrom the\ncomparison companies. Both sets of companies had well-defined\nstrategies,and there is no evidencethat the good-to-greatcompanies\nspent more time on long-rangestrategicplanning than the compari\nson companies.\n\f\nGood to Great 11\n• The good-to-greatcompaniesdid not focus principallyon what todo\nto become great;they focused equallyon what notto do and what to\nstop doing.\n• Technologyand technology-drivenchangehas virtuallynothingto do\nwith ignitinga transformationfrom good to great. Technologycan\nacceleratea transformation,but technologycannot cause a transfor\nmation.\n• Mergersand acquisitionsplay virtuallyno role in ignitinga transfor\nmationfrom good togreat;two bigmediocritiesjoinedtogethernever\nmakeone great company.\n• The good-to-great companies paid scant attention to managing\nchange, motivatingpeople, or creatingalignment. Under the right\nconditions,the problemsofcommitment,alignment,motivation,and\nchange largelymelt away.\n• The good-to-greatcompanieshad noname,tagline, launchevent,or\nprogramto signifytheirtransformations.Indeed,some reportedbeing\nunaware of the magnitude of the transformationat the time; only\nlater,in retrospect,didit becomeclear.Yes, they produceda trulyrev\nolutionaryleap inresults,but not bya revolutionaryprocess.\n• The good-to-greatcompanieswere not, by and large, in great indus\ntries, and some were in terrible industries. In no case do we have a\ncompanythat justhappenedto besittingon thenose cone ofa rocket\nwhen it took off. Greatness is not a function of circumstance. Great\nness, it turns out, islargelya matterof consciouschoice.\nPhase 4: Chaos to Concept\nI've triedto come up with a simpleway toconveywhatwas requiredto go\nfrom all the data, analyses,debates,and \"dogs that did notbark\" to the\nfinal findingsin this book. The bestanswerI cangive is thatit was an iter\native processofloopingbackandforth, developingideasand testingthem\nagainstthe data, revisingthe ideas, buildinga framework,seeingit break\nunder the weight of evidence,and rebuildingit yetagain. That process\nwas repeatedover and over, until everythinghung togetherin a coherent\nframeworkofconcepts.We allhave a strengthortwo in life,and Isuppose\nmine is the ability to take a lump of unorganizedinformation,see pat\nterns,and extractorderfrom the mess—togo from chaosto concept.\nThat said, however,I wish to underscoreagain thatthe conceptsin the\nfinal frameworkare not my \"opinions.\"While I cannot extractmy own\n\f\n12 Jim Collins\npsychologyand biasesentirelyfrom the research,each finding in the final\nframeworkmet a rigorousstandardbeforethe researchteam would deem\nit significant.Everyprimaryconcept in the finalframeworkshowed up as\na change variablein 100 percent of thegood-to-greatcompaniesand in\nless than 30 percent of the comparison companies during the pivotal\nyears. Any insight thatfailed this test did not make it into the book as a\nchapter-levelconcept.\nHere, then, is an overviewof the frameworkof concepts and a preview\nof what'sto come in the restof thebook. (See thediagrambelow.)Think\nof the transformationas a process of buildup followed by breakthrough,\nbroken into three broad stages: disciplined people, disciplined thought,\nand disciplinedaction. Within each of these threestages, there are two\nkey concepts,shown in the frameworkand describedbelow. Wrapping\naround this entire frameworkis a concept we came to call the flywheel,\nwhich captures the gestalt of the entire process of going from good to\ngreat.\nLevel 5 First Who ... Confront the Hedgehog Culture of Technology\nLeadership Then What Brutal Facts Concept Discipline Accelerators\nLevel 5 Leadership.We were surprised,shocked really, to discoverthe\ntype of leadership required for turning a good company into a great one.\nCompared to high-profileleaderswith big personalitieswho make head\nlinesand become celebrities,the good-to-greatleadersseem to have come\nfrom Mars. Self-effacing,quiet, reserved, even shy—these leaders are a\n\f\nGood to Great 13\nparadoxicalblend of personal humilityand professionalwill. They are\nmore like Lincoln and Socrates than Patton or Caesar.\nFirstWho ... Then What We expectedthatgood-to-greatleaderswould\nbeginby settinga new visionand strategy.We found insteadthattheyfirst\ngotthe rightpeopleonthe bus, the wrongpeopleoffthe bus,and the right\npeoplein therightseats—andthen theyfiguredoutwhere to drive it.The\nold adage \"Peopleare your most importantasset\" turns out to bewrong.\nPeoplearenot your most importantasset. The right peopleare.\nConfrontthe BrutalFacts (Yet NeverLose Faith). We learnedthat afor\nmer prisonerofwar had more toteach us aboutwhat ittakes tofind a path\nto greatness than most books on corporate strategy. Every good-to-great\ncompany embraced what we came to call the StockdaleParadox:You must\nmaintainunwaveringfaith thatyou can and will prevailinthe end, regard\nless ofthe difficulties,AND at the same time have the disciplineto con\nfrontthe mostbrutalfacts ofyour currentreality,whateverthey mightbe.\nThe Hedgehog Concept (Simplicitywithin the Three Circles). To go\nfrom good to great requires transcendingthe curse of competence.Just\nbecausesomethingis your core business—justbecauseyou'vebeen doing\nit for years or perhapseven decades—doesnotnecessarilymean you can\nbe the bestin theworldat it.And ifyou cannotbe the bestin theworld at\nyour core business,then your core business absolutelycannotform the\nbasis ofa great company.It must be replacedwith a simple conceptthat\nreflectsdeep understandingofthree intersectingcircles.\nA CultureofDiscipline.All companieshave a culture,some companies\nhave discipline,butfew companieshave acultureofdiscipline.When you\nhave disciplinedpeople,you don'tneed hierarchy.When you have disci\nplinedthought,you don'tneed bureaucracy.When you have disciplined\naction,you don'tneed excessivecontrols.Whenyou combinea cultureof\ndisciplinewith anethicofentrepreneurship,you getthe magicalalchemy\nof greatperformance.\nTechnology Accelerators. Good-to-great companies think differently\nabout the role oftechnology.They never use technologyas the primary\nmeans ofignitinga transformation.Yet, paradoxically,they arepioneers\nin the applicationof carefully selected technologies.We learned that\n\f\n14 Jim Collins\ntechnologyby itselfis never aprimary,root cause of eithergreatnessor\ndecline.\nTheFlywheeland the DoomLoop. Those who launchrevolutions,dra\nmatic change programs, and wrenching restructuringswill almost cer\ntainlyfail to makethe leap from good to great. No matter howdramatic\nthe end result, the good-to-greattransformationsnever happened in one\nfell swoop. There was no single definingaction, no grand program, no\none killer innovation, no solitary lucky break, no miracle moment.\nRather,the processresembledrelentlesslypushinga giantheavyflywheel\nin one direction, turn upon turn, building momentum until a point of\nbreakthrough,and beyond.\nFrom Good to Great to Built to Last In an ironic twist, I now see Good to\nGreat not as a sequelto Builtto Last, but as more ofa prequel.Thisbook is\nabouthow toturna goodorganizationintoonethat producessustainedgreat\nresults.Builtto Last isabout how you take a companywith greatresultsand\nturn itinto an enduringgreatcompanyoficonicstature.To make thatfinal\nshift requirescore values and a purpose beyond just making money com\nbinedwith the key dynamicofpreservethe core/ stimulateprogress.\nGood to Sustained Builtto Enduring\nGreat -> Great f Last -> Great\nConcepts Results Concepts Company\nIf you arealreadya studentof Built to Last, pleaseset aside your ques\ntions aboutthe preciselinksbetweenthe two studiesasyou embarkupon\nthe findingsin Good to Great. In thelastchapter,I returnto this question\nand link the twostudiestogether.\nTHE TIMELESS \"PHYSICS\" OF GOOD TO GREAT\nI had just finishedpresentingmy researchto a set of Internetexecutives\ngatheredat aconference,when a hand shot up. \"Will your findingscon\ntinue toapply in the new economy?Don't we need tothrow out all the\noldideasandstartfrom scratch?\"It'sa legitimatequestion,aswedo live in\na time of dramaticchange,and it comes up so often that I'd like to dis\npensewith it rightup front, beforeheadingintothe meatofthe book."

He probablywould have liked it thatway.\nA man who carried no airs of self-importance,Smith found his favorite\ncompanionshipamongplumbersand electriciansand spent hisvacations\nrumbling around his Wisconsinfarm in the cab of a backhoe, digging\nholes and moving rocks.3 He never cultivatedhero status or executive\ncelebritystatus.4When a journalistasked him to describe his manage\nment style, Smith, dressedunfashionablylike afarm boywearinghis first\nsuit bought at J. C. Penney, just stared back from the other side of his\nnerdy-lookingblack-rimmedglasses.After a long,uncomfortablesilence,\nhe said simply: \"Eccentric.\"5The Wall Street Journal did not write a\nsplashyfeatureon DarwinSmith.\nBut ifyouwere to think ofDarwinSmithas somehowmeek orsoft,you\nwould be terriblymistaken.His awkwardshynessand lack of pretensewas\ncoupled with afierce, even stoic, resolvetoward life. Smith grew up as a\npoor Indianafarm-townboy, puttinghimselfthrough collegeby working\nthe day shiftat InternationalHarvesterand attendingIndiana University\nat night.One day, he lostpartofa fingeron thejob. The storygoes that he\nwent toclass that eveningand returnedto work the next day. While that\nmight be a bit of anexaggeration,he clearlydid not let a lostfingerslow\ndown his progresstoward graduation.He keptworkingfull-time,he kept\ngoingtoclass at night,and he earnedadmissiontoHarvardLaw School.6\nLater in life,two months after becomingCEO, doctorsdiagnosedSmith\nwith nose and throat cancer,predictinghe had less than a yearto live. He\ninformedthe board but made it clear that hewas not dead yet and had no\nplansto dieanytimesoon. Smithheld fullyto his demandingwork sched\nule while commuting weekly from Wisconsinto Houston for radiation\ntherapyandlivedtwenty-fivemore years,most ofthem as CEO.7\nSmith brought that same ferocious resolve to rebuilding Kimberly-\nClark, especiallywhen he made themost dramaticdecisionin the com\npany's history: Sell the mills.8 Shortlyafter he became CEO, Smith and\nhis team had concluded that the traditional core business—coated\npaper—wasdoomedto mediocrity.Its economicswere bad and the com\npetitionweak.9 But, theyreasoned,ifKimberly-Clarkthrustitselfinto the\n\f\n$40\n$30\n$20\n$10\n1951\n$40\n1971\nGood to Great 19\nBefore Darwin Smith\nKimberly-Clark, Cumulative Value of $1 Invested,\n1951 -1971\nDarwin Smith Tenure\nKimberly-Clark, Cumulative Value of $1 Invested,\n1971 -1991\nGeneral Market:\n$8.30\nKimberly-Clark:\n$5.30\n1971\nKimberly-Clark:\n$39.87\nGeneral Market:\n$9.81\n1991\n\f\n20 Jim Collins\nLEV|I^^^^^TIVEBuilgl|l^^^%j^ta^lthroughaparadoxical\nb\\eW0f^^M0i^k^l\\\\y and professional\nLevel 5 Hierarchy\nfire of theconsumerpaper-productsindustry,world-classcompetitionlike\nProcter& Gamble wouldforce it toachievegreatnessor perish.\nSo, like the generalwho burned the boats upon landing,leavingonly\none option (succeed or die), Smith announced the decision to sell the\nmills, in whatone board membercalledthe gutsiestmove he'd ever seen\na CEO make. Sell even the mill in Kimberly,Wisconsin,and throw all\nthe proceedsinto the consumerbusiness,investingin brandslike Huggies\nand Kleenex.10\nThe business media called the move stupid and Wall Street analysts\ndowngraded the stock.11 Smith never wavered. Twenty-fiveyears later,\nKimberly-Clarkowned Scott Paper outrightand beat Procter & Gamble\nin six of eightproductcategories.12In retirement,Smith reflectedon his\nexceptional performance, saying simply, \"I never stopped trying to\nbecome qualifiedfor the job.\"13\n\f\nGood to Great 21\nNOT WHAT WE EXPECTED\nDarwin Smith stands as aclassicexampleof what we came to call a Level\n5 leader—an individual who blends extreme personal humility with\nintense professionalwill. We found leaders of this type at the helm of\nevery good-to-greatcompany during the transition era.

So,\nwhat'sdifferent?\"Back and forth the debateraged.\nFinally—asshould alwaysbe the case—thedata won.\nThe good-to-greatexecutiveswere all cutfrom the same cloth. It didn't\nmatter whether the company was consumer or industrial, in crisis or\nsteadystate, offeredservicesor products.It didn't matter when the transi\ntion took place or howbig thecompany.All the good-to-greatcompanies\nhad Level 5 leadershipat the time oftransition.Furthermore, the absence\nofLevel 5leadershipshowedup asa consistentpatternin the comparison\ncompanies.Given that Level 5 leadershipcuts againstthe grain of con\nventionalwisdom, especiallythe beliefthat we need larger-than-lifesav\niors with bigpersonalitiesto transformcompanies,it is importantto note\nthat Level 5 isan empiricalfinding,not an ideologicalone.\nHUMILITY + WILL = LEVEL 5\nLevel 5 leaders are a study in duality: modest and willful, humble and\nfearless. To quicklygrasp this concept, think of United States President\nAbrahamLincoln (one of the few Level 5 presidentsin United Stateshis\ntory),who never let his ego get in theway of his primaryambition for the\nlarger cause of an enduring great nation.Yet those whomistookMr. Lin\ncoln's personal modesty, shy nature, and awkward manner as signs of\nweaknessfound themselvesterriblymistaken,to the scale of 250,000Con\nfederateand 360,000Unionlives, includingLincoln'sown.14\n\f\nGood to Great 23\nWhile it might be a bit ofastretchto comparethe good-to-greatCEOs\nto AbrahamLincoln, they diddisplaythe sameduality.Consider the case\nof Colman Mockler, CEO of Gillette from 1975 to 1991. During Mock-\nler's tenure, Gillette faced three attacks that threatened to destroy the\ncompany'sopportunityforgreatness.Twoattackscame ashostiletakeover\nbids fromRevlon,led by Ronald Perelman,a cigar-chompingraider with\na reputationfor breakingapart companiesto pay down junk bonds and\nfinance more hostile raids.15 The third attack came from Coniston Part\nners, an investmentgroup that bought 5.9 percent of Gillettestock and\ninitiated a proxy battle to seize control of the board, hoping to sell the\ncompanyto thehighestbidderand pocketa quick gain on theirshares.16\nHad Gillette beenflippedto Perelmanat the price he offered,shareown-\ners would have reapedan instantaneous44 percentgain on theirstock.17\nLookingat a$2.3 billionshort-termstockprofitacross 116 millionshares,\nmost executiveswould have capitulated, pocketing millions from flipping\ntheir own stockand cashingin ongenerousgoldenparachutes.18\nColman Mockler did not capitulate, choosing instead to fight for the\nfuture greatnessof Gillette,eventhough he himselfwouldhave pocketed\na substantial sum on his own shares.

With Sensor in mind, the board and Mockler\nbelieved that the future value of the shares far exceeded thecurrent price,"

To sell out would\nhave made short-termshareflippershappy but would have been utterly\nirresponsibleto long-termshareholders.\nIn theend, Mocklerandthe boardwere provedright,stunninglyso. Ifa\nshareflipperhad accepted the 44 percent price premium offered by\nRonald Perelman on October 31,1986, and then invested the full amount\nin the general market for ten years, through the end of 1996, he would\nhave come out threetimes worse offthan a shareholderwho had stayed\nwith Mocklerand Gillette.20Indeed,the company,its customers,and the\nshareholderswould have been illserved had Mocklercapitulatedto the\nraiders,pocketed his millions,and retired to a life of leisure.\nSadly, Mocklerwas neverable to enjoy the full fruits of his effort. On\nJanuary25, 1991,the Gilletteteamreceivedan advancecopyofthe cover\nof Forbes magazine, which featured anartist'srendition of Mockler stand\ning atop amountainholdinga giantrazor above his head in atriumphal\npose, while the vanquished languish on the hillsidesbelow. The other\n\f\nGood to Great 25\nexecutives razzed the publicity-shyMockler, who had likely declined\nrequeststo be photographedforthe coverin the first place, amused at see\ning him portrayedas a corporateversionof Conan the Triumphant. Walk\ning back to hisoffice,minutes afterseeingthis public acknowledgmentof\nhis sixteenyearsofstruggle,Mocklercrumpled to the floor,struckdead by\na massive heart attack.21\nI do not know whether Mockler would have chosen to die in harness,\nbut I am quite confident that he would not have changed his approach as\nchief executive.His placid persona hid an inner intensity,a dedication to\nmaking anything he touched the best it could possibly be—not just\nbecause of what he would get, but because he simply couldn't imagine\ndoing it any other way. It wouldn't have been an option within Colman\nMockler'svalue systemto takethe easy path and turn the company overto\nthose who would milk it like a cow, destroyingits potential to become\ngreat, any more than it would have been an option for Lincoln to sue for\npeace and loseforeverthe chance ofan enduring great nation.\nAmbition for the Company: Setting Up Successors\nfor Success\nWhen David Maxwellbecame CEO of Fannie Mae in 1981,the company\nwas losing$1 million every single businessday. Overthe next nine years,\nMaxwell transformedFannie Mae into a high-performanceculture that\nrivaled the best Wall Street firms, earning $4 millionevery businessday\nand beatingthe generalstockmarket3.8to 1. Maxwellretiredwhile stillat\nthe top of his game, feeling that the company would be ill served if he\nstayedon too long,and turned the companyoverto an equallycapablesuc\ncessor, Jim Johnson. Shortly thereafter, Maxwell's retirement package,\nwhichhad grown to beworth $20millionbased on Fannie Mae'sspectac\nularperformance,becamea pointof controversyin Congress(FannieMae\noperatesunder a governmentcharter).Maxwellrespondedbywritinga let\nter to his successor, in which he expressedconcern that the controversy\nwouldtriggeran adversereactionin Washingtonthat could jeopardizethe\nfuture of the company. He then instructedJohnson not to pay him the\nremaining balance—$5.5million—andasked that the entire amount be\ncontributedto theFannieMaefoundationfor low-incomehousing.22\nDavidMaxwell,like DarwinSmithand Colman Mockler,exemplifieda\nkey trait of Level 5 leaders: ambition first and foremostfor the company\nand concern for its successrather than for one's own riches and personal\n\f\n26 Jim Collins\nrenown.Level 5 leaderswantto see thecompanyeven moresuccessfulin\nthe nextgeneration,comfortablewith the ideathat mostpeoplewon'teven\nknow that the roots of that success trace back to their efforts. As one Level 5\nleadersaid, \"I want to look out from my porch at one ofthe greatcompa\nnies in theworldsomedayand be ableto say, 1 usedto work there.' \"\nIn contrast, the comparisonleaders, concerned more with their own\nreputation for personalgreatness,often failed to set the company up for\nsuccessin the nextgeneration.Afterall,whatbettertestamentto yourown\npersonalgreatnessthan that the placefalls apartafteryou leave?\nSome had the\"biggestdog\" syndrome—theydidn't mind other dogs in\nthe kennel, as long as they remained the biggestone. One comparison\nCEO was said to have treated successorcandidates\"the way Henry the\nVIII treated wives.\"23\nConsider the case of Rubbermaid,an unsustained comparison com\npany that grew fromobscurityto number one on Fortune'sannual list of\nAmerica'sMost Admired Companies and then, just as quickly, disinte\ngrated into suchsorryshapethat it had to be acquired byNewell to save\nitself.The architect of this remarkable story, a charismatic and brilliant\nleader named Stanley Gault, becamesynonymousin the late 1980swith\nthe success of the company. In 312 articles collected on Rubbermaid,\nGault comes through as a hard-driving,egocentric executive. In one\narticle, he responds to the accusation of being a tyrant with the state\nment, \"Yes, but I'm a sincere tyrant.\"24In another, drawn directlyfrom\nhis owncommentson leadingchange,the wordI appearsforty-fourtimes\n(\"I could lead the charge\"; \"I wrote the twelve objectives\";\"I presented\nand explained the objectives\"),whereasthe word we appears just sixteen\ntimes.25 Gault had every reason to be proud of his executive success.\nRubbermaid generated forty consecutive quarters of earnings growth\nunder his leadership—an impressiveperformance, and one that deserves\nrespect.\nBut—and this is the keypoint—Gaultdid not leavebehind a company\nthat would be great without him. His chosen successor lasted only one\n\f\nGood to Great 27\nyearon the job and the nextin line faced a managementteam so shallow\nthat he had totemporarilyshoulderfour jobs whilescramblingto identify\na new numbertwo executive.26Gault'ssuccessorsfound themselvesstrug\ngling not only with a managementvoid, but also with strategicvoids that\nwould eventuallybringthe companyto its knees.27\nOf course,you mightsay, \"Yes, Rubbermaidfell apart after Gault, but\nthat just proves his personal greatnessas a leader.\" Exactly! Gault was\nindeed a tremendous Level 4 leader, perhaps one of the best in the last\nfifty years. But he was not aLevel 5 leader,and that is onekey reasonwhy\nRubbermaid went from good to great for a brief shining moment and\nthen, justas quickly,went from greatto irrelevant.\nA Compelling Modesty\nIn contrast to the very/-centric style of the comparison leaders, we were\nstruckby how thegood-to-greatleadersdidnt talkabout themselves.Dur\ning interviewswith the good-to-greatleaders,they'd talk about the com\npany and the contributions of other executivesas long as we'd like but\nwould deflect discussionabout their own contributions. When pressed to\ntalkabout themselves,they'dsay thingslike,\"I hope I'm not soundinglike\na big shot.\" Or, \"If the board hadn't picked such great successors,you\nprobablywouldn't be talkingwith me today.\"Or, \"Did I have a lot to do\nwith it? Oh, that sounds so self-serving.I don't think I can take much\ncredit. We wereblessedwith marvelouspeople.\"Or, \"There are plenty of\npeople in this companywho could do my jobbetter than I do.\"\nIt wasn't justfalse modesty.Those whoworkedwith or wroteabout the\ngood-to-greatleaders continually used words like quiet, humble, modest,\nreserved, shy, gracious, mild-mannered,self-effacing,understated,did not\nbelieve his own clippings; and so forth. Board member Jim Hlavacek\ndescribed Ken Iverson, the CEO who oversaw Nucor's transformation\nfrom near bankruptcyto one ofthe mostsuccessfulsteel companies in the\nworld:\nKen isa verymodest and humble man. I'veneverknown a person assuc\ncessfulin doing what he's done that's asmodest.And, Iwork for a lot of\nCEOs of large companies.And that's true in hisprivatelife as well.The\nsimplicityof him. I mean little thingslike he alwaysgets hisdogs at the\nlocal pound. He has a simple house that's he's lived in for ages. He only\nhas a carport and he complained to me one dayabout how he had to use"

George\nCain, Alan Wurtzel, David Maxwell, Colman Mockler, Darwin Smith,\nJim Herring,Lyle Everingham,Joe Cullman,FredAllen,CorkWalgreen,\nCarl Reichardt—howmany of these extraordinaryexecutives had you\nheard of?\nThe good-to-greatleaders never wanted to become larger-than-life\nheroes. They never aspiredto be put on a pedestalor become unreach\nable icons.Theywere seeminglyordinarypeoplequietlyproducingextra\nordinary results.\nSomeofthe comparisonleadersprovidea strikingcontrast.ScottPaper,\nthe comparison company to Kimberly-Clark,hired a CEO named Al\nDunlap, a man cut from a very differentcloth than Darwin Smith. Dun-\nlap loudly beat on his ownchest, telling anyone who would listen (and\nmanywho wouldprefernot to) aboutwhathe hadaccomplished.Quoted\nin BusinessWeek about his nineteenmonthsatop ScottPaper,he boasted,\n\"The Scottstory will go down in theannalsofAmericanbusinesshistory\nas one of themost successful,quickestturnaroundsever, [making] other\nturnaroundspale by comparison.\"30\nAccordingto BusinessWeek, Dunlap personallyaccrued $100 million\nfor 603 days of work at Scott Paper (that's $165,000per day), largelyby\nslashingthe workforce,cuttingthe R&D budgetin half, and puttingthe\ncompanyon growthsteroidsin preparationfor sale.31 Aftersellingoffthe\n\f\nGood to Great 29\ncompanyand pocketinghis quickmillions,Dunlap wrote a book about\nhimself, in which he trumpeted his nickname Rambo in Pinstripes. \"I\nlove the Rambo movies,\"he wrote. \"Here's a guywho has zero chance of\nsuccess and always wins. Rambo goes into situations against all odds,\nexpectingtogethis brainsblownout. Buthe doesn't.Atthe end oftheday\nhe succeeds, he gets rid of the bad guys. He creates peace out of war.\nThat's what I do, too.\"32 Darwin Smith may have enjoyed the mindless\nRambo moviesas well, but I suspecthe neverwalkedout of a theater and\nsaid to his wife, \"You know, I really relate to this Rambo character; he\nreminds me of me.\"\nGranteSithe §e<?tt^p^r.istQfy^Xspne.olth^^ofadmmaticjp, pur\nstudy, birt its not arv isolatedcase. In over twothirdsof the compari-\nrtpersonal ego that\n^^bmpan^\nWe found this pattern particularlystrong in the unsustained compar\nisons—cases where the company would show a leap in performance\nunder a talented yet egocentric leader, only to decline in lateryears. Lee\nIacocca, for example, saved Chrysler from the brink of catastrophe, per\nforming one of the most celebrated (and deservedlyso) turnarounds in\nAmerican businesshistory.Chryslerrose to a height of 2.9 times the mar\nket at a point about halfway through his tenure. Then, however, he\ndivertedhis attention to makinghimselfone ofthe mostcelebrated CEOs\nin American businesshistory.InvestorsBusinessDaily and the WallStreet\nJournalchronicled how Iacocca appearedregularlyon talk shows like the\nToday show and Larry King Live, personallystarred in over eighty com\nmercials, entertained the idea of running for president of the United\nStates(quoted at one point, \"RunningChryslerhas been a biggerjob than\nrunning the country. ... I could handle the national economy in six\nmonths\"), and widely promoted his autobiography. The book, Iacocca,\nsoldsevenmillion copiesand elevatedhim to rockstarstatus,leading him\nto be mobbed by thousandsof cheeringfans upon his arrival in Japan.34\nIacocca's personal stock soared, but in the second half of his tenure,\nChrysler'sstockfell 31 percent behind the general market.\nSadly, Iacocca had trouble leaving center stage and letting go of the\nperks of executive kingship. He postponed his retirement so many times\n\f\n30 Jim Collins\nthat insidersat Chryslerbeganto joke that Iacoccastoodfor\"I AmChair\nmanofChryslerCorporationAlways.\"35And when he didfinallyretire,he\ndemanded that the board continue to provide a private jet and stock\noptions.36Later,he joinedforceswith notedtakeoverartistKirk Kerkorian\nto launch ahostiletakeoverbidfor Chrysler.37\nChrysler experienceda brief return to glory in the five years after\nIacocca'sretirement,but the company'sunderlyingweaknesseseventu\nally led to abuyoutby GermancarmakerDaimler-Benz.38Certainly,the\ndemise of Chrysleras a stand-alonecompany does not rest entirelyon\nIacocca'sshoulders(the nextgenerationofmanagementmadethe fateful\ndecision to sell the company to the Germans), but the fact remains:\nIacocca'sbrilliantturnaroundin the early 1980s did not prove to be sus\ntainedand Chryslerfailed tobecomean enduringgreatcompany.\nUnwavering Resolve ... to Do What Must Be Done\nIt is very important to grasp that Level 5 leadership is not just about\nhumility and modesty. It is equally about ferocious resolve, an almost\nstoic determination to do whatever needs to be done to make the com\npany great.\nIndeed, we debatedfor a long time on theresearchteam about how to\ndescribe the good-to-greatleaders. Initially, we penciled in terms like\n\"selfless executive\" and \"servant leader.\" But members of the team vio\nlently objected to thesecharacterizations.\n\"Those labels don't ring true,\" saidAnthonyChirikos. \"It makes them\nsound weak or meek,but that's not at all theway I think of Darwin Smith\nor Colman Mockler.They would do almostanythingto make the com\npany great.\"\nThen Eve Li suggested,\"Whydon't we justcall them Level 5 leaders?\nIfwe put a label like'selfless'or 'servant'on them, peoplewill get entirely\nthe wrongidea. We need to get people to engagewith the whole concept,\nto seeboth sidesofthe coin. Ifyouonlygetthe humilityside,you miss the\nwhole idea.\"\nLevel 5 leadersare fanaticallydriven, infectedwith an incurable need\nto produce results. They will sell the mills or fire their brother, if that's\nwhat ittakes to makethe companygreat.\nWhen George Cain became CEO of Abbott Laboratories,it sat in the\nbottom quartile of thepharmaceuticalindustry,a drowsy enterprisethat\n\f\nGood to Great 31\nhad lived for years off its cash cow, erythromycin.Cain didn't have an\ninspiringpersonalityto galvanize the company, but he had something\nmuch more powerful:inspiredstandards.He could not standmediocrity\nin any form and was utterly intolerantof anyone who would accept the\nidea thatgood isgood enough.Cain then setouttodestroyone ofthe key\ncauses of Abbott's mediocrity:nepotism. Systematicallyrebuilding both\nthe board and theexecutiveteam withthe bestpeople he could find, Cain\nmade it clear that neitherfamilytiesnor length oftenure would have any\nthing to dowith whetheryou held a key positionin the company.If you\ndidn't have the capacityto become the bestexecutivein the industryin\nyourspan ofresponsibility,thenyou would lose your paycheck.39\nSuch rigorous rebuilding might be expected from an outsider\nbrought in to turn thecompanyaround, but Cainwas an eighteen-year\nveteran insider anda family member, the son of a previousAbbott pres\nident. Holiday gatherings were probablytense for a few years in the\nCain clan. (\"Sorry I had to fire you. Want another slice of turkey?\") In\nthe end, though, family members were quite pleased with the perfor\nmance of their stock, for Cain set in motion a profitable growth\nmachine that, from its transition date in 1974 to 2000, created share\nholder returns that beat the market4.5 to 1,handilyoutperformingindus\ntry superstarsMerck and Pfizer.\nUpjohn, the direct comparison company to Abbott, also had family\nleadership during the same era as George Cain. Unlike George Cain,\nUpjohn'sCEO nevershowedthe same resolveto breakthe mediocrityof\nnepotism.By the timeAbbotthad filledallkey seats with the bestpeople,\nregardlessoffamilybackground,Upjohnstill had Blevelfamilymembers\nholdingkey positions.40Virtuallyidenticalcompanieswith identicalstock\ncharts up to the point oftransition,Upjohn then fell 89 percent behind\nAbbott over the nexttwenty-oneyears before capitulating in a merger to\nPharmacia in 1995.\nAs an interestingaside, Darwin Smith, Colman Mockler,and George\nCain came from inside the company.StanleyGault, Al Dunlap, and Lee\nIacocca rode in assaviorsfrom the outside,trumpets blaring. Thisreflects\na more systematicfindingfrom our study. The evidencedoes not support\nthe idea that you need an outside leader to come in and shake up the\nplace to go from good to great. In fact, going for a high-profileoutside\nchange agent isnegativelycorrelatedwith a sustainedtransformationfrom\ngood to great. (See Appendix2.A.)\n\f\n32 Jim Collins\nA superb example of insider-drivenchange comes from Charles R.\n\"Cork\"Walgreen3d, who transformeddowdyWalgreensinto a company\nthat outperformedthe stock marketbyover fifteen times from the end of\n1975 to January 1, 2000.42 After years ofdialogueand debate within his\nexecutive team about Walgreens' food-serviceoperations,Cork sensed\nthat the team had finallyreacheda watershedpointofclarityand under\nstanding: Walgreens'brightestfuture lay in convenientdrugstores,not\nfood service. Dan Jorndt, who succeededWalgreen as CEO in 1998,\ndescribedwhathappened next:\nCorksaid atone ofourplanningcommitteemeetings,\"Okay,now I am\ngoingto draw the line in thesand. We aregoingto be out oftherestau\nrant business completelyin five years.\" At the time, we had over five\nhundredrestaurants.You could have heard a pindrop. He said, \"I want\ntolet everybodyknowtheclockis ticking \" Six monthslater,we were\nat our next planningcommitteemeetingand someone mentionedjust\nin passingthatwe onlyhadfive yearsto be out oftherestaurantbusiness.\nCorkwas nota real vociferousfellow. Hesortoftappedon thetableand\nsaid, \"Listen,you have four and a halfyears. I said you had five years six\nmonthsago. Now you'vegot four and a halfyears.\"Well, that next day,\nthings reallyclickedinto gear to windingdown our restaurantbusiness.\nHe neverwavered.He neverdoubted;he neversecond-guessed.43\nLike Darwin Smith selling the mills at Kimberly-Clark,Cork Wal-\ngreen's decision required stoic resolve. Not that food service was the\nlargestpart ofthe business(althoughit did add substantialprofits to the\nbottomline).Thereal problemwas more emotional.Walgreenshad, after\nall, inventedthe malted milkshakeand food servicewas a long-standing\nfamilytraditiondatingback to hisgrandfather.Some food-serviceoutlets\nwere even named after the CEO himself—a restaurant chain named\nCorky's.But nomatter,ifWalgreenshad to fly inthe face oflong-standing\nfamilytradition in order to focus itsresourceswhere it could be the best in\n\f\nGood to Great 33\nthe world (convenient drugstores),Cork would do it. Quietly, doggedly,\nsimply.44\nThe quiet, dogged nature of Level 5 leaders showed up not only in big\ndecisions, like selling off the food-serviceoperations or fighting corpo\nrate raiders, but also in a personalstyle of sheerworkmanlikediligence.\nAlan Wurtzel, a second-generation family member who took over his\nfamily's small company and turned it into Circuit City, perfectly cap\ntured the gestalt of this trait. When asked about differences between\nhimself and his counterpart CEO at Circuit City's comparison company,\nWurtzel summed up: \"The showhorseand the plowhorse—he was more\nofa show horse,whereasI was more ofa plow horse.\"45\nThe Window and the Mirror\nAlan Wurtzel's plow horse comment is fascinatingin light of two other\nfacts. First,he holds a doctorof jurisprudencedegreefromYale—clearly,\nhis plow horse nature had nothing to do with a lack ofintelligence. Sec\nond, his plowhorse approachsetthe stagefortruly bestinshow results.Let\nme put it this way: If you had tochoose between $1 investedin Circuit\nCityor $1 investedin GeneralElectricon theday that thelegendaryJack\nWelch took overGE in 1981 and held to January 1, 2000,you would have\nbeen betteroffwith CircuitCity—bysix times.46Nota bad performance,\nfor a plow horse.\nYou might expect that extraordinaryresultslike these would lead Alan\nWurtzel to discuss the brilliant decisions he made. But when we asked\nhim to list the top five factors in his company'stransformation,ranked by\nimportance, Wurtzel gave a surprising answer: The number one factor\nwas luck. \"We were in a greatindustry,with the wind at our backs.\"\nWe pushed back, pointing out that we selected thegood-to-greatcom\npanies based on performance thatsurpassedtheir industry'saverage.Fur\nthermore, the comparison company(Silo) was in the same industry,with\nthe same wind and probablybigger sails! We debated the point for a few\nminutes, with Wurtzel continuing his preference for attributing much of\nhis successto just being in the right place at the right time. Later, when\naskedto discussthe factorsbehind the enduring nature of thetransforma\ntion, he said,\"The firstthing that comesto mind isluck.... I was luckyto\nfind the rightsuccessor.\"47\nLuck. What an odd factor to talk about. Yet the good-to-greatexecu\ntives talked a lot about luck in our interviews. In one interview with a\n\f\n34 Jim Collins\nNucor executive,we asked why the company had such a remarkable\ntrack record of good decisions; he responded: \"I guess we were just\nlucky.\"48Joseph F. Cullman 3d, the Level 5 transitionCEO of Philip\nMorris,flat-outrefusedto take creditfor his company'ssuccess,attribut\ninghis good fortuneto havinggreatcolleagues,successors,and predeces\nsors.49Even thebook he wrote—abook he undertookat theurgingofhis\ncolleagues, which he never intended to distribute widely outside the\ncompany—hadthe unusual title Ym a Lucky Guy. The opening para\ngraph reads: \"I was a very lucky guy from the very beginningof mylife:\nmarvelous parents, good genes, lucky in love, lucky in business, and\nlucky when aYale classmatehad myorders changedto report toWash\nington, D.C., in early 1941, instead of to a ship that was sunk with all\nhandslostin the NorthAtlantic,luckyto be in theNavy, and luckyto be\nalive at eighty-five.\"50\nWe were at first puzzledby this emphasison good luck. After all, we\nfound no evidence that the good-to-greatcompanies were blessed with\nmore good luck (or more badluck, for that matter)than the comparison\ncompanies.Then we beganto noticea contrastingpatternin thecompar\nison executives:They creditedsubstantialblame to bad luck, frequendy\nbemoaningthe difficultiesofthe environmenttheyfaced.\nCompare Bethlehem Steel to Nucor. Bothcompaniesoperated in the\nsteel industryand produced hard-to-differentiateproducts.Both compa\nnies faced the competitivechallengeof cheapimportedsteel.Yet execu\ntives at the two companies had completelydifferentviews of the same\nenvironment.BethlehemSteel'sCEO summed up the company'sprob\nlems in 1983 byblamingimports:\"Our first, second,and third problems\nare imports.\"51Ken Iverson and his crew at Nucor consideredthe same\nchallengefrom imports a blessing, a stroke of good fortune (\"Aren'twe\nlucky;steel isheavy,and theyhave to shipit all theway acrossthe ocean,\ngiving us a huge advantage!\").Iverson saw the first, second, and third\nproblemsfacing the Americansteel industrynot to be imports,but man\nagement.52He even went so far as to speak out publiclyagainstgovern\nment protectionagainst imports, telling a stunned gathering of fellow\nsteel executivesin 1977 that thereal problemsfacing the Americansteel\nindustry lay in the fact that management had failed to keep pace with\ninnovation.53\nThe emphasison luck turns out to be part of a pattern that we came to\ncall the window and the mirror."

No, theyfirst got the right people on the bus (and the wrong people\noffthe bus) and then figured out where todrive it. They said, inessence,\n\"Look,I don't reallyknowwhere we should take this bus. But I know this\nmuch: If we get the right people on the bus, the right people in the right\nseats,and the wrong people offthe bus, then well figure out how to take it\nsomeplace great.\"\n\f\n42 Jim Collins\nThe good-to-greatleaders understoodthree simple truths. First, if you\nbegin with \"who,\" rather than \"what,\" you can more easily adapt to a\nchanging world. If people join the bus primarilybecause of where it is\ngoing, what happensifyou getten miles down the road and you need to\nchange direction?You've got a problem. But if people are on the bus\nbecauseofwho else is on thebus, then it's much easierto changedirec\ntion: \"Hey, I got on this bus because of who else is on it; if we need to\nchange directionto be more successful,fine with me.\" Second, if you\nhave the right people on the bus, the problem of how to motivate and\nmanage people largely goes away. The right people don't need to be\ntightlymanagedor fired up; they will be self-motivatedbythe inner drive\nto produce the best results and to be part of creatingsomethinggreat.\nThird, if you have the wrong people, it doesn'tmatter whetheryou dis\ncover the right direction;you still won't have a great company. Great\nvisionwithoutgreatpeopleis irrelevant.\nConsider the case of Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo began its fifteen-year\nstint of spectacular performance in 1983,but the foundation for the shift\ndates backto theearly 1970s,when then-CEODick Cooleybeganbuild\ning one of themost talentedmanagementteams in the industry(the best\nteam, according to investor Warren Buffett).2 Cooley foresaw that the\nbanking industrywould eventuallyundergo wrenchingchange, but he\ndid not pretendto know whatform that changewould take. So insteadof\nmapping out a strategy for change, he and chairman Ernie Arbuckle\nfocusedon \"injectingan endlessstreamoftalent\"directlyinto theveinsof\nthe company. They hired outstandingpeople whenever and wherever\ntheyfound them,oftenwithoutany specificjob in mind. \"That'show you\nbuildthe future,\"he said. \"IfI'm notsmartenoughtoseethe changesthat\nare coming,theywill. And they'llbe flexibleenoughto dealwith them.\"3\nCooley'sapproachprovedprescient.No one couldpredictall thechanges\nthat would be wroughtbybankingderegulation.Yet when these changes\ncame,no bankhandledthosechallengesbetterthan Wells Fargo.Ata time\nwhen itssectorofthe bankingindustryfell 59percentbehind the general\nstockmarket,Wells Fargooutperformedthe marketbyoverthree times.4\nCarl Reichardt, who became CEO in 1983, attributed the bank's suc\ncess largelyto the people around him, most of whom he inherited from\nCooley.5As he listedmembersoftheWells Fargoexecutiveteam thathad\njoined the company during the Cooley-Reichardtera, we were stunned.\nNearly every person had gone on tobecome CEO of a major company:"

While Dick Cooley\nsystematicallyrecruited the bestpeoplehe could get his hands on, Bankof\nAmerica, according to the book Breaking the Bank, followed something\ncalled the \"weak generals,stronglieutenants\"model.8 If you pickstrong\ngenerals for key positions, their competitors will leave. But if you pick\nweak generals—placeholders,rather than highly capable executives—\nthen the stronglieutenants are more likelyto stickaround.\nThe weakgenerals model produced a climate very different at Bank of\nAmericathan the one atWells Fargo.Whereasthe Wells Fargocrewacted\nas a strongteam of equalpartners,ferociouslydebating eyeball-to-eyeball\nin search of the bestanswers,the Bank ofAmericaweak generalswould\nwait for directions from above. Sam Armacost, who inherited the weak\ngeneralsmodel, describedthe management climate: \"I came away quite\ndistressed from my first couple of management meetings.

In fact, Bank of America recruited so many Wells\nFargo executivesduring its turnaround that people inside began to referto\nthemselvesas \"WellsofAmerica.\"11At thatpoint,BankofAmericabeganto\nclimb upwardagain,but it was too littletoo late.

What's new about that?\" On one\nlevel, we have to agree; it is just plain old-fashionedgood management.\nButwhat standsout with suchdistinctionin the good-to-greatcompanies\nare two key pointsthat made them quitedifferent.\n\"First who\" is a very simple idea to grasp, and a very difficult idea to\ndo—and most don't do it well. It's easy to talk about payingattention to\n\f\nGood to Great 45\npeople decisions,but how manyexecutiveshave the disciplineof David\nMaxwell,who heldoffon developinga strategyuntil he gotthe rightpeo\nple inplace,while the companywas losing$1 millioneverysinglebusiness\nday with $56 billion of loansunderwater?When Maxwell became CEO\nof Fannie Mae during its darkest days, the board desperatelywanted to\nknow how he was going to rescue the company. Despite the immense\npressureto act, to dosomethingdramatic,to seizethe wheel and startdri\nving, Maxwellfocusedfirston gettingthe rightpeopleon the Fannie Mae\nmanagement team. His first act was to interview all the officers. He sat\nthem down and said, \"Look, this is going to be avery hard challenge.I\nwant you to think abouthow demandingthis is going to be. Ifyou don't\nthinkyou'regoingto like it,that'sfine. Nobody'sgoingto hate you.\"12\nMaxwell made it absolutelyclear that therewould only be seats for A\nplayerswho were goingtoput forth anA+ effort,andif you weren'tupfor\nit, you had better get offthe bus, and get offnow.13 One executivewho\nhad justuprooted his lifeand career to join Fannie Mae came toMaxwell\nand said, \"I listenedto you very carefully,and I don't wantto dothis.\"He\nleft andwent back towhere he came from.14 In all, fourteenoftwenty-six\nexecutivesleft the company,replacedby some of the best, smartest,and\nhardest-workingexecutives in the entire world of finance.15 The same\nstandardappliedup and down theFannieMae ranks as managersatevery\nlevel increasedthe caliberoftheirteams and put immensepeer pressure\nupon each other, creatinghigh turnoverat first, when some people just\ndidn'tpanout.16\"We hada saying,*You can'tfake itat FannieMae,'\" said\none executiveteam member. \"Eitheryou knew your stuffor you didn't,\nand if you didn't, you'd justblowout ofhere.\"17\nWells Fargo and Fannie Mae both illustratethe idea that\"who\" ques\ntions come before\"what\"questions—beforevision,beforestrategy,before\ntactics, before organizationalstructure,before technology.Dick Cooley\nand David Maxwell both exemplifieda classic Level 5 style when they\nsaid,\"Idon't knowwherewe shouldtake this company,but I doknowthat\nif Istart with the right people,ask them the right questions,and engage\nthem invigorousdebate,we will find a way to make this companygreat.\"\nNOT A \"GENIUS WITH A THOUSAND HELPERS\"\nIn contrastto the good-to-greatcompanies,which built deep and strong\nexecutiveteams, many of the comparisoncompaniesfollowed a \"genius\n\f\n46 Jim Collins\nwith a thousandhelpers\"model. In this model, the companyis aplatform\nfor the talents of an extraordinaryindividual.In these cases, the towering\ngenius,the primarydrivingforce in thecompany'ssuccess,isa greatasset—\nas long as thegeniussticksaround.The geniusesseldombuild greatman\nagementteams, for the simple reason that they don't need one, andoften\ndon't want one. If you're a genius, you don't need a Wells Fargo-caliber\nmanagementteam ofpeople who could run their own shows elsewhere.\nNo, you justneed anarmy ofgood soldierswho can help implementyour\ngreatideas.However,when thegeniusleaves,the helpersareoftenlost. Or,\nworse,theytryto mimictheir predecessorwith bold,visionarymoves(trying\nto actlike a genius,withoutbeinga genius)thatprove unsuccessful.\nEckerd Corporation suffered the liability of a leader who had an\nuncannygeniusfor figuringout \"what\"to do butlittleabilityto assemble\nthe right \"who\" on the executiveteam. Jack Eckerd,blessedwith monu\nmental personal energy (he campaignedfor governor of Florida while\nrunning his company)and a genetic gift for market insightand shrewd\ndeal making, acquired his way from two little stores in Wilmington,\nDelaware,to a drugstoreempire of over a thousand stores spread across\nthe southeastern United States.

C. Penney.18\nThe contrast between Jack Eckerd and Cork Walgreen is striking.\nWhereas Jack Eckerd had a genius for picking the right stores to buy,\nCork Walgreen had a genius for picking the right people to hire.19\nWhereasJack Eckerdhad a giftforseeingwhichstoresshouldgo in what\nlocations,CorkWalgreenhad agiftfor seeingwhichpeopleshouldgo in\nwhat seats. Whereas Jack Eckerdfailed utterly at the single most impor\ntant decisionfacing any executive—theselectionof a successor—Cork\nWalgreen developed multiple outstandingcandidates and selected a\nsuperstarsuccessor,who may prove to be even better than Cork him\nself.20Whereas Jack Eckerd had no executiveteam, but instead a bunch\nof capable helpers assembledto assist the great genius, Cork Walgreen\nbuilt the best executiveteam in the industry.Whereas the primaryguid\nance mechanism for Eckerd Corporation'sstrategylay inside Jack Eck\nerd's head, the primary guidance mechanism for Walgreens'corporate\n\f\nLevel 5 +\nManagement Team\n(Good-to-Great Companies)\nLevel 5 Leader\n♦\nFirst Who\nGet the right people on the bus.\nBuilda superior executive team.\n*\nThen What\nOnce you have the right people\nin place, figure out the best path\nto greatness.\nGood to Great 47\nA \"Genius with a\nThousand Helpers\"\n(Comparison Companies)\nLevel 4 Leader\n\\\nFirst What\nSet a vision for where to drive\nthe bus.

Butonce you've structured\nsomethingthat makes basic sense, executivecompensationfalls away as a\ndistinguishingvariablein movingan organizationfrom good togreat.\n\f\n50 Jim Collins\nWhy might that be? It issimplya manifestationof the \"firstwho\" prin\nciple:It's nothow you compensateyourexecutives,it's which executivesyou\nhave to compensatein the first place. If you have the right executiveson\nthe bus, theywill do everythingwithin their power to build a great com\npany, not because of what theywill \"get\" for it, but because theysimply\ncannot imagine settling for anything less. Their moral code requires\nbuildingexcellencefor its own sake, and you'reno morelikelyto change\nthat witha compensationpackagethan you'relikelyto affectwhether they\nbreathe. The good-to-greatcompanies understood a simple truth: The\nright people will do the right things and deliver the best results they're\ncapableof, regardlessofthe incentivesystem.\nifSliP^?^ 3\nWe were not able to look asrigorouslyat nonexecutivecompensation;\nsuch data is notavailablein assystematica formatas proxystatementsfor\ntop officers. Nonetheless,evidencefrom source documentsand articles\nsuggeststhatthe same idea appliesatall levelsofan organization.27\nA particularlyvivid exampleis Nucor. Nucor built its entiresystem on\nthe ideathat you can teachfarmershow to make steel,but youcan't teach\na farmer work ethic to people who don't have it in the first place. So,\ninstead of setting up mills in traditionalsteel towns like Pittsburghand\nGary, it locatedits plants in placeslike Crawfordsville,Indiana;Norfolk,\nNebraska;and Plymouth,Utah—placesfull of realfarmerswho go to bed\nearly, rise at dawn, and get righttowork withoutfanfare.\"Gotta milk the\ncows\"and \"Gonnaplowthe northfortybeforenoon\"translatedeasilyinto\n\"Gotta roll some sheet steel\" and \"Gonna cast forty tons before lunch.\"\nNucor ejected people who did not share this work ethic, generating as\nhighas50 percentturnoverin thefirstyearofa plant,followedbyverylow\nturnoveras the rightpeoplesettledin for thelong haul.28\nTo attract and keep the bestworkers,Nucor paid its steelworkersmore\nthan any other steel company in the world. But it built its pay system\naround ahigh-pressureteam-bonusmechanism,withover 50percent ofa\n\f\nGood to Great 51\nworker'scompensationtieddirectlyto theproductivityofhis workteamof\ntwentyto forty people.29Nucorteam memberswould usuallyshow up for\nwork thirtyminutesearlyto arrangetheirtools and prepareto blastoffthe\nstartinglinethe instanttheshiftgunfired.30\"We have the hardestworking\nsteel workers in the world,\" said one Nucor executive. \"We hire five, work\nthemlike ten, andpay themlike eight.\"31\nThe Nucor system did not aim to turn lazy people into hard workers,\nbut to createan environmentwherehardworkingpeoplewould thriveand\nlazy workers would either jump or get thrown right off thebus. In one\nextremecase,workerschaseda lazy teammateright out of the plant with\nan angle iron.32\nNucor illustratesa key point. In determining \"the right people,\" the\ngood-to-greatcompanies placed greater weight on character attributes\nthan on specific educational background, practical skills, specialized\nknowledge,or work experience. Not that specificknowledgeor skills are\nunimportant, but they viewed these traits as more teachable (or at least\nlearnable), whereas they believed dimensions like character, work ethic,\nbasic intelligence, dedication to fulfillingcommitments, and values are\nmore ingrained.As Dave Nassefof PitneyBowes put it:\nI used to be in the Marines,and the Marinesget a lot of credit for build\ning people's values. But that's not the way it really works.

We want toknow: Who are they? Why are they?We find out who\nthey are by asking them why they made decisions in their life. The\nanswersto thesequestionsgive us insightintotheircore values.33\nOne good-to-great executive said that his best hiring decisions often\ncame from people with no industry or business experience. In one case,\n\f\n52 Jim Collins\nhe hired amanagerwho'd been capturedtwice duringthe SecondWorld\nWar and escapedboth times. \"I thought thatanyone who could do that\nshouldn't have trouble with business.\"34\nRIGOROUS, NOT RUTHLESS\nThe good-to-greatcompaniesprobablysoundlike tough placesto work—\nand they are. Ifyou don'thave what it takes,you probablywon'tlastlong.\nBut they're not ruthless cultures,they're rigorous cultures.And the dis\ntinction is crucial.\nTo be ruthlessmeans hackingand cutting,especiallyin difficulttimes,\norwantonlyfiringpeoplewithoutanythoughtfulconsideration.To be rig\norousmeansconsistentlyapplyingexactingstandardsat all timesand at all\nlevels, especiallyin upper management.To be rigorous, not ruthless,\nmeans that the best people need not worry about their positionsand can\nconcentrate fullyon their work.\nIn 1986,Wells Fargo acquiredCrockerBankand planned to shed gobs\nof excesscost in theconsolidation.There's nothing unusual aboutthat—\neverybank merger in the era ofderegulationaimed to cut excess cost out\nof a bloated and protectedindustry.However,what was unusual about the\nWells-Crockerconsolidationis theway Wells integratedmanagement or,\nto be more accurate,the way it didn't even try tointegratemost Crocker\nmanagementinto the Wellsculture.\nThe WellsFargoteam concludedrightup frontthat the vastmajorityof\nCrocker managerswouldbe the wrongpeopleon the bus. Crocker people\nhad long been steeped in the traditionsand perks of old-stylebanker cul\nture, complete with a marbled executivedining room with its own chef\nand $500,000worth of china.35Quite a contrastto the spartanculture at\nWellsFargo,wheremanagementate food preparedbya college dormitory\nfood service.36Wells Fargo made it clearto theCrockermanagers:\"Look,\nthis is not a mergerofequals;it'san acquisition;we bought your branches\nand yourcustomers;we didn't acquireyou/7 Wells Fargoterminated most\nofthe Crocker management team—1,600Crocker managersgone on day\none—includingnearlyall the topexecutives.37\nA critic mightsay, \"That's justthe Wells people protecting their own.\"\nBut consider the followingfact: Wells Fargo also sent some of its own\nmanagers packing in cases where the Crocker managers were judged as\nbetter qualified. When it came to management, the Wells Fargo stan-\n\f\nGood to Great 53\ndards wereferociousand consistent.Like aprofessionalsportsteam, only\nthe best made the annual cut, regardlessof position or tenure. Summed\nup one Wells Fargo executive:\"The only way to deliver to the people\nwho are achievingis to not burden them with the people who are not\nachieving.\"38\nOn the surface,this looks ruthless.But the evidence suggeststhat the\naverage Crocker manager was just not the same caliber as the average\nWells manager and would have failed in the Wells Fargo performance\nculture. If they weren'tgoingto make it on the bus in the long term, why\nlet them suffer in the short term? One senior Wells Fargo executivetold\nus: \"We all agreed this was an acquisition,not a merger, and there's no\nsensebeatingaround the bush, not beingstraightforwardwith people.We\ndecided it would be best to simply do it on day one. We planned our\neffortsso that we couldsay, right up front, 'Sorry,we don't see a role for\nyou,' or Yes, we do see a role; you have a job,so stop worryingabout it.'\nWe were not going to subject our culture to a death by a thousand\ncuts.' \"39\nTo let people languish in uncertaintyfor months oryears, stealing pre\ncioustime in their lives that theycould use tomove on to somethingelse,\nwhen in the end they aren't goingto makeitanyway—thatwouldbe ruth\nless. To deal with it right up front and let people get on with theirlives—\nthat is rigorous.\nNot that the Crocker acquisition is easy to swallow. It's never pleasant\nto seethousandsof peoplelose their jobs,but the era ofbankderegulation\nsaw hundreds ofthousandsof lostjobs. Given that, it'sinterestingto note\ntwo points. First, Wells Fargo did fewer big layoffs than its comparison\ncompany, Bank of America.40 Second, upper management, including\nsome seniorWells Fargo upper management,sufferedmore on a percent\nage basis than lower-levelworkersin theconsolidation.41Rigor in a good-\nto-greatcompany applies first at the top, focused on those who hold the\nlargestburden of responsibility.\nTo be rigorousin peopledecisionsmeans firstbecoming rigorousabout\ntop managementpeople decisions. Indeed, I fear that people might use\n\"first who rigor\" as an excuse for mindlessly chopping out people to\nimproveperformance.\"It'shard to do, butwe'vegot to berigorous,\"I can\nhear them say. And I cringe. For not onlywill a lot ofhardworking,good\npeople get hurt in theprocess,but the evidencesuggeststhat such tactics\nare contrary to producing sustained greatresults.The good-to-greatcom\npanies rarelyused head-count loppingas a tactic and almost never used it\n\f\n54 Jim Collins\nasa primarystrategy.Even in theWells Fargocase,the companyused lay\noffs halfas much asBank ofAmericaduringthe transitionera.\nIn contrast, we found layoffs used five times more frequently in the\ncomparisoncompaniesthan in the good-to-greatcompanies.Some of the\ncomparison companies had an almost chronic addiction to layoffs and\nrestructurings.42\nIt would be amistake—atragic mistake,indeed—tothink that the way\nyou ignite atransitionfrom good to great is bywantonlyswingingthe ax\non vast numbers ofhardworkingpeople. Endlessrestructuringand mind\nless hackingwere neverpart ofthe good-to-greatmodel.\nHow to Be Rigorous\nWe'veextractedthree practicaldisciplinesfrom the researchfor being rig\norous rather than ruthless.\nPracticalDiscipline#1:When in doubt, don't hire—keeplooking.\nOne of the immutable laws of management physics is \"Packard'sLaw.\"\n(So called because wefirst learned it in a previousresearch project from\nDavid Packard,cofounderof the Hewlett-PackardCompany.) It goes like\nthis: No companycan grow revenuesconsistentlyfasterthan its abilityto\nget enough ofthe rightpeopleto implementthatgrowthand still become\na great company. If your growth rate in revenues consistentlyoutpaces\nyourgrowth rate in people,yousimplywill not—indeedcannot—builda\ngreat company.\n\f\nGood to Great 55\nThe management team at Circuit City instinctively understood\nPackard'sLaw. Drivingaround Santa Barbara the day after Christmasa\nfew years ago, I noticedsomethingdifferentaboutthe CircuitCity store.\nOtherstoreshad signsand bannersreachingouttocustomers:\"Alwaysthe\nBest Prices\" or \"Great After-HolidayDeals\" or \"Best After-Christmas\nSelection,\"and so forth. But not Circuit City. It had a banner that read:\n\"AlwaysLookingfor GreatPeople.\"\nThe sign remindedme ofourinterviewwith WalterBruckart,vice pres\nident during the good-to-greatyears. When asked to name the top five\nfactors that led to the transitionfrom mediocrityto excellence,Bruckart\nsaid, \"One would be people.Two would be people.Three would be peo\nple. Four would be people.And five would be people.Ahuge partofour\ntransitioncan be attributedto ourdisciplinein pickingthe rightpeople.\"\nBruckart then recalled a conversationwith CEO Alan Wurtzel during a\ngrowth spurt at Circuit City: \" 'Alan, I'm really wearing down trying to\nfind the exact right person to fill this position or that position.At what\npoint do I compromise?'Withouthesitation,Alan said, You don't com\npromise. We find another way to get through until we find the right\npeople.'\"43\nOne ofthe key contrastsbetweenAlan Wurtzelat Circuit City and Sid\nney Cooper at Silo is thatWurtzelspent the bulk of his time in theearly\nyears focused on getting the right people on the bus, whereas Cooper\nspent80 percentofhis timefocusingonthe rightstorestobuy.44Wurtzel's\nfirstgoal was to buildthebest, mostprofessionalmanagementteamin the\nindustry;Cooper'sfirst goal was simplyto grow as fast as possible.Circuit\nCity put tremendous emphasis on getting the right people all up and\ndown the line, from deliverydrivers to vice presidents;Silo developeda\nreputationfornot beingableto do thebasics,like makinghome deliveries\nwithout damaging the products.45 According to Circuit City's Dan\nRexinger,\"We made the best home deliverydrivers in the industry.We\ntold them, Tou are the last contact the customer has with Circuit City.\nWeare goingtosupplyyou with uniforms.Wewill requirethat you shave,\nthat you don't have B.O. You're going to be professionalpeople.' The\nchange in the way we handled customerswhen making a deliverywas\nabsolutelyincredible.We wouldget thank-younotes backon how courte\nous the driverswere.\"46Fiveyears intoWurtzel'stenure, Circuit City and\nSilo had essentiallythe same businessstrategy(the same answers to the\n\"what\"questions),yet Circuit Citytook offlike a rocket,beating the gen\neral stockmarket 18.5 to 1 in thefifteenyearsafteritstransition,while Silo\n\f\n56 Jim Collins\nbumpedalonguntil itwas finallyacquiredby a foreigncompany.47Same\nstrategy,differentpeople,differentresults.\nPracticalDiscipline#2: When you know you need to make a people\nchange,act.\nThe momentyou feel the need totightlymanagesomeone,you've made\na hiring mistake. The best people don't need to be managed. Guided,\ntaught, led—yes. But not tightly managed. We've all experienced or\nobservedthe followingscenario.We have a wrong personon the busand\nwe know it. Yet we wait, we delay, we try alternatives,we give a third and\nfourth chance,we hope thatthe situationwill improve,we investtime in\ntryingto properlymanage the person,we build littlesystemsto compen\nsate for his shortcomings,andso forth. Butthe situationdoesn'timprove.\nWhen we go home, we find ourenergydivertedby thinking(or talkingto\nour spouses)aboutthat person.Worse, all thetime and energywe spend\non that one person siphons energy away from developingand working\nwith all theright people.We continueto stumblealong until the person\nleaveson hisown (to ourgreatsenseofrelief)orwe finallyact (alsoto our\ngreat sense of relief). Meanwhile, our best people wonder, \"What took\nyou solong?\"\nLettingthe wrong peoplehang around is unfairto allthe rightpeople,\nas they inevitablyfind themselvescompensatingfor the inadequaciesof\nthe wrong people. Worse, it can drive away the best people. Strongper\nformers are intrinsicallymotivatedby performance,and when they see\ntheir efforts impeded by carryingextra weight, they eventuallybecome\nfrustrated.\nWaiting too long before acting is equally unfair to the people who\nneed to get offthebus. Forevery minute you allow a personto continue\nholding a seat when youknow that person will not make it in the end,\nyou're stealinga portion of his life, time that he could spend finding a\nbetter place where he could flourish. Indeed, if we're honest with our\nselves, the reason we wait too longoften has less to do with concern for\nthat person and more to do with our own convenience.He's doing an\nokay job and it would be a huge hassle to replace him, so we avoid the\nissue. Or we find the wholeprocessof dealingwith the issue to be stress\nful and distasteful. So, to save ourselves stress and discomfort, we wait.\nAnd wait. And wait. Meanwhile,all thebest people are still wondering,\n\"Whenaretheygoingtodo somethingaboutthis? How longis this going\nto go on?\"\n\f\nGood to Great 57\nUsing data fromMoody'sCompanyInformationReports,we were able\nto examine the pattern of turnover in the top management levels. We\nfound nodifferencein the amountof\"churn\" (turnoverwithin a period of\ntime) between the good-to-greatand the comparisoncompanies. But we\ndid finddifferencesin the patternofchurn.48\n$pe gdojKo-greatcompaniesshowedthe followingbipolarpatternat\n=the fop managementlevel: Peopleeither stayed on the bus for along\nvitirne or got off the bus in a hurry. In other Words, the good-to-great\n• ^eoniparSlesdid notehurnmore,fheychurneddefer. ; <\\\nThe good-to-greatleadersdid notpursuean expedient\"trya lot of peo\nple and keep who works\" model of management. Instead, they adopted\nthe followingapproach:\"Let's take the time to make rigorousA+ selec\ntions rightup front. If we get itright, we'll do everythingwe can to tryto\nkeep them on boardfora longtime. Ifwe make a mistake,then we'llcon\nfrontthatfact sothat we cangeton with ourworkand theycan getonwith\ntheir lives.\"\nThe good-to-greatleaders, however, would not rush to judgment.\nOften, they investedsubstantialeffort in determiningwhether they had\nsomeone in the wrong seat before concludingthat they had the wrong\nperson on the bus entirely. When Colman Mockler became CEO of\nGillette,he didn'tgoon a rampage,wantonlythrowingpeopleout thewin\ndows ofa movingbus. Instead,he spentfully 55 percentofhis timeduring\nhis first two years in office jiggeringaround with the managementteam,\nchanging or moving thirty-eightof the top fifty people. Said Mockler,\n\"Every minute devoted to puttingthe proper person in the proper slot is\nworthweeksoftimelater.\"49Similarly,AlanWurtzelofCircuitCitysentus\na letterafterreadingan earlydraftofthis chapter,whereinhe commented:\nYour point about \"gettingthe right people on the bus\" as compared to\nothercompaniesisdeadon.There isone corollarythat isalso important.\nI spent a lot of time thinking andtalkingabout who sits where on the\nbus. I called it \"puttingsquare pegs in square holes and round pegs in\nround holes.\"... Insteadof firing honest and able people who are not\nperformingwell, it is important to tryto movethem once or even two or\nthree times to otherpositionswhere theymight blossom.\n\f\n58 Jim Collins\nBut how do you know when you know? Two key questions can help.\nFirst,if it werea hiring decision(ratherthan a \"should this person get off\nthe bus?\" decision),would you hire the personagain? Second, if the per\nson came to tell you that he or she isleavingto pursue an excitingnew\nopportunity,wouldyoufeel terriblydisappointedor secretiyrelieved?\nPracticalDiscipline#3:Putyour bestpeopleonyour biggestopportunities,not\nyourbiggestproblems.\nIn the early 1960s,R.J. Reynoldsand PhilipMorrisderivedthe vast major\nityof their revenuesfrom the domesticarena. R.J. Reynolds'approachto\ninternational business was, \"If somebodyout there in the world wants a\nCamel, let them call us.\"50 Joe Cullman at PhilipMorris had a different\nview. He identifiedinternationalmarketsasthe singlebestopportunityfor\nlong-termgrowth, despite the fact that the companyderivedless than 1\npercent of itsrevenuesfrom overseas.\nCullman puzzled overthe best \"strategy\"for developinginternational\noperationsand eventuallycame up with a brilliant answer: It was not a\n\"what\"answer,but a \"who.\"He pulled his number oneexecutive,George\nWeissman,offthe primarydomesticbusiness,and put him in charge of\ninternational. At the time,international amounted to almost nothing—a\ntiny exportdepartment,a strugglinginvestmentin Venezuela,another in\nAustralia, and a tiny operation in Canada. \"When Joe put George in\nchargeof international,a lot ofpeoplewonderedwhat George had done\nwrong,\"quippedoneof Weissman'scolleagues.51\"I didn'tknow whether\nI was beingthrown sideways,downstairsor out thewindow,\"said Weiss\nman. \"Here I was running 99% of the companyand the next day I'd be\nrunning 1% or less.\"52\nYet, asForbesmagazineobservedtwentyyearslater,Cullman'sdecision\nto move Weissman to the smallest part of the business was a stroke of\ngenius. Urbane and sophisticated,Weissman was the perfect person to\ndevelop markets like Europe, and he built internationalinto the largest\nand fastest-growingpart of the company.In fact, under Weissman'sstew-\n\f\nGood to Great 59\nardship, Marlboro became the best-sellingcigarette in the world three\nyears before it becamenumberonein the UnitedStates.53\nThe RJR versus Philip Morris case illustratesa common pattern. The\ngood-to-greatcompaniesmadea habitofputtingtheir bestpeople on their\nbest opportunities, not their biggestproblems.The comparison compa\nnies had a penchant for doing just theopposite,failing to grasp the fact\nthat managingyour problemscan onlymake you good, whereasbuilding\nyour opportunities is the onlyway to become great.\nth^se r?tt!e^efete.0f change. Ifyou creates place whereIhe best\n^han&esjrtdirection. . „\nFor instance, when Kimberly-Clarksold the mills, Darwin Smith made\nit clear: The company might be getting rid of the paper business,but it\nwouldkeep itsbestpeople.\"Many of our people had come up through the\npaper business.Then, all of a sudden, the crownjewelsare being sold off\nand they're asking, 'What is myfuture?'\" explainedDick Auchter. \"And\nDarwin would say, We need all the talented managers we can get. We\nkeepthem.' \"54 Despitethe fact that theyhad littleor no consumerexpe\nrience, Smith moved all the best paper people to the consumerbusiness.\nWe interviewedDick Appert,a seniorexecutivewho spent the majority\nof his career in the papermakingdivision at Kimberly-Clark,the same\ndivisionsoldoffto create fundsforthe company'sbig moveinto consumer\nproducts. He talked with pride and excitement about the transformation\nof Kimberly-Clark,how it had the guts to sell the paper mills, how it had\nthe foresightto exit the paper businessand throw the proceeds into the\nconsumer business, and how it had taken on Procter & Gamble. \"I never\nhad any argument with our decision to dissolvethe paper division of the\ncompany,\" he said. \"We did get rid of the paper mills at that time, and I\nwas in absoluteagreement with that.\"55 Stop and think about that for a\nmoment. The right people want to be part of building something great,\nand Dick Appertsaw that Kimberly-Clarkcould become great by selling\nthe part of the company where he had spent most of hisworkinglife.\nThe Philip Morris and Kimberly-Clark cases illustrate a final point\n\f\n60 Jim Collins\nabout \"the right people.\"We noticed a Level 5 atmosphereat the top\nexecutivelevel of everygood-to-greatcompany,especiallyduringthe key\ntransition years. Not that every executive on the team became a fully\nevolved Level 5 leader to thesame degree as Darwin Smith or Colman\nMockler,but each corememberofthe team transformedpersonalambi\ntion intoambitionforthe company.Thissuggeststhat the teammembers\nhad Level 5 potential—orat least they were capable of operatingin a\nmanner consistentwith theLevel 5 leadershipstyle.\nYou might be wondering,\"What's the difference between a Level 5\nexecutiveteam member and justbeing a good soldier?\"A Level 5 execu\ntive team memberdoes not blindlyacquiesceto authorityand is astrong\nleader in her own right, sodriven and talented that she builds her arena\ninto one of the very best in the world.

Duringthe courseof our conver\nsations, I asked them if they thought Colman Mockler, the CEO most\nresponsiblefor Gillette's transitionfrom good to great, had a great life.\nColman's liferevolvedaround threegreatloves, they told me: hisfamily,\nHarvard,and Gillette.Even duringthe darkestand most intensetimes of\nthe takeovercrisesof the 1980sand despitethe increasinglyglobalnature\nof Gillette's business, Mockler maintained remarkable balance in his life.\nHe did notsignificantlyreducethe amountoftime he spentwith hisfam\nily, rarely workingeveningsor weekends.He maintainedhis disciplined\nworship practices.He continuedhis active work on the governingboard\nofHarvardCollege.58\nWhen I asked how Mockler accomplished all of this, the executive\nsaid, \"Oh, it really wasn't that hard for him. He was so good at assem\nbling the right peoplearound him, and puttingthe right people in the\nright slots, that he just didn't need to be there all hours of the day and\nnight. That was Colman's whole secret to success and balance.\" The\nexecutive went on to explain that hewas just as likely to meet Mockler\nin the hardware store as at the office. \"He really enjoyed puttering\naround the house, fixing things up. He always seemed to find time to\nrelaxthat way.\" Then the executive'swife added, \"When Colman died\nand we all went to the funeral, I looked around and realized how much\nlove was in the room.

Similarly,DickAppertof Kimberly-Clarksaid in hisinterview,\n\"I neverhad anyonein Kimberly-Clarkin all myforty-oneyears say any\nthing unkind to me. I thank God the day Iwas hired because I've been\nassociatedwith wonderful people.

They wanted offbeat\nitems, like five different types of expensivesprouts and various concoc\ntionsofprotein powderand Chinese healingherbs. Oh, and they wanted\nto be able to do theirbankingand get their annual flushots while shop\nping. In short,they no longerwantedgrocerystores.They wanted Super\nstores, with a big block \"S\" on the chest—offeringalmost everything\nunder one roof, with lots of parking, cheap prices, clean floors, and a\ngazillion checkout lines.\nNow, right off the bat, you might be thinking: \"Okay, so the story of\nA&P is one of anaging companythat had astrategythat was rightfor the\ntimes,but thetimeschangedand theworldpasseditbyas younger,better-\nattuned companiesgave customersmore of what theywanted.What's so\ninterestingabout that?\"\nHere's what's interesting:Both Kroger and A&P were old companies\n(Krogerat 82 years,A&P at 111 years) headinginto the 1970s;both com\npanieshad nearlyall theirassetsinvestedin traditionalgrocerystores;both\ncompanieshad strongholdsoutsidethe majorgrowth areas of the United\nStates;and both companieshadknowledgeofhow the worldaroundthem\nwas changing.Yet one of thesetwo companiesconfrontedthe brutal facts\nof realityhead-onand completelychangedits entire system in response;\nthe other stuck its head in the sand.\nIn 1958, Forbes magazinedescribedA&P as \"the Hermit Kingdom,\"\nrun asan absolutemonarchybyan agingprince.3Ralph Burger,the suc\ncessorto theHartfordbrotherswho had builttheA&P dynasty,soughtto\npreservetwo things above all else: cash dividendsfor the family founda\ntion and the past glory of the Hartfordbrothers.Accordingto one A&P\ndirector, Burger\"considered himselfthe reincarnation of old John Hart\nford, even to the point of wearing a flower in his lapel every day from\nHartford'sgreenhouse.He tried to carryout, againstall opposition,what\nhe thought Mr. John [Hartford] would have liked.\"4Burger instilleda\n\"whatwould Mr. Hartforddo?\" approachto decisions,livingbythe motto\n\"You can't argue with a hundred years of success.\"5 Indeed, through\n\f\n68 Jim Collins\nBurger,Mr. Hartfordcontinued to be the dominant force on the board\nfor nearlytwentyyears. Nevermind the factthat hewas alreadydead.6\nAs the brutal facts about the mismatchbetween its past model and the\nchangingworld began to pile up,A&P mounted an increasinglyspirited\ndefenseagainstthose facts. In oneseriesofevents,the companyopened a\nnew store called The Golden Key, a separate brand wherein it could\nexperiment with new methods and models to learn what customers\nwanted.7Itsold noA&P-brandedproducts,itgave the storemanagermore\nfreedom,it experimentedwith innovativenew departments,and it began\nto evolve toward the modern superstore.Customers really liked it. Here,\nrightunder their noses,theybeganto discoverthe answerto thequestions\nofwhy theywere losingmarketshareand whatthey could do about it.\nWhat did A&Pexecutivesdo withThe Golden Key?\nTheydidn't like the answersthatit gave, sothey closedit.8\nA&P then began a pattern of lurching from one strategyto another,\nalways lookingfor a single-strokesolutionto its problems.It held pep ral\nlies,launched programs,grabbedfads, fired CEOs, hired CEOs, andfired\nthem yetagain.It launchedwhatone industryobservercalleda \"scorched\nearth policy,\" a radical price-cuttingstrategyto build market share, but\nnever dealt with the basic fact that customerswanted not lower prices, but\ndifferentstores.9The price cuttingled to costcutting, which led to even\ndrabber stores and poorer service,which in turn drove customers away,\nfurther driving down margins, resultingin even dirtier stores and worse\nservice. \"After a while the crud kept mounting,\" said one former A&P\nmanager.\"We not only haddirt,we haddirtydirt.\"10\nMeanwhile,overat Kroger,a completelydifferentpatternarose. Kroger\nalso conductedexperimentsin the 1960sto test the superstoreconcept.11\nBy 1970, the Kroger executiveteam came to aninescapableconclusion:\nThe old-modelgrocerystore (which accountedfor nearly 100 percent of\nKroger's business)was going to become extinct. Unlike A&P, however,\nKrogerconfrontedthis brutaltruth and actedon it.\nThe rise of Kroger is remarkablysimple and straightforward,almost\nmaddeninglyso. Duringtheirinterviews,Lyle Everinghamandhis prede\ncessorJim Herring(CEOs duringthe pivotaltransitionyears) were polite\nand helpful, but a bit exasperatedby our questions. To them, it just\nseemed so clear. When we asked Everinghamto allocate one hundred\npoints across the top five factors in the transition,he said: \"I find your\nquestion a bit perplexing.Basically,we did extensive research, and the\ndata came back loud and clear: The supercombination stores were the\n\f\nGood to Great 69\nway ofthe future. Wealso learnedthat youhad to be number one or num\nber two in eachmarket,or you had toexit.* Sure, there was some skepti\ncism at first. But oncewe lookedat thefacts, therewas reallyno question\nabout what we had to do. So we just didit.\"12\nKrogerdecidedto eliminate,change,or replaceevery singlestore and\ndepart every region that did notfit the new realities.The whole system\nwould be turned inside out, store by store, block by block, city by city,\nstate bystate. By the early 1990s, Kroger had rebuiltits entire system on\nthenew modelandwas well onthe way tobecomingthenumberonegro\ncery chain in America, a position it would attain in 1999.13 Meanwhile,\nA&P still had over half its stores in the old 1950s size and had dwindled to\na sad remnant ofaonce-greatAmericaninstitution.14\nFACTS ARE BETTER THAN DREAMS\nOne of the dominant themes from our research is that breakthrough\nresultscome about by a series ofgood decisions,diligentlyexecutedand\naccumulatedone on top ofanother.Of course,the good-to-greatcompa\nnies did not have a perfecttrack record. But on the whole, they made\nmany more good decisions than bad ones, and they made many more\ngood decisionsthanthe comparisoncompanies.Even more important,on\nthe reallybigchoices,such as Kroger'sdecisionto throw all its resources\ninto the task ofconvertingits entiresystemtothe superstoreconcept,they\nwereremarkablyon target.\nThis, ofcourse,begs a question.Are we merelystudyinga setof com\npanies that just happenedby luck to stumble into the right set ofdeci\nsions? Or was there something distinctive about their process that\ndramaticallyincreasedthe likelihoodofbeing right?The answer,it turns\nout, is thatthere was somethingquite distinctiveabouttheir process.\nThe good-to-greatcompaniesdisplayedtwo distinctiveforms of disci\nplinedthought.The first, andthe topicofthis chapter,is thatthey infused\nthe entireprocesswith the brutalfacts ofreality. (Thesecond,which we\n*Keepin mind, this was the early1970s,a full decade beforethe \"number one, num\nbertwo, or exit\" idea became mainstream.Kroger, like all good-to-greatcompanies,\ndevelopedits ideas by payingattentiontothe data rightinfront ofit,not by following\ntrendsandfads setby others. Interestingly,over halfthegood-to-greatcompanieshad\nsome version of the \"number one, number two\" concept in place years before it\nbecame a managementfad."

Strong, charismaticleaderslike Roy Ash can all too\neasily become the de facto reality driving a company. Throughoutthe\nstudy, we found comparisoncompanieswhere the top leader led with\nsuch force or instilled such fear that people worried more about the\nleader—whathe would say, what he would think, what he would do—\nthan they worriedaboutexternalrealityand what itcoulddo to the com\npany. Recall the climateat Bank ofAmerica,describedin the previous\nchapter,whereinmanagerswould not even make a commentuntil they\nknew how the CEO felt. We did not find this pattern at companies like\nWells Fargo and PitneyBowes, where people were much more worried\nabout the scary squigglythings than about the feelings of top manage\nment.\nThe moment a leaderallowshimselfto becomethe primaryrealitypeo\nple worry about, ratherthan realitybeing the primaryreality,you have a\nrecipe for mediocrity,or worse.

You can over-\nvjeorrieih§ febi)iti$sqf having charisma,but it does requireconscious\n-attention,. , ;.\nWinston Churchill understoodthe liabilitiesof his strongpersonality,\nand he compensatedfor them beautifullyduring the SecondWorld War.\nChurchill, as you know, maintained a bold and unwaveringvision that\nBritain would not just survive,but prevailas a great nation—despite the\nwholeworld wonderingnot ifbut when Britainwould sue for peace. Dur\ning the darkest days, with nearly all of Europe and North Africa under\nNazi control, the United States hoping to stay out of the conflict, and\nHitler fighting a one-front war (he had not yet turned on Russia),\nChurchill said: \"We areresolvedto destroyHitler andeveryvestigeof the\nNazi regime.From this, nothingwill turn us.Nothing!We will neverpar\nley. We will never negotiatewith Hitleror any of hisgang. We shallfight\nhim by land. We shall fight him by sea. We shall fight him in the air.\nUntil,with God's help, wehave rid the earth of hisshadow.\"31\nArmed with this bold vision, Churchill never failed, however, to con\nfront the most brutal facts. He feared that his towering, charismatic\npersonalitymight deter bad news from reaching him in its starkestform.\nSo, early in the war, he created an entirely separate department outside\nthe normal chain of command, calledtheStatisticalOffice,with the prin\ncipal function of feeding him—continuously updated and completely\nunfiltered—themostbrutal facts ofreality.32He reliedheavilyon this spe\ncial unit throughout thewar, repeatedlyaskingfor facts, just the facts. As\nthe Nazi panzers swept across Europe, Churchill went to bed and slept\nsoundly: \"I. . . had no need for cheering dreams,\" he wrote. \"Facts are\nbetter than dreams.\"33\nA CLIMATE WHERE THE TRUTH IS HEARD\nNow, you might be wondering, \"How do you motivate people with brutal\nfacts? Doesn't motivationflow chiefly from a compelling vision?\" The\n\f\n74 Jim Collins\nanswer, surprisingly,is, \"No.\" Not because vision is unimportant, but\nbecause expendingenergy trying to motivatepeople islargelya waste of\ntime. One of the dominant themesthat runs throughout this book is that\nifyou successfullyimplement itsfindings,youwill not need to spend time\nand energy\"motivating\"people. Ifyou have the right people on the bus,\ntheywill be self-motivated.The real questionthen becomes:How doyou\nmanage in such a way as not tode-motivatepeople?And one of the single\nmostde-motivatingactionsyoucan take isto hold outfalse hopes,soonto\nbe sweptaway by events.\nHow do you create a climate where the truth is heard? We offer four\nbasicpractices:\nJ. Leadwith questions,notanswers.\nIn 1973,one yearafter he assumedCEO responsibilityfrom his father,\nAlan Wurtzel'scompanystood at the brink ofbankruptcy,dangerously\nclose to violation of its loan agreements.At the time, the company\n(then named Wards,not to beconfusedwith MontgomeryWard) was a\nhodgepodge of appliance and hi-fi stores with no unifying concept.\nOver the nextten years,Wurtzeland his team not onlyturned the com\npany around, but also created the Circuit City concept and laid the\nfoundationsfor a stunningrecordofresults,beatingthe market twenty-\ntwo times from its transition date in 1982to January 1, 2000.\nWhen Alan Wurtzel started the longtraversefrom near bankruptcy\nto these stellarresults,he began with aremarkableanswerto the ques\ntion of where to take thecompany:I don'tknow. Unlike leaders such as\nRoy Ash of Addressograph,Wurtzel resisted the urge to walk in with\n\"the answer.\" Instead, once he put the right people on the bus, he\nbegan not with answers, but with questions. \"Alan was a real spark,\"\nsaid a board member. \"He had an abilityto askquestions that were just\n\f\nGood to Great 75\nmarvelous. We had some wonderful debates in the boardroom. It was\nnever just a dog and ponyshow, where you would just listen and then\ngo to lunch.\"34Indeed,Wurtzel stands as one of thefew CEOs in a\nlarge corporation who put more questions to his board members than\nthey put to him.\nHe used the same approach with his executive team, constantly\npushingand probingand proddingwith questions.Each stepalongthe\nway, Wurtzelwouldkeep askingquestionsuntil he had a clear picture\nof reality and its implications.\"They used to call me the prosecutor,\nbecauseI wouldhome in on a question,\"saidWurtzel.\"You know, like\na bulldog,I wouldn't let go until Iunderstood.Why,why, why?\"\nLike Wurtzel,leaders in each of the good-to-greattransitionsoper\nated with asomewhatSocraticstyle. Furthermore,they usedquestions\nfor one and only one reason: to gain understanding.They didn't use\nquestions as a form of manipulation (\"Don't you agree with me on\nthat? . . .\")or asa way to blameor putdown others(\"Whydid youmess\nthis up? ...\"). When we asked the executivesabouttheir management\nteam meetingsduring thetransitionera, theysaidthat they spent much\nofthe time \"justtryingto understand.\"\nThe good-to-greatleaders made particularlygood use of informal\nmeetingswhere they'd meet with groups of managersand employees\nwith no script, agenda, or set of actionitems to discuss. Instead,they\nwould startwith questionslike: \"So, what's on your mind?\" \"Can you\ntell me aboutthat?\"\"Can you help meunderstand?\"\"What should we\nbe worriedabout?\"Thesenon-agendameetingsbecamea forum where\ncurrent realities tended to bubble to the surface.\n^;;Mi^ilf^ffoW;'|godr:t|^|feat*<$j^'j^ wrth/the\n,-1 ;^||^^^ ey#f^^ wfea\n^ti^^ r^^^^^^m^;^ tftfrelies-\n2. Engagein dialogueand debate,notcoercion.\nIn 1965, you could hardly find acompany more awfiil than Nucor. It\nhad only onedivisionthat mademoney. Everythingelse drainedcash.\nIt had no culture to be proud of. It had no consistent direction. It was\n\f\n76 Jim Collins\non the verge of bankruptcy.Atthe time, Nucor was officiallyknown as\nthe Nuclear Corporation of America, reflecting its orientation to\nnuclear energy products, including the Scintillation Probe (yes, they\nreallynamed it that), usedforradiationmeasurement.It had acquired a\nseriesof unrelated businessesin such arenasas semiconductor supplies,\nrare earth materials,electrostaticoffice copiers,and roof joists. At the\nstart of its transformation in 1965, Nucor did not manufacture one\nounce of steel. Nor did it make a penny of profit. Thirty years later,\nNucorstoodas thefourth-largeststeelmakerin theworld35andby 1999\nmade greaterannualprofitsthan any otherAmericansteelcompany.36\nHow did Nucor transition from the utterly awful Nuclear Corpora\ntion of America into perhaps the best steel company inAmerica?First,\nNucor benefitedfrom the emergenceof aLevel 5 leader, KenIverson,\npromotedto CEO from generalmanagerof the joistdivision.Second,\nIversongot the rightpeopleon the bus, buildingaremarkableteam of\npeoplelike Sam Siegel (describedby one of hiscolleaguesas \"the best\nmoneymanagerin theworld,a magician\")and DavidAycock,an oper\nationsgenius.37\nAnd then what?\nLike Alan Wurtzel, Iverson dreamed of building a great company,\nbut refusedto begin with\"theanswer\"forhowto get there. Instead,he\nplayedthe role ofSocraticmoderatorin a seriesof ragingdebates.\"We\nestablishedan ongoingseriesofgeneralmanagermeetings,and myrole\nwas more as a mediator,\" commented Iverson.\"They were chaos. We\nwould stay there for hours, ironing out the issues, until we came to\nsomething.... Attimes, the meetingswould get soviolentthat people\nalmost went across the table at each other.... People yelled. They\nwaved their arms around and pounded ontables. Faces would get red\nand veins bulgedout.\"38\nIverson'sassistanttells of a scene repeated over the years, wherein\ncolleagueswould march into Iverson'soffice and yell and scream at\neach other, but then emerge with a conclusion.39Argue and debate,\nthen sell the nuclear business;argue and debate, then focus on steel\njoists; argue and debate, then begin to manufacturetheir own steel;\nargue and debate, then invest in their own mini-mill; argue and\ndebate, then build a second mini-mill, and so forth. Nearly all the\nNucor executives we spoke with described a climate of debate,\nwherein the company's strategy \"evolved through many agonizing\nargumentsand fights.\"40\n\f\nGood to Great n\n?$$&Hm$zpall14fe|^obd^gce^4scQppnl^^Wstda penchant for\nj^^feN^-f^jM',p^^er^*,tl»;\"«^ci^:%rttf intewwtranscriptsfrom\"\n;; ^ tolet\n3. Conductautopsies,withoutblame.\nIn 1978, PhilipMorris acquiredthe Seven-UpCompany,only to sell\nit eight years later at a loss.41 The financial loss was relativelysmall\ncompared to Philip Morris's total assets, but it was a highly visible\nblackeye thatconsumedthousandsofhours ofpreciousmanagement\ntime.\nIn our interviewswith the Philip Morris executives,we were struck\nby how they allbroughtup the debacleon their own and discussedit\nopenly.Insteadofhidingtheirbig, ugly mistake,theyseemedtofeel an\nalmosttherapeuticneed totalk aboutit. In his book, Ym a Lucky Guy,\nJoe Cullman dedicatesfive pages to dissectingthe 7UP disaster. He\ndoesn'thold back the embarrassingtruth about how flawed the deci\nsion was. It is a five-page clinicalanalysis of the mistake, its implica\ntions, and its lessons.\nHundreds,ifnotthousands,ofpeoplehourshad beenspentinautop\nsies ofthe 7UP case.Yet, as much as theytalkedaboutthis conspicuous\nfailure, no onepointedfingers to single out blame. There is only one\nexceptionto this pattern:Joe Cullman,standingin front ofthe mirror,\npointingthe finger rightat himself.\"[It] ... becameapparentthat this\nwas anotherJoe Cullmanplan that didn'twork,\" he writes.42He goes\neven further, implyingthat if he'd only listened better to the people\nwho challengedhis idea at the time, the disaster might have been\naverted.He goes outofhis way to give credittothose who were rightin\nretrospect,namingthose specificindividualswho were more prescient\nthan himself.\nIn an era when leadersgo to great lengthsto preservethe image of\ntheir own track record—steppingforth to claim creditabout how they\nwere visionarywhen their colleagueswere not, but finding others to\nblame when their decisionsgo awry—it is quite refreshingto come\n\f\n78 Jim Collins\nacross Cullman. He set thetone: \"J will take responsibilityfor this bad\ndecision.Butwe will all take responsibilityforextractingthe maximum\nlearningfrom the tuitionwe've paid.\"\n4. Build\"red flag\" mechanisms.\nWelive in an informationage, when those with more and betterinfor\nmation supposedlyhave an advantage.If you look across the rise and\nfall oforganizations,however,you will rarelyfind companiesstumbling\nbecause they lackedinformation.\nBethlehem Steel executiveshad known for years about the threat\nof mini-millcompanieslike Nucor. They paid littleattention until\nthey woke up oneday to discoverlarge chunksofmarketshare taken\naway.43\nUpjohn had plenty of informationthat indicatedsome of its forth\ncomingproductswouldfail todeliveranticipatedresultsor, worse,had\npotentiallyseriousside effects.Yet itoftenignoredthose problems.With\nHalcion,for example,an insiderwas quoted in Newsweeksaying,\"dis\nmissing safety concernsabout Halcion had become virtual company\npolicy.\"In anothercase when Upjohnfound itselfunderfire, itframed\nits problemsas \"adversepublicity,\"ratherthan confrontingthetruth of\nits own shortcomings.44\nExecutivesat Bank ofAmericahad plentyof informationabout the\nrealitiesofderegulation,yet theyfailedtoconfrontthe onebigimplica\ntionof those realities:In aderegulatedworld,bankingwouldbe a com\nmodity, and theold perks and genteeltraditionsofbankingwould be\ngoneforever.Not untilithad lost$1.8 billiondid BankofAmericafully\nacceptthis fact. In contrast,Carl ReichardtofWells Fargo, calledthe\nultimaterealistby hispredecessor,hit the brutal facts of deregulation\nhead-on.45Sorry, fellow bankers,but we can preservethe bankerclass\nno more. We've gotto be businessmenwith asmuch attentionto costs\nand effectiveness as McDonald's."

He simply circles the offendingitem on the invoice,deducts it\nfrom the total, and sends a check for the balance. When I asked\nWoolperthis reasonsfor shortpay, he said, \"You can geta lot ofinfor\nmationfrom customersurveys,but there arealways ways of explaining\naway the data.

It receivedabout 9 per\ncent intereston its mortgageportfoliobut had topay up to 15 percenton\nthe debt itissued.Multiplythat differencetimes $56billion,and you get\naverylargenegativenumber!Furthermore,by charter,FannieMae could\nnot diversifyoutsidethe mortgagefinancebusiness.Most peopleviewed\nFannie Mae as totally beholden to shifts in the direction of interest\nrates—theygo up andFannie Mae loses, they go down and Fannie Mae\nwins—andmanybelievedthatFannieMaecouldsucceedonly ifthe gov\nernmentsteppedin toclamp down on interestrates.54\"That'stheir only\nhope,\"said oneanalyst.55\nBut that's not the way David Maxwell and his newly assembledteam\nviewed the situation. They never wavered in their faith, consistently\nemphasizingin their interviewswith us thatthey never had the goal to\nmerelysurvivebut toprevailin the endasa greatcompany.Yes, the inter\nestspreadwas a brutalfact thatwas notgoingto magicallydisappear.Fan\nnie Mae had no choice but to become the best capital markets player in\nthe world at managingmortgageinterestrisk. Maxwell and his team set\nout to create a newbusinessmodel that woulddepend much less on inter\nest rates, involvingthe inventionof very sophisticatedmortgagefinance\ninstruments.Most analysts responded with derision. \"When you've got\n$56billion worthofloansin placeand underwater,talkingabout new pro\ngrams is a joke,\" said one. \"That'slike Chrysler[then asking for federal\nloanguaranteesto staveoffbankruptcy]goingintothe aircraftbusiness.\"56\nAfter completingmy interviewwith David Maxwell, I asked how he\nand histeam dealtwiththe naysayersduringthosedark days. \"It was never\nan issue internally,\"he said. \"Ofcourse,wehad to stop doinga lot of stu-\n\f\nGood to Great 83\npid things,and we had to inventa completelynew set of financialdevices.\nBut we never entertained thepossibilitythat wewouldfail. We weregoing\nto use the calamity as an opportunity to remake Fannie Mae into a great\ncompany.\"57\nDuring a research meeting, a team member commented that Fannie\nMae reminded her of an old television show, The Six Million Dollar Man\nwith LeeMajors.The pretextofthe seriesisthat an astronautsuffersa seri\nous crash while testing a moon landing craft over asouthwesterndesert.\nInstead of justtryingto save the patient, doctorscompletelyredesignhim\ninto a superhumancyborg,installingatomic-poweredroboticdevicessuch\nas a powerfulleft eye and mechanicallimbs.58 Similarly,David Maxwell\nand his team didn't use the fact that Fannie Mae was bleeding and near\ndeath as a pretext to merelyrestructure the company. They used it as an\nopportunity to create something muchstrongerand more powerful.Step\nby step, day by day, month by month, the Fannie Mae team rebuilt the\nentire businessmodel around risk managementand reshaped the corpo\nrate culture into a high-performancemachine that rivaled anything on\nWall Street, eventuallygenerating stock returns nearly eight times the\nmarket over fifteenyears.\nTHE STOCKDALE PARADOX\nOf course, not all good-to-greatcompaniesfaced a dire crisis like Fannie\nMae; fewer than half did. But every good-to-greatcompany facedsignifi\ncant adversityalong the way to greatness,of one sort or another—Gillette\nand the takeoverbattles,Nucor and imports,Wells Fargo and deregula\ntion, PitneyBowes losingits monopoly,AbbottLabs and a huge product\nrecall, Krogerand the need to replace nearly 100percent of itsstores,and\nso forth. In every case,the managementteam respondedwith a powerful\npsychologicalduality.On the one hand, theystoicallyaccepted the brutal\nfacts of reality.On the other hand, they maintained an unwaveringfaith\nin the endgame,and a commitmentto prevailasa greatcompany despite\nthe brutal facts. We came to call this dualitytheStockdaleParadox.\nThe name refers to Admiral Jim Stockdale, who was the highest-\nranking United States militaryofficerin the \"Hanoi Hilton\" prisoner-of-\nwar camp during the height of the Vietnam War.

After his release, Stockdale became the first three-star officer in the\nhistory of the navy to wear both aviator wings and the Congressional\nMedal of Honor.59\nYou can understand,then, my anticipationat the prospectof spending\npart of an afternoon with Stockdale.One of my students had written his\npaperon Stockdale,whohappenedto be a seniorresearchfellowstudying\nthe Stoicphilosophersat theHooverInstitutionrightacrossthe streetfrom\nmy office,and Stockdaleinvitedthe two of us for lunch. In preparation, I\nread In Loveand War, the book Stockdale and his wife had written in alter\nnating chapters,chroniclingtheir experiencesduring those eightyears.\nAs I moved through the book, I found myselfgettingdepressed.It just\nseemed so bleak—the uncertainty of his fate, the brutality of his captors,\nand so forth. And then, it dawned on me: \"Here I am sitting in my warm\nand comfortable office, looking out over the beautiful Stanford campus\non a beautifulSaturdayafternoon.I'm gettingdepressedreadingthis, and\nI knowthe end of thestory! I know that he gets out, reuniteswith his fam\nily, becomes a national hero, andgets to spend the later years of his life\nstudyingphilosophyon this same beautiful campus. If itfeels depressing\n\f\nGood to Great 85\nfor me, how on earth did he deal with it when he was actually there and\ndidnot know theendof the story?\"\n\"I never lostfaith in the end ofthestory,\"he said, when I asked him. \"I\nnever doubted not onlythat Iwould get out, butalso that I would prevail\nin the end and turn the experienceinto the defining event of my life,\nwhich, in retrospect,I would not trade.\"\nI didn't say anythingfor manyminutes,and we continued theslow walk\ntoward the faculty club, Stockdalelimping and arc-swinginghis stiffleg\nthat had never fullyrecoveredfrom repeatedtorture. Finally, after about a\nhundred meters of silence, I asked, \"Who didn't make it out?\"\n\"Oh, that's easy,\"he said. \"The optimists.\"\n\"The optimists?I don't understand,\"I said, now completelyconfused,\ngiven what he'd saida hundred metersearlier.\n\"The optimists.Oh, theywere the oneswhosaid,We're goingto be out\nby Christmas.' And Christmas would come, and Christmas would go.\nThen they'd say, 'We're going to be out by Easter.' And Easter would\ncome, and Easterwould go.And thenThanksgiving,and then it would be\nChristmas again. And they died of a broken heart.\"\nAnotherlong pause,and morewalking.Then he turned to me and said,\n\"This is a very important lesson. You must never confuse faith that you\nwillprevailin the end—whichyou can neveraffordto lose—withthe dis\ncipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality,whatever\nthey might be.\"\nTo this day, I carrya mental image ofStockdaleadmonishing the opti\nmists: \"We're not getting out byChristmas;deal with it!\"\nThat conversationwithAdmiralStockdalestayedwith me, and in fact had\na profound influence on myowndevelopment.Lifeis unfair—sometimes\nto our advantage, sometimes to our disadvantage.We will all experience\ndisappointmentsand crushing eventssomewherealong the way, setbacks\nfor which there is no \"reason,\" no one to blame. It might be disease; it\nmight be injury;it might be anaccident;it might be losinga lovedone; it\nmight be getting swept away in a politicalshake-up;it might be getting\nshot down over Vietnam and thrown into a POW camp for eight years.\nWhat separates people, Stockdale taught me, is not the presence or\n\f\n86 Jim Collins\nabsence ofdifficulty,but how they deal with theinevitabledifficultiesof\nlife. In wresdingwith life's challenges,the StockdaleParadox(you must\nretainfaith that youwill prevailin the endand youmust also confrontthe\nmost brutalfacts of your currentreality)has proved powerfulfor coming\nbackfrom difficultiesnot weakened,but stronger—notjustforme, but for\nall those who'velearnedthe lessonand triedtoapplyit.\nI neverreallyconsideredmywalk withStockdaleas part of myresearch\ninto great companies, categorizingit more as a personal rather than cor\nporate lesson. But as weunraveledthe researchevidence,I kept coming\nbackto it in myown mind. Finally,one dayduring aresearch-teammeet\ning, I shared theStockdalestory.There was silence around the table when\nI finished,and I thought,\"They mustthink I'mreallyout in leftfield.\"\nThen Duane Duffy, a quiet and thoughtful team member who had\ndone the A&P versus Krogeranalysis,said, \"That's exactlywhat I've been\nstrugglingwith. I've beentryingto get my hands around theessentialdif\nference between A&P and Kroger. And that's it. Kroger was like Stock-\ndale, andA&P was likethe optimistswhoalwaysthought they'd be out by\nChristmas.\"\nThen other team membersbegan to chime in, noting the samediffer\nence betweentheir comparisonsets—WellsFargoversusBankof America\nboth facing deregulation,Kimberly-Clarkversus Scott Paper bothfacing\nthe terrible might of Procter & Gamble, Pitney Bowes versus Addresso\ngraph both facing the loss of their monopolies,Nucor versus Bethlehem\nSteel both facing imports,and so forth. They all demonstratedthis para\ndoxicalpsychologicalpattern,and we dubbed it theStockdaleParadox.\nThe StockdaleParadoxis a signatureof all those who creategreatness,\nbe it in leading their ownlives or in leadingothers.Churchill had it dur\ning the Second World War. AdmiralStockdale,like Viktor Frankl before\nhim, lived it in a prison camp. And while our good-to-greatcompanies\ncannot claim to have experiencedeither the grandeur of saving the free\n\f\nGood to Great 87\nworld or thedepth ofpersonalexperienceoflivingin a POWcamp,they\nall embraced the Stockdale Paradox. It didn't matter how bleak the situa\ntion or how stultifyingtheir mediocrity,they all maintainedunwavering\nfaith that theywould not justsurvive,but prevailasa greatcompany.And\nyet, at thesame time, they becamerelentlesslydisciplinedat confronting\nthe most brutal facts of their current reality.\nLike much of what we found in our research,the keyelements of great\nness aredeceptivelysimpleandstraightforward.The good-to-greatleaders\nwere ableto stripawaysomuch noiseandclutterand justfocus on thefew\nthings that would have the greatestimpact. They were able to do so in\nlargepartbecausetheyoperatedfrom both sidesofthe StockdaleParadox,\nnever lettingone side overshadowthe other.

Recall how Walgreens\ngenerated cumulative stock returns from the end of 1975 to 2000 that\nexceeded the market by over fifteen times, handily beating such great\ncompaniesas GE,Merck,Coca-Cola,and Intel. It was a remarkableper\nformance for such an anonymous—somemight even say boring—com\npany. When interviewingCorkWalgreen,I keptaskinghim to godeeper,\nto help usunderstandthese extraordinaryresults.Finally,in exasperation,\nhe said, \"Look, it just wasn'tthat complicated!Once we understoodthe\nconcept,we justmoved straightahead.\"4\nWhatwas theconcept?Simplythis:thebest,mostconvenientdrugstores,\nwith high profitpercustomervisit.That'sit. That'sthebreakthroughstrat\negy that Walgreensused to beat Intel, GE,Coca-Cola,and Merck.\nIn classichedgehogstyle,Walgreenstookthis simpleconceptand imple\nmentedit with fanaticalconsistency.It embarkedon a systematicprogram\nto replaceallinconvenientlocationswith more convenientones,preferably\ncornerlotswherecustomerscouldeasilyenterand exitfrom multipledirec\ntions.

Deal makers to the core, Eckerd's\nexecutives compulsively leapt at opportunities to acquire clumps of\nstores—forty-twounits here, thirty-sixunits there—in hodgepodge fash\nion, with noobviousunifyingtheme.\n\f\n94 Jim Collins\nWhile Walgreensexecutivesunderstoodthat profitablegrowth would\ncome by pruningaway all that did not fit with the HedgehogConcept,\nEckerd executiveslurched after growth for growth's sake. In the early\n1980s, just as Walgreensbecame religiousabout carryingout its conve\nnient drugstoreconcept, Eckerd threw itselfinto the home video market\nwith its purchaseofAmericanHome Video Corporation.Eckerd'sCEO\ntoldForbesmagazinein 1981,\"Somefeel the purer weare the betterwe'll\nbe.

Then, at first under Dick Cooley and then under\nCarl Reichardt,Wells Fargoexecutivesbeganto ask themselvesa piercing\nset of questions:What can we potentiallydo better than any other com\npany, and, equallyimportant,what can we not do better than any other\ncompany?And ifwe can't be thebestat it, thenwhy arewe doingit atall?\nPuttingasidetheiregos,theWells Fargoteam pulledthe plugon thevast\nmajorityofits internationaloperations,acceptingthe truththatit couldnot\nbe better than Citicorpin global banking.13Wells Fargo then turned its\nattention to what itcouldbe the best in theworld at: running a bank like a\nbusiness, with a focus on the western UnitedStates.That's it. That was the\nessenceofthe HedgehogConceptthatturned Wells Fargofrom a mediocre\nCiticorpwanna-beto one ofthebest-performingbanks in the world.\nCarl Reichardt,CEO of Wells Fargo at the time oftransition,standsas\na consummate hedgehog. While his counterpartsat Bank of America\nwent into a reaction-revolutionpanic mode in responseto deregulation,\nhiringchangegurus who used sophisticatedmodelsand time-consuming\nencountergroups,Reichardtstrippedeverythingdown to its essentialsim\nplicity.14\"It's not spacesciencestuff,\"he told us in our interview.\"What\nwe didwas so simple,and wekept it simple.It was so straightforwardand\nobviousthat it sounds almost ridiculousto talk about it.

Ik\nEverycompanywouldlike tobethe bestatsomething,butfew actually\nunderstand—withpiercinginsightand egolessclarity—whattheyactually\nhave thepotentialtobethe bestatand, justas important,whattheycannot\nbethe bestat. And itis this distinctionthatstandsas one oftheprimarycon\ntrastsbetweenthegood-to-greatcompaniesandthe comparisoncompanies.\nConsider the contrast between Abbott Laboratoriesand Upjohn. In\n1964,thetwo companieswere almostidenticalin termsofrevenues,prof\nits, and product lines. Both companieshad the bulk of theirbusinessin\npharmaceuticals,principally antibiotics. Both companies had family\nmanagement.Both companieslaggedbehindthe restofthe pharmaceuti\ncal industry. But then, in 1974, Abbott had a breakthroughin perfor\nmance, producing cumulative returns of 4.0 times the market and 5.5\ntimes Upjohnover the nextfifteenyears. One crucialdifferencebetween\nthe two companiesis thatAbbottdevelopeda HedgehogConceptbased\non what it could be the bestat and Upjohn did not.\nAbbottbegan by confrontingthe brutalfacts. By 1964,Abbotthad lost\nthe opportunityto become the best pharmaceuticalcompany. While\n\f\nGood to Great 99\nAbbotthaddrowsilylumberedalong in the 1940s and 1950s,livingoffits\ncash cow, erythromycin,companieslike Merckhadbuilt researchengines\nthat rivaledHarvardand Berkeley.By 1964, George Cain and hisAbbott\nteam realizedthat Merck and others had such a huge researchlead that\ntryingtobethe bestpharmaceuticalcompanywouldbelike a high school\nfootballteam tryingto take on theDallasCowboys.\nEven thoughAbbott'sentire historylay in pharmaceuticals,becoming\nthe best pharmaceuticalcompany was no longer a viable option. So,\nguidedby a Level 5leaderand tappinginto thefaith side ofthe Stockdale\nParadox(Theremustbe a way for usto prevailasa greatcompany,and we\nwill find it!), the Abbottteam soughtto understandwhat it could be the\nbest at. Around 1967, a key insightemerged:We've lost the chanceto be\nthe bestpharmaceuticalcompany,but we have anopportunityto excel at\ncreatingproductsthatcontributeto cost-effectivehealthcare. Abbotthad\nexperimentedwith hospitalnutritionalproducts,designedtohelp patients\nquicklyregain theirstrengthafter surgery,and diagnosticdevices (one of\nthe primaryways to reducehealthcare costs isthroughproperdiagnosis).\nAbbotteventuallybecame the number onecompanyin both of these are\nnas, whichmoved it far down the path of becoming the best company in\nthe worldatcreatingproductsthatmake healthcare more cost-effective.18\nUpjohnneverconfrontedthe same brutalrealityandcontinuedtolive\nwith the delusion that it could beat Merck.19Later, when it fell even fur\nther behind thepharmaceuticalleaders,it diversifiedinto arenaswhereit\ndefinitelycould not be the bestin theworld,such asplasticsand chemi\ncals. As Upjohnfell even furtherbehind,it returnedto afocus on ethical\ndrugs,yetneverconfrontedthefact thatit was justtoosmallto win in the\nbig-stakespharmaceuticalgame.20 Despite consistentlyspendingnearly\ntwice the percentageof sales on R&D asAbbott, Upjohn saw its profits\ndwindletoless than halfthoseofAbbottbeforebeingacquiredin 1995.21\n? ;1$^^ dif:p$mi$e4e|tfeea^\n^yri%pw$ty%i\\i:Mdjf^ theworldat\n^\"j^^t^ff^n^ thenyourbore:t>u$ines£cannotform the basis,of\n\f\n100 Jim Collins\nClearly,a HedgehogConceptis not thesame as a core competence.\nYou can have competenceat something but not necessarilyhave the\npotentialtobe the best in theworld at it. To use an analogy,considerthe\nyoungpersonwho gets straightA's inhigh schoolcalculusand scoreshigh\non themath partofthe SAT, demonstratinga core competenceat mathe\nmatics.Doesthat mean the personshouldbecomea mathematician?Not\nnecessarily. Suppose now that this young person goes off to college,\nenrollsin math courses,and continuestoearn A's, yet encounterspeople\nwho aregeneticallyencodedfor math.As one such student said after this\nexperience, \"It would take me three hours to finish the final. Then there\nwere those who finishedthe same final in thirty minutesand earned an\nA+. Their brains are just wired differendy.I could be a very competent\nmathematician, but I soon realized I could never be one of the best.\" That\nyoungpersonmightstillgetpressurefrom parentsand friendsto continue\nwith math, saying,\"Butyou're so good at it.\" Just like our young person,\nmany peoplehave beenpulledorhave fallen intocareerswheretheycan\nneverattaincompletemasteryandfulfillment.Sufferingfrom the curseof\ncompetencebut lackinga clear HedgehogConcept,they rarelybecome\ngreatat whatthey do.\nThe HedgehogConceptrequiresa severestandardofexcellence.It'snot\njustaboutbuildingonstrengthand competence,butaboutunderstanding\nwhat your organizationtruly has the potentialto be the very bestat and\nstickingto it.Like Upjohn,the comparisoncompaniesstuckto businesses\nat whichtheywere \"good\"but couldneverbe thebest, or worse,launched\noffin pursuitofeasy growthandprofitsin arenaswhere they had nohope\nofbeingthe best. Theymade moneybutneverbecamegreat.\nEverygood-to-greatcompanyeventuallygaineddeep understandingof\nthis principleand pinned their futures on allocatingresourcesto those\n\f\nGood to Great 101\nfew arenas where they could potentiallybe the best. (See the tablebelow.)\nThe comparison companies rarelyattained this understanding.\nTHE GOOD-TO-GREAT COMPANIES AND THE \"BEST IN THE\n__ WJLR1DiTLJUJULL^\nThis table shows the understandingthe good-to-greatcompanies attained\nthat formed the foundation of their shiftfrom good to great.

Wells\nsawitselfas a businessthat happened to\nbe in banking.\"Run it like abusiness\"\nand \"Run it like you own it\" became\nmantras.Second, Wellsrecognized that\nit could not be the best in the world as a\nsuperglobalbank, but that it could be\nthe best in the western United States.\n\f\n104 Jim Collins\nINSIGHT INTO YOUR ECONOMIC ENGINE-\nWHAT IS YOUR DENOMINATOR?\nThe good-to-greatcompaniesfrequentlyproduced spectacularreturns in\nvery unspectacularindustries.The bankingindustryrankedin the bottom\nquartile of industries (in total returns) during the same period that\nWells Fargo beat the marketby fourtimes. Even more impressive,both\nPitney Bowes and Nucor were in bottom 5 percent industries; yet both\nthese companies beat the marketbywell overfive times. Only one of the\ngood-to-greatcompanies had the benefit of being in a great industry\n(definedas a top 10 percentindustry);five were in good industries;five\nwere in bad to terrible industries.(See Appendix 5.A for a summary of\nindustryanalysis.)\ngreat ;n4uptry,t-UA-—w* ~~*~**~~*&~»*^~ui>^^^~^ **^ ,\nparly iuHl^\nThey wefi al\nintothefr^ondrfitesr^\nThey wei^ abfefej4o t^rbT#c||sieifey^ftateMi^^ %\nv^ /<., /VY^< >:V>lu iV*'F:\nThis is not a book onmicroeconomics.Each company and each indus\ntry had its own economicrealities,and I'm not going to belabor them all\nhere. The central point is that each good-to-greatcompany attained a\ndeep understandingof thekey driversin itseconomic engine and built its\nsystemin accordancewiththis understanding.\nThat said, however,we did notice oneparticularlyprovocativeform of\neconomic insightthateverygood-to-greatcompanyattained,the notion of\na single \"economic denominator.\" Think about it in terms of the follow\ning question:Ifyou couldpick oneand only one ratio—profitper x (or, in\nthe socialsector,cashflow perx)—tosystematicallyincreaseovertime, what\nx would have the greatestand most sustainableimpact on your economic\nengine?We learned that thissinglequestionleadsto profound insightinto\nthe inner workingsof an organization'seconomics.\nRecall howWalgreensswitchedits focus from profit per store to profit\nper customervisit. Convenient locationsare expensive,but by increasing\nprofit per customer visit, Walgreens was able to increase convenience\n(nine storesin a mile!)andsimultaneouslyincreaseprofitabilityacross its\n\f\nGood to Great 105\nentire system.The standard metric of profitper store would have run con\ntraryto the convenience concept. (The quickest way to increase profit per\nstore is to decrease the number of stores and put them in less expensive\nlocations.This would havedestroyedthe convenience concept.)\nOr consider Wells Fargo. When the Wells team confronted the brutal\nfact that deregulation would transformbanking into a commodity, they\nrealized that standard banker metrics, like profit per loan and profit per\ndeposit,would no longer be the key drivers. Instead,they graspeda new\ndenominator: profit per employee. Following this logic, Wells Fargo\nbecame one of the first banksto change its distributionsystemto relypri\nmarily on stripped-downbranches and ATMs.\nffe-<^nomin^ofean be quitesubtle,sometimeseven unobvious.The\nk%i? to use thequestionof the denominatorto gain understanding\narifc^\nFor example, Fannie Maegraspedthe subtle denominator of profit per\nmortgage risk level, not per mortgage (which would be the \"obvious\"\nchoice). It's a brilliantinsight.The real driverin Fannie Mae's economics\nis the abilityto understandrisk ofdefault in a packageof mortgagesbetter\nthan anyone else. Then it makes money selling insurance and managing\nthe spread on that risk. Simple, insightful,unobvious—andright.\nNucor, for example, made its mark in theferociouslyprice competitive\nsteel industrywith the denominator profitper ton of finished steel. Atfirst\nglance, you might think that peremployeeor per fixed cost might be the\nproper denominator. But the Nucor people understood that the driving\nforce in its economic engine was a combination of a strong-work-ethic\nculture andthe applicationofadvancedmanufacturingtechnology.Profit\nper employee or per fixed cost would not capture this duality as well as\nprofit per ton of finished steel.\nDo you need to have a single denominator? No, but pushing for a sin\ngle denominator tends to produce better insight than letting yourselfoff\nthe hook with three or four denominators. The denominator question\nservesas a mechanism toforce deeper understandingof the keydriversin\nyour economic engine. As the denominator question emerged from the\nresearch, we tested the question on a number of executive teams. We\nfound that the question always stimulated intense dialogue and debate.\n\f\n106 )im Collins\nFurthermore,even incases where the teamfailed (or refused)to identify\na singledenominator,the challengeofthe questiondrove them to deeper\ninsight.Andthat is,afterall, the point—tohavea denominator not forthe\nsake ofhavinga denominator,but for the sake ofgaininginsightthat ulti\nmatelyleads to more robustand sustainableeconomics.\nECONOMIC DENOMINATOR\nThistableshowsthe economicdenominatorinsightattainedbythe good-to-\ngreatcompaniesduring the pivotaltransitionyears.\nAbbott: per employee Keyinsight:Shiftfromprofitper prod\nuct line to profitperemployeefit with\nthe ideaof contributingto cost-effective\nhealth care.\nCircuit City: per Keyinsight: Shiftfrom profitper single\ngeographicregion storeto profitper regionreflectedlocal\neconomiesofscale.While per-storeper\nformanceremainedvital,regional\ngroupingwas a keyinsightthat drove\nCircuit City's economics beyond Silo's.\nFannie Mae: per mortgage Keyinsight:Shiftfrom profitper mort\nrisk level gage to profitper mortgagerisk level\nreflectedthe fundamentalinsightthat\nmanaginginterestriskreduces depen\ndence on the direction of interest rates.\nGillette: per customer Keyinsight:Shiftfromprofitper divi\nsion to profitper customerreflectedthe\neconomicpowerof repeatablepurchases\n(e.g.,razorcartridges)timeshigh profit\nperpurchase(e.g.,Mach3,notdisposable\nrazors).\nKimberly-Clark:per Key insight:Shiftfrom profitper fixed\nconsumer brand asset(the mills) to profitper consumer\nbrand; would be lesscyclicaland more\nprofitablein goodtimes and bad."

Recallfrom chapter 3 how George\nWeissmandescribedworkingat the companyasthe greatlove affairof his\nlife, second only to his marriage. Even with a most sinful collection of\nconsumerproducts(Marlborocigarettes,Millerbeer, 67 percentfat-filled\nVelveeta, Maxwell House coffee for caffeine addicts, Toblerone for choco\nholics,and so forth), we found tremendouspassionfor the business.Most\nof the top executivesat Philip Morris were passionate consumers of their\nown products. In 1979,Ross Millhiser,then vice chairman of Philip Mor\nris and a dedicatedsmoker,said, \"I love cigarettes.It's one of the things\nthat makes lifereallyworthliving.\"24\nThe Philip Morrispeople clearlyloved their company and hadpassion\nfor what they were doing. It's as if they viewed themselvesas the lone,\nfiercely independent cowboy depicted in the Marlboro billboards. \"We\nhave a right to smoke, and we will protect that right!\" A board member\ntold me during myresearchfora previousproject,\"I reallylove being on\n\f\nGood to Great 109\ntheboardofPhilipMorris.It's like beingpartofsomethingreallyspecial.\"\nShe said thisas she proudlypuffedaway.25\nNow, you might say, \"But that is just the defensivenessof the tobacco\nindustry.Ofcoursethey'dfeel that way. Otherwise,how could they sleep\nat night?\" But keep in mind that R. J. Reynolds was also in the tobacco\nbusiness and under siege from society. Yet, unlike Philip Morris, R. J.\nReynoldsexecutivesbegan to diversifyaway from tobaccointo any arena\nwhereitcouldget growth,regardlessofwhethertheyhad passionfor those\nacquisitionsor whether the company could be the best in the world at\nthem. The Philip Morris people stuck much closer to the tobacco busi\nness, in large part becausethey loved that business.In contrast,the R. J.\nReynolds people saw tobacco as just a way to make money. As vividly\nportrayedin the book Barbariansat the Gate, R. J. Reynolds executives\neventually lost passion for anything except making themselves rich\nthrougha leveragedbuyout.26\nItmayseem odd totalkaboutsomethingas softandfuzzyas \"passion\"as\nan integral part of a strategicframework.

Perhaps you\nmightfind it hardto imaginebeingpassionateaboutpharmacies,grocery\nstores,tobacco,or postagemeters.You might wonderaboutwhat type of\npersongets all jazzedupaboutmakinga bankas efficientas McDonald's,\nor who considersa diapercharismatic.In the end, it doesn'treallymatter.\nThe pointis thatthey felt passionateaboutwhat they were doingand the\npassionwas deep and genuine.\nThis doesn't mean,however,that you have to be passionateabout the\nmechanicsof the businessper se (althoughyou might be). The passion\ncirclecan befocused equallyon what the companystandsfor.

But they were\nterrificallymotivatedby the whole idea of helpingpeople of allclasses,\nbackgrounds,and racesrealizethe Americandreamofowningtheirhome.\nLindaKnight,who joinedFannieMae in 1983, justas thecompanyfaced\nits darkestdays, told us: \"This wasn't justany old companygetting into\ntrouble;thiswas a companyat thecore ofmakinghomeownershipa real\nity for thousandsofAmericans.It's a role thatis far more importantthan\njustmakingmoney,andthat'swhy we felt such depth ofcommitmentto\npreserve,protect,and enhancethe company.\"30As anotherFannie Mae\nexecutivesummedup,\"I see usas a key mechanismfor strengtheningthe\nwhole socialfabric ofAmerica.WheneverI drive throughdifficultneigh\nborhoodsthatare comingbackbecausemore familiesown theirhomes,I\nreturn to work reenergized.\"\nTHE TRIUMPH OF UNDERSTANDING\nOVER BRAVADO\nOn theresearchteam,we frequentlyfound ourselvestalkingaboutthe dif\nference between \"prehedgehog\"and \"posthedgehog\"states. In the pre-\nhedgehogstate, it's like gropingthroughthe fog. You're makingprogress\non along march, but you can'tsee all that well. At each juncturein the\ntrail, you can only see a little bit ahead and must move at a deliberate,\nslow crawl.Then, with the HedgehogConcept,you breakintoa clearing,\n\f\nGood to Great 111\nthe fog lifts, and you can see for miles. From then on, each juncture\nrequires less deliberation, and you can shiftfromcrawl to walk, and from\nwalk to run. In theposthedgehogstate,miles oftrail move swiftlybeneath\nyour feet, forks in the road fly pastasyou quicklymake decisionsthat you\ncouldnot have seenso clearlyin thefog.\nWhat'sso strikingaboutthecomparisoncompaniesis that—forall their\nchange programs, frantic gesticulations,and charismaticleaders—they\nrarelyemergedfrom thefog. Theywould try torun, makingbad decisions\nat forks in the road, and thenhave to reversecourselater. Or they would\nveer off the trail entirely, banging into trees and tumbling down\nravines.(Oh,but they were sure doing it with speedand panache!)\n/r$f& 4h^#pj^^^ *wortel\"that had -\n^becoiMy^ot^ple and clear to th§ good-to-great companies\n'^j|fen^ treasons, First,\nNowhere is this more evident than in the comparison companies'\nmindlesspursuitofgrowth:Over two thirdsofthe comparisoncompanies\ndisplayedan obsession with growth without the benefitof a Hedgehog\nConcept.31Statementssuch as \"We've been a growth at any price com\npany\" and \"Bettingthat size equals success\"pepperthe materialson the\ncomparisoncompanies.In contrast,not one of thegood-to-greatcompa\nnies focused obsessivelyon growth.Yet they createdsustained,profitable\ngrowthfar greaterthanthe comparisoncompaniesthatmade growththeir\nmantra.\nConsider the case of Great Western and Fannie Mae. \"Great Western is\na mite unwieldy,\" wrote the Wall Street Transcript \"It wants to grow\neverywayit can.\"32 The companyfound itselfin finance, leasing, insur\nance, and manufacturedhouses, continuallyacquiringcompaniesin an\nexpansionbinge.33 Bigger! More! In 1985, GreatWestern'sCEO told a\ngatheringof analysts,\"Don't worry about what you call us—a bank, an\nS&L, or a Zebra.\"34\nQuite a contrastto Fannie Mae, whichhad asimple,crystallineunder\nstanding that it could be the best capital markets player in anything\n\f\n112 Jim Collins\nrelatedto mortgages,bettereven than GoldmanSachsor SalomonBroth\ners in openingup thefull capitalmarketsto themortgageprocess.It built\na powerful economic machine by reframingits business model on risk\nmanagement,rather than mortgage selling. And it drove the machine\nwith great passion, the Fannie Mae people inspired by its vital role in\ndemocratizinghome ownership.\nUntil 1984,the stockchartstrackedeach otherlikemirror images.Then\nin 1984, one year after it clarified its Hedgehog Concept, Fannie Mae\nexplodedupward, while GreatWesternkept lollygaggingalong until just\nbefore its acquisitionin 1997. By focusingon its simple,elegantconcep\ntion—and not just focusing on \"growth\"—FannieMae grew revenues\nnearlythreefoldfrom its transitionyear in 1984through1996. GreatWest\nern, for all ofits gobblingofgrowth steroids,grew revenuesand earnings\nonly 25 percentoverthe same period,thenlost its independencein 1997.\nThe HedgehogConceptis a turningpointin the journeyfrom good\nto great. In most cases, the transitiondate follows within a few years of\nthe HedgehogConcept. Furthermore,everythingfrom here on out in\nthe book hinges upon havingthe HedgehogConcept.As will become\nabundantly clear in the following chapters, disciplined action—the\nthird big chunk in the framework after disciplinedpeople and disci\nplined thought—onlymakes sense in the context of the Hedgehog\nConcept.\nDespiteits vital importance(or, rather,becauseofits vital importance),\nit would be a terriblemistaketo thoughtlesslyattemptto jump rightto a\nHedgehog Concept. You can't just go off-site for two days, pull out a\nbunch offlip charts,do breakoutdiscussions,and come up with a deep\nunderstanding.Well,you can do that, butyou probablywon'tgetit right.\nIt wouldbe likeEinstein saying,\"I think it'stime to become a greatscien\ntist, so I'm going to go offto theFour Seasonsthis weekend,pull out the\nflip charts, and unlock the secrets of the universe.\"Insight just doesn't\n\f\nGood to Great 113\nFannie Mae, Great Western, and the General Market\nCumulative Value of $1 Invested,\n1970-1984\n$10\n1970 1977\nNotes:\n1.

You never just focus on what you've accomplished for the\nyear; youfocus on whatyou'veaccomplishedrelativeto exactlywhatyou\nsaid you weregoingto accomplish—nomatter how tough themeasure.\nThatwas a disciplinelearnedatAbbott,andthat we carriedintoAmgen.3\n\f\nGood to Great 123\nMany of the Abbott disciplinestrace back to 1968, when it hired a\nremarkable financial officer named Bernard H. Semler. Semler did not see\nhis job as a traditional financial controller oraccountant Rather, he set out\nto inventmechanismsthat woulddriveculturalchange. He createda whole\nnew framework of accounting that he called ResponsibilityAccounting,\nwhereineveryitem ofcost, income,and investmentwouldbe clearlyidenti\nfied with a singleindividualresponsiblefor thatitem.4The idea, radicalfor\nthe 1960s,was to createa systemwhereineveryAbbottmanagerin everytype\nof job was responsiblefor his or her return on investment,with the same\nrigorthat aninvestorholdsan entrepreneurresponsible.There wouldbe no\nhiding behindtraditionalaccountingallocations,no sloppingfunds about\nto coverup ineffectivemanagement,no opportunitiesfor finger-pointing.5\nBut the beautyof theAbbottsystemlaynot justin its rigor,but in how it\nused rigor and discipline to enable creativity and entrepreneurship.\n\"Abbottdevelopeda very disciplinedorganization,but not in a linear way\nof thinking,\"said George Rathmann.\"[It] was exemplaryat having both\nfinancial discipline and the divergentthinking ofcreativework. We used\nfinancial discipline as a way to provide resources for the really creative\nwork.\"6Abbott reduced its administrativecosts as a percentageof sales to\nthe lowest in the industry (by a significantmargin) and at the same time\nbecame a new productinnovationmachine like 3M,derivingup to 65 per\ncent ofrevenuesfrom newproductsintroducedin thepreviousfouryears.7\nThis creativedualityran through everyaspectofAbbottduring the tran\nsition era, woven into the veryfabric of the corporate culture.

Abbott instilled the entrepreneur's zeal for oppor\ntunistic flexibility.(\"We recognized that planning is priceless, but plans\nare useless,\" said one Abbott executive.)8But Abbott also had the disci\npline to say no to opportunities that failed the three circles test. While\nencouraging wide-ranginginnovationwithin its divisions,Abbott simulta\nneouslymaintained fanaticaladherence to its HedgehogConcept of con\ntributing to cost-effectivehealth care.\nAbbottLaboratoriesexemplifiesa key findingofour study: a cultureof 1\ndiscipline.Byitsnature, \"culture\" isa somewhatunwieldytopic to discuss,\nless prone to clean frameworkslike the three circles. The main points of\nthis chapter, however,boil down to one central idea:Builda culturefull of\n\f\n124 Jim Collins\npeoplewho take disciplinedactionwithin the three circles,fanaticallycon\nsistentwith the HedgehogConcept\nMore precisely,this means thefollowing:\n1.

We're going to\ngive it another try.\" On the next go, the winds calm just enough and she\nbringsthe plane down, safely.\nNow take a step back and think about the model here.

But within the boundariesof that sys\ntem, store managershad a lot ofleeway,to coincidewith theirresponsibil\nity.\"9 In a sense, CircuitCity became to consumerelectronicsretailing\nwhat McDonald's became to restaurants—notthe most exquisiteexperi\nence, but an enormouslyconsistentone. The systemevolvedover time as\nCircuit City experimentedbyadding new itemslike computers and video\nplayers(justlike McDonald's addedbreakfastEggMcMuffins).But at any\ngiven moment, everyone operated within the frameworkof the system.\n\"That's one of the major differences between us and all the others who\nwere in this same businessin the early 1980s,\"said Bill Zierden. \"They\njustcouldn't roll it out further, and wecould.We could stamp thesestores\nout allover the country,with greatconsistency.\"10Therein liesone ofthe\nkeyreasonswhyCircuit City tookoffin the early 1980sand beat the gen\neral stockmarket by more than eighteen times overthe nextfifteenyears.\nIn a sense,much of this bookisabout creatinga culture of discipline. It\nall startswithdisciplinedpeople.The transitionbeginsnot bytryingto dis\ncipline the wrong people into the right behaviors,but by getting self-\ndisciplinedpeople on the bus in the first place. Next we have disciplined\nthought. You need the discipline to confront the brutal facts of reality,\nwhile retainingresolutefaith that you can andwill create a path to great\nness. Most importantly,you need the disciplineto persistin the search for\nunderstanding until you get your HedgehogConcept. Finally, we have\ndisciplined action, the primary subject of this chapter. This order is\nimportant. The comparisoncompaniesoften tried to jump right to disci\nplined action. But disciplined action without self-disciplinedpeople is\nimpossibleto sustain,and disciplinedaction withoutdisciplinedthought\nis a recipe fordisaster.\nIndeed, discipline by itself will not produce great results. We find\nplentyof organizationsin historythat hadtremendousdisciplineand that\nmarched rightinto disaster,withprecisionand in nicelyformedlines. No,\nthe point is tofirstget self-disciplinedpeople who engage invery rigorous\nthinking,who then take disciplinedactionwithinthe frameworkofa con\nsistentsystemdesignedaround the HedgehogConcept.\n\f\nGood to Great 127\nRINSING YOUR COTTAGE CHEESE\nThroughoutour research,we were struckby the continualuse ofwords\nlike disciplined,rigorous, dogged, determined,diligent,precise, fastidious,\nsystematic, methodical, workmanlike, demanding, consistent, focused,\naccountable, and responsible. They peppered articles, interviews, and\nsource materials on the good-to-greatcompanies, and were strikingly\nabsentfrom the materialson the directcomparisoncompanies.Peoplein\nthegood-to-greatcompaniesbecamesomewhatextremein thefulfillment\noftheir responsibilities,borderingin some cases on fanaticism.\nWecameto callthisthe \"rinsingyour cottagecheese\"factor.The anal\nogy comesfrom a disciplinedworld-classathletenamed Dave Scott,who\nwonthe HawaiiIronmanTriathlon six times.In training,Scottwouldride\nhis bike 75 miles, swim 20,000 meters, and run 17 miles—on average,\nevery single day. Dave Scott did not have a weight problem! Yet he\nbelievedthat a low-fat, high-carbohydratediet would give him an extra\nedge. So, Dave Scott—a man who burned at least 5,000 caloriesa day\nin training—wouldliterallyrinse his cottage cheese to get the extra fat\noff. Now, there is no evidence that he absolutely needed to rinse his\ncottagecheese to win the Ironman;that's not the pointof thestory. The\npoint is that rinsing his cottage cheese was simply one more small step\nthat he believed would make him just that much better, one more small\nstep added to all the other small steps to create a consistent program\nofsuperdiscipline.I've always picturedDave Scott runningthe 26 miles\nofthe marathon—hammeringaway in hundred-degreeheat on theblack,\nbaked lavafields of the Kona coastafterswimming2.4 miles in the ocean\nand cycling 112 miles against ferocious crosswinds—andthinking to\n\f\n128 Jim Collins\nhimself:\"Comparedto rinsingmy cottagecheeseeveryday, this just isn't\nthat bad.\"\nI realizethatit'sa bizarreanalogy.Butina sense,thegood-to-greatcom\npanies became like Dave Scott. Much of theanswer to the questionof\n\"goodto great\"liesin the disciplineto dowhateverit takes to become the\nbest withincarefullyselectedarenasand then toseek continualimprove\nmentfrom there.It's reallyjustthatsimple.And it's reallyjustthatdifficult.\nConsiderWells Fargo in contrastto Bank of America. Carl Reichardt\nneverdoubtedthatWellsFargocouldemergefrom bankderegulationas a\nstrongercompany,not aweakerone. He saw that thekey to becominga\ngreatcompanyrested not with brilliantnewstrategiesbut with the sheer\ndeterminationto rip a hundredyears of banker mentalityout of thesys\ntem. \"There'stoo muchwaste inbanking,\"said Reichardt.\"Gettingridof\nit takes tenacity,not brilliance.\"11\nReichardtseta cleartoneatthe top: We'renotgoingtoask everyoneelse\ntosufferwhilewe sitonhigh.We willstartby rinsingourown cottagecheese,\nrighthere in theexecutivesuite. He froze executivesalariesfor two years\n(despitethefactthatWellsFargowas enjoyingsome ofthe mostprofitable\nyears in its history).12He shut the executivediningroom and replacedit\nwitha collegedormfood-servicecaterer.13He closedthe executiveelevator,\nsold the corporatejets,andbannedgreenplantsfrom the executivesuiteas\ntoo expensiveto water.14He removedfreecoffeefrom the executivesuite.\nHeeliminatedChristmastreesfor management.15Hethrewreportsbackat\npeoplewho'd submittedthem in fancy binders,with the admonishment:\n\"Wouldyou spend your own moneythis way?

Sometimeshe would\njustsitthere and pickat the stuffingwhile listeningto proposalsto spend\nmoney,said onearticle,\"[and]a lotofmust-doprojectsjustmeltedaway.\"17\nAcross the streetat Bank ofAmerica,executivesalso faced deregulation\nandrecognizedtheneed toeliminatewaste. However,unlikeWells Fargo,\n\f\nGood to Great 129\nB of A executivesdidn't have the disciplineto rinse their own cottage\ncheese.Theypreservedtheirposh executivekingdomin its imposingtower\nin downtown San Francisco, the CEO's office described in the book\nBreakingthe Bank as\"a northeastcornersuitewith a largeattachedconfer\nence room,orientalrugs,and floor-to-ceilingwindowsthatoffereda sweep\ning panoramaof the SanFranciscoBay from the Golden Gate to theBay\nBridge.\"18 (We found no evidence of executive chairs with the stuffing\nhanging out.) The elevatormade its last stop at the executivefloor and\ndescendedall the way to the ground in one quiet whoosh, unfetteredby\nthe intrusionsof lesserbeings.The vast open space in the executivesuite\nmade the windows look even taller than they actually were, creating a\nsense of floatingabove the fog in an elevatedcityof alieneliteswho ruled\ntheworldfrom above.19Why rinseourcottagecheesewhen life is so good?\nAfterlosing$1.8 billionacrossthreeyears in themid-1980s,B ofAeven\ntuallymade the necessarychangesin responseto deregulation(largelyby\nhiringex-Wellsexecutives).20Buteven in thedarkestdays, BofA couldnot\nbring itselfto get rid of theperks that shieldeditsexecutivesfrom the real\nworld. Atone board meetingduring Bank ofAmerica'scrisis period,one\nmember made sensible suggestionslike \"Sell the corporate jet.\" Other\ndirectorslistenedto therecommendations,then passedthem by.21\nA CULTURE, NOT A TYRANT\nWe almostdidn't include this chapter in thebook. On the one hand, the\ngood-to-greatcompaniesbecame more disciplinedthan the direct com\nparison companies, as withWells Fargo in contrast to Bank ofAmerica.\nOn the other hand, theunsustainedcomparisonsshowedthemselvesto be\njustas disciplinedasthe good-to-greatcompanies.\n\"Based on my analysis,I don'tthink we can putdisciplinein the book\nas a finding,\"said Eric Hagen, after he completeda specialanalysisunit\nlookingat the leadershipculturesacross the companies.\"It isabsolutely\nclear that theunsustainedcomparisonCEOs broughttremendousdisci\nplinetotheir companies,andthat is why theygotsuch greatinitialresults.\nSo, disciplinejustdoesn'tpass musteras a distinguishingvariable.\"\nCurious, we decided to look further into the issue, and Eric undertook\na more in-depth analysis.As we further examined the evidence, it became\nclearthat—despitesurfaceappearances—therewas indeeda huge differ\nence betweenthe two sets ofcompaniesin theirapproachto discipline."

Firstcame a con\nsentdecreethatrequiredPitneyBowesto licenseits patentstocompetitors,\nroyaltyfree.41 Withinsix years,PitneyBoweshad sixteencompetitors.42Pit\nney fell into a reactionary\"ChickenLittle/thesky is falling\"diversification\nfrenzy, throwing cash after ill-fated acquisitions and joint ventures,\nincludinga $70 millionbloodbath(54 percentofnet stockholders'equity\nat the time) from a computer retail foray. In 1973, the company lost\nmoneyfor thefirst time in its history.Itwas shapingup to bejustanother\ntypical case of a monopoly-protectedcompany gradually falling apart\nonceconfrontedwith the harsh realityofcompetition.\nFortunately,a Level 5 leader named Fred Allen stepped in and asked\nhard questionsthat led to deeper understandingof Pitney's role in the\nworld. Instead of viewing itself as a \"postage meter\" company, Pitney\n\f\n134 Jim Collins\ncame to see that it could be the best in the world at servicingthe back\nrooms of businesseswithin the broader concept of \"messaging.\"It also\ncame to see that sophisticatedback-officeproducts,like high-end faxes\nandspecializedcopiers,playedrightinto its economicengineofprofitper\ncustomer,buildingoffits extensivesales andservicenetwork.\nAllenandhis successor,GeorgeHarvey,instituteda modelofdisciplined\ndiversification.For example, Pitney eventuallyattained45 percentof the\nhigh-endfax marketfor largecompanies,ahugelyprofitablecashmachine.43\nHarvey began a systematicprocess ofinvestmentin new technologiesand\nproducts,such as the Paragonmail processorthatsealsand sendsletters,and\nby thelate 1980s, Pitney consistentlyderived over half its revenuesfrom\nproducts introduced in the previous three years.44 Later, Pitney Bowes\nbecame a pioneer at linking backroom machines to the Internet, yet\nanother opportunityfor disciplineddiversification.The key point is that\neverystep ofdiversificationand innovationstayedwithinthe threecircles.\nAfter falling77percentbehindthe marketfrom the consentdecree to\nits darkestdays in 1973,PitneyBowes reversedcourse,eventuallyrisingto\nover eleventimesthe marketbythe startof 1999. From 1973 to 2000, Pit\nney Bowes outperformedCoca-Cola,3M, Johnson & Johnson, Merck,\nMotorola, Procter & Gamble, Hewlett-Packard,Walt Disney, and even\nGeneralElectric.Can you thinkofany othercompanythatemergedfrom\nthe protective comfort of a monopoly cocoon to deliver this level of\nresults? AT&T didn't. Xerox didn't. Even IBM didn't.\nPitney Bowes illustrateswhat can happen when a companylacks the\ndisciplineto stay within the three circlesand, conversely,what can hap\npen whenit regainsthat discipline.\nIn contrast,wefound a lackofdisciplineto staywithinthe three circles\nas a key factor in the demise of nearly all the comparisoncompanies.\nEvery comparisoneither(1) lackedthe disciplineto understandits three\ncirclesor (2) lackedthe disciplineto staywithinthe threecircles.\n\f\nGood to Great 135\nR.J. Reynolds is a classic case. Until the 1960s, R.J. Reynolds had a\nsimple and clear concept,built around being the besttobaccocompany\nin the UnitedStates—apositionit had heldfor at leasttwenty-fiveyears.45\nThen in 1964, the SurgeonGeneral'sOffice issued its reportthat linked\ncigaretteswith cancer, and R. J. Reynolds began to diversifyaway from\ntobaccoas a defensivemeasure.Of course,all tobaccocompaniesbegan\nto diversifyat thattime for the same reason,includingPhilipMorris. But\nR. J. Reynolds'wanderingsoutsideits three circlesdefiedalllogic.\nR. J. Reynoldsspent nearly a third oftotal corporateassets in 1970 to\nbuy a shippingcontainercompanyand an oil company (Sea-Landand\nAminoil),the idea beingto make moneyby shippingits own oil.46 Okay,\nnot aterribleideaon its own. Butwhaton earthdid ithave to dowith R. J.\nReynolds'HedgehogConcept?It was a wholly undisciplinedacquisition\nthat came about in partbecauseSea-Land'sfounderwas a close friend of\nR. J. Reynolds'chairman.47\nAfter pouring more than $2 billion intoSea-Land,the total investment\nnearly equaled the entire amount of netstockholders'equity.48 Finally,\nafter years of starvingthe tobaccobusinessto funnelfunds into the sink\ning ship business,RJR acknowledgedfailure and sold Sea-Land.49One\nReynoldsgrandsoncomplained:\"Look, these guys are the world'sbest at\nmakingand sellingtobaccoproducts,butwhat do they know aboutships\noroil? I'mnot worriedaboutthem goingbroke,butthey look like country\nboys with too muchcash in theirpockets.\"50\nTo be fair, Philip Morris did not have a perfectdiversificationrecord\neither,asevidencedbyits failed purchaseof7UP. However,in stark con\ntrast to R.J. Reynolds, Philip Morris displayed greater discipline in\nresponseto the 1964 surgeongeneral'sreport. Instead ofabandoningits\nHedgehog Concept, Philip Morris redefined its Hedgehog Concept in\nterms of buildingglobal brands in not-so-healthyconsumables(tobacco,\nbeer, soft drinks,coffee,chocolate,processedcheese,etc.). PhilipMorris'\nsuperiordisciplineto stay within the three circles is one key reason why\nthe results of thetwo companiesdivergedso dramaticallyafter the 1964\nreport,despitethefact thatthey both faced theexactsame industryoppor\ntunitiesandthreats.From 1964to 1989 (when R. J. Reynoldsdisappeared\nfrom public tradingin aleveragedbuyout),$1 investedin Philip Morris\nbeat$1 investedin R. J.

Those who built thegood-to-greatcompanies,\nhowever,made as much use of\"stop doing\" lists as \"todo\" lists. Theydis\nplayeda remarkabledisciplineto unplugall sorts ofextraneousjunk.\nWhen Darwin Smith becameCEO ofKimberly-Clark,he made great\nuse of \"stop doing\" lists. He saw that playing the annual forecastgame\nwith Wall Street focused people too much on the short term, so he just\nstoppeddoing it. \"Onbalance,I see no netadvantageto ourstockholders\nwhen we annuallyforecastfuture earnings,\"said Smith. \"We will not do\nit\"65 Hesaw \"titlecreep\"as a sign ofclass-consciousnessandbureaucratic\nlayering,so he simply unpluggedtitles.

He saw increasinglayers as the natural resultof empire building.\n\f\n140 Jim Collins\nSo he simply unplugged a huge stack of layers with a simple elegant\nmechanism: If you couldn't justifyto your peers the need for at least fif\nteen people reporting to you to fulfill your responsibilities,then you\nwould have zero peoplereportingtoyou.66 (Keep in mindthathe did this\nin the 1970s, long before it became fashionable.)To reinforcethe idea\nthat Kimberly-Clarkshould begin thinking of itselfas a consutner com\npany, not a papercompany,he unpluggedKimberlyfrom all paper indus\ntrytrade associations.67\nThe good-to-greatcompanies institutionalizedthe discipline of \"stop\ndoing\"throughthe useofa uniquebudgetmechanism.Stop and thinkfor\na moment:What isthe purposeofbudgeting?Mostanswerthat budgeting\nexiststo decide howmuch toapportionto eachactivity,or to managecosts,\nor both.

Once they understoodtheir three circles, they rarely hedged their\nbets.

Recall Gilletteand Sensor, Nucor and the mini-mills,Kimberly-\nClark andsellingthe mills to channel all itsresourcesinto the consumer\nbusiness. They all had the guts to make huge investments,once they\nunderstoodtheirHedgehogConcept.\nThe most effective investmentstrategy is a highly undiversifiedport\nfolio when you are right.As facetiousas thatsounds,that'sessentiallythe\napproachthe good-to-greatcompaniestook. \"Being right\" means getting\nthe HedgehogConcept;\"highly undiversified\"means investingfully in\nthose things that fit squarelywithin the three circles and getting rid of\neverythingelse.\nOfcourse,the key here is the little caveat,\"When you are right.\"But\nhow do you know when you re right?

One even filed to go public\nin March of2000 with an enterprisethat consistedsolelyofan informa\ntional Web site and a business plan, nothing more.

Or so thelogic went.\nAt the high point ofthis frenzy, drugstore.comissued its challengeto\nWalgreens.Atfirst,Walgreens'stocksufferedfrom the invasionofthe dot\ncoms, losingover 40 percentofits price in the months leadingup to the\ndrugstore.compublic offering.Wrote Forbes in October 1999: \"Investors\nseem to think that theWeb race will be won by competitorswho hit the\nground running—companieslike drugstore.com,which trades at 398\ntimes revenue,ratherthanWalgreen,tradingat 1.4 times revenue.\"4Ana\nlystsdowngradedWalgreens'stock,and the pressureon Walgreensto react\nto the Internetthreatincreasedas nearly$15 billionin marketvalue evap\norated.5\nWalgreens'responsein themidstofthis frenzy?\n\"We'rea crawl,walk, run company,\"DanJorndttold Forbes in describ\ning his deliberate,methodicalapproachto the Internet.Insteadofreacting\nlike Chicken Little, Walgreensexecutivesdid somethingquite unusual\nfor the times.

Said one executive,\"Let's quietlygo about doing what\nwe need to do, and it'llbecome clear soon enough that they justpulled\nthe tail of the wrongdog.\"\nThen alittlefaster(walk),Walgreensbegantofind ways to tietheInter\nnet directlyto its sophisticatedinventory-and-distributionmodel and—\nultimately—itsconvenienceconcept.Fill your prescriptionon-line,pop\ninto your car and go to your local Walgreensdrive-through(in whatever\ncity you happen to be in at the moment), zoom past the window with\nhardly a moment'spause pickingup your bottle ofwhatever.Or have it\nshippedto you, ifthat's more convenient.There was no manic lurching\nabout,no hype, no bravado—justcalm, deliberatepursuitofunderstand\ning, followedby calm, deliberatesteps forward.\nThen, finally (run!), Walgreensbet big, launchingan Internetsite as\nsophisticatedand well designedas mostpuredot-coms.Justbeforewriting\nthis chapter,inOctober2000,we wenton-linetouse Walgreens.com.We\nfound it as easy to use and the system of delivery as reliable and well\nthoughtout as Amazon.com(the reigningchampionofe-commerceat\nthe time). Preciselyone year after the Forbes article,Walgreenshad fig\nured out how to harnessthe Internet to accelerate momentum, making it\njustthatmuch more unstoppable.Itannounced(on its Web site) a signif\nicant increasein job openings,to supportits sustainedgrowth.

But it will not become great because of\nsnazzy technology, hype, and an irrational stock market. It will only\nbecome a great company if it figures out how to apply technologyto a\ncoherentconceptthat reflectsunderstandingofthe three circles.\nTECHNOLOGY AND THE HEDGEHOG CONCEPT\nNow, you mightbe thinking:\"Butthe Internetfrenzyis justa speculative\nbubble that burst. So what? Everybodyknew that the bubble was unsus\ntainable,that it just couldn'tlast. Whatdoes that teach us aboutgood to\ngreat?\"\nTo beclear:The pointofthis chapterhas littleto dowith the specifics\nofthe Internetbubble,perse. Bubblescome andbubblesgo. It happened\nwith the railroads.It happenedwith electricity.It happenedwith radio. It\nhappened with the personal computer. It happened with the Internet.\nAnd it will happenagain with unforeseennew technologies.\nYet through all of this change, great companies have adapted and\nendured. Indeed, most of the truly great companiesof the last hundred\nyears—fromWal-MarttoWalgreens,from Procter&Gambleto Kimberly-\nClark,from MercktoAbbott—tracetheirrootsbackthroughmultiplegen\nerations of technology change, be it electricity,the television, or the\nInternet.They'veadapted before and emerged great. The best ones will\nadapt again.\nWe could have predictedthat Walgreenswould eventuallyfigure out\nthe Internet.The companyhad a historyofmaking huge investmentsin\ntechnology long before other companies in its industry became tech\nsavvy. In the early 1980s, it pioneereda massive network system called\nIntercom.The idea was simple:By linkingall Walgreensstoreselectroni\ncally and sendingcustomerdata to acentralsource,it turned every Wal-\n\f\n148 ]im Collins\ngreensoutlet in thecountryinto acustomer'slocalpharmacy.You live in\nFlorida, but you're visiting Phoenix and need a prescription refill. No\nproblem,the Phoenixstoreislinkedto the centralsystem,and it's justlike\ngoingdown to yourhometownWalgreensstore.\nThis mightseem mundane bytoday's standards.But whenWalgreens\nmade the investment in Intercom in the late 1970s, no one else in the\nindustryhad anythinglike it. Eventually,Walgreensinvestedover $400\nmillionin Intercom,including$100 millionfor its own satellitesystem.7\nTouringthe Intercomheadquarters—dubbed\"EarthStationWalgreen\"—\n\"is liketakinga trip through aNASA space center with its stunningarray\nof sophisticatedelectronicgadgetry,\"wrote a trade journal.8Walgreens'\ntechnical staffbecame skilledat maintainingevery piece of technology,\nratherthan relyingon outsidespecialists.9It didn'tstop there. Walgreens\npioneeredthe applicationof scanners,robotics,computerizedinventory\ncontrol, and advanced warehousetracking systems. The Internet is just\none more step in a continuous pattern.\nWalgreensdidn'tadoptallof this advancedtechnologyjustfor the sake\nofadvancedtechnologyorin fearfulreactiontofallingbehind.No,it used\ntechnologyasa tool to acceleratemomentumafter hittingbreakthrough,\nand tied technology directly to its Hedgehog Concept of convenient\ndrugstoresincreasingprofitper customervisit. As an interestingaside, as\ntechnology became increasinglysophisticatedin the late 1990s, Wal\ngreens' CIO (chiefinformationofficer) was a registeredpharmacistby\ntraining,nota technologyguru.10Walgreensremainedresolutelyclear:Its\nHedgehogConceptwould drive its use oftechnology,not the otherway\naround.\nThe Walgreens case reflects a general pattern. In every good-to-great\ncase, we found technologicalsophistication.However, it was never tech\nnologyperse, butthe pioneeringapplicationofcarefullyselectedtechnolo\ngies. Everygood-to-greatcompanybecamea pioneerin theapplicationof\ntechnology,but thetechnologiesthemselvesvariedgreatly.(See the table\non page 150.)\nKroger,for example,was an earlypioneerin theapplicationofbarcode\nscanners,which helped it acceleratepast A&P by linkingfrontlinepur\nchases to backroominventorymanagement.This might not sound very\nexciting(inventorymanagementis notsomethingthattendsto rivetread\ners),but thinkofit thisway: Imaginewalkingbackintothe warehouseand\ninsteadofseeingboxes of cereal and crates ofapples,you see stacks and\n\f\nGood to Great 149\nstacks of dollar bills—hundreds of thousands and millions of freshly\nminted, crisp and crinkly dollar bills just sitting there on pallets, piled\nhigh to the ceiling. That's exactly how you should think of inventory.\nEverysingle case of cannedcarrotsis not justa case of cannedcarrots,it's\ncash. And it's cash just sitting there useless, until you sell that case of\ncanned carrots.\nNow recall how Kroger systematicallyshed its dreary old and small\ngrocerystores,replacingthem with nice,big, shinysuperstores.To accom\nplish this task ultimatelyrequired more than $9 billion of investment-\ncash thatwouldsomehowhave tobe pulledoutofthe low-margingrocery\nbusiness.To put this in perspective,Kroger put more than twice its total\nannual profits into capital expenditureson average every year for thirty\nyears.11 Even more impressive,despitetakingon$5.5 billionofjunkbond\ndebt to pay a onetime $40-per-sharecash dividend plus an $8 junior\ndebenture to fight off corporate raiders in 1988, Kroger continued its\ncash-intensiverevamping throughout the 1980s and 1990s.12 Kroger\nmodernizedand turnedover all its stores,improvedthe customer'sshop\nping experience, radicallyexpandedthe varietyof productsoffered,and\npaid offbillionsofdollarsofdebt. Kroger'suse ofscanningtechnologyto\ntakehundreds of millionsofcrispand crinklydollarbillsout of the ware\nhouse and put them tobetteruse became a key elementin its abilityto\npull offitsmagic trick—pullingnot one, nottwo, but three rabbitsout of\na hat.\nGillettealso became a pioneer in the applicationof technology.But\nGillette'stechnologyacceleratorslay largely in manufacturingtechnol\nogy. Think aboutthe technologyrequiredto make billions—literallybil\nlions—oflow-cost,high-tolerancerazorblades.Whenyou andI.pickup a\nGilletterazor, we expect the blade to be perfectand we expect it to be\ninexpensiveper shave. Forexample,to createthe Sensor,Gillette invested\nover $200 millionin designanddevelopment,most ofit focusedon man\nufacturingbreakthroughs,and earnedtwenty-ninepatents.13It pioneered\nthe applicationof laser welding on a mass scale to shaving systems—a\ntechnologynormallyused for expensiveand sophisticatedproducts like\nheart pacemakers.14The whole key to Gillette'sshaving systems lay in\nmanufacturingtechnologyso unique and proprietarythat Gillette pro\ntected it the way Coca-Colaprotects its secret formula, complete with\narmed guards and securityclearances.15\n\f\n150 Jim Collins\nCompany\nAbbott\nTECHNOLOGY ACCELERATORS IN THE\nGOOD-TO-GREATCOMPANIES\nTechnology AcceleratorsLinked to Hedgehog Concept\nduring Transition Era\nPioneeredapplicationof computertechnologyto\nincreaseeconomic denominator of profitper\nemployee.Nota leader in pharmaceuticalR&D—\nleavingthat toMerck,Pfizer,and othersthat had a dif\nferent HedgehogConcept.\nCircuit City Pioneered applicationofsophisticatedpoint-of-sale\nand inventory-trackingtechnologies—linkedto the\nconcept of beingthe\"McDonald's\"of big-ticketretail\ning,able to operatea geographicallydispersedsystem\nwith greatconsistency.\nFannie Mae Pioneered applicationofsophisticatedalgorithmsand\ncomputeranalysisto moreaccuratelyassess mortgage\nrisk, therebyincreasingeconomicdenominatorofprofit\nper risk level.\"Smarter\"systemof risk analysisincreases\naccessto home mortgagesforlower-incomegroups,\nlinkingto passionfordemocratizinghome ownership.\nGillette Pioneeredapplicationofsophisticatedmanufacturing\ntechnologyformakingbillionsofhigh-toleranceprod\nucts at low cost withfantasticconsistency.Protects\nmanufacturingtechnologysecretswith the same\nfanaticismthat Coca-Colaprotectsitsformula.\nKimberly-Clark Pioneeredapplicationof manufacturing-processtech\nnology,especiallyin nonwovenmaterials,to support\ntheir passionatepursuitofproduct superiority.Sophis\nticated R&Dlabs; \"babiescrawl about with tempera\nture and humiditysensorstrailingfrom their tails.\"\nKroger Pioneeredapplicationof computer and information\ntechnologyto thecontinuousmodernizationofsuper\nstores.First toseriouslyexperiment with scanners,\nwhich it linked to the entirecash-flowcycle, thereby\nprovidingfunds forthe massivestore-revampingprocess.\n\f\nNucor\nGood to Great 151\nPioneered application of the most advanced mini-\nmill steel manufacturingtechnology.\"Shop the\nworld over\"for the most advanced technology.

The lead consultant,BillKelvie,used a four-levelrank\ning, with four beingcuttingedge and one being StoneAge. Fannie Mae\nranked only a two. So, followingthe principleof \"firstwho,\" Kelvie was\nhired tomove the companyahead.16When Kelviecame to Fannie Mae in\n1990,the companylaggedaboutten yearsbehindWall Streetin the use of\ntechnology.\nOver the nextfive years, Kelvie systematicallytook Fannie Mae from a\n2 to a 3.8 on the four-pointranking.17He and his teamcreatedover 300\ncomputer applications, including sophisticatedanalytical programs to\ncontrol the $600 billion mortgage portfolio, on-line data warehouses\ncovering60 million propertiesand streamlinedworkflows,significantly\nreducingpaperand clericaleffort.\"We movedtechnologyout ofthe back\noffice and harnessed it to transform every part of the business,\" said\nKelvie. \"We createdan expertsystem that lowers the cost of becominga\nhome owner. Lenders using our technologyreduced the loan-approval\ntime from thirtydays to thirtyminutesand loweredthe associatedcosts by\nover $1,000 per loan.\"To date, the system has saved home buyers nearly\n$4 billion.18\nNoticethat the FannieMae transitionbeganin 1981,withthe arrivalof\nDavid Maxwell, yet the company lagged behind in the application of\ntechnologyuntil the early 1990s.Yes, technologybecame ofprime impor\ntance to Fannie Mae, but after it discoveredits HedgehogConcept and\nafter it reachedbreakthrough.Technologywas a key part of what Fannie\nMae leaders called \"the second wind\" of the transformation and acted as\nan acceleratingfactor.19The same patternholdsfor Kroger,Gillette,Wal-\ngreens,and all the good-to-greatcompanies—thepioneeringapplication\nof technologyusuallycame late in thetransitionand neverat the start.\n&$^^ \\l1'-p|er^\n\f\nGood to Great 153\nuse of technology until you know which technologies are relevant\nAndwhich are those?

However, once they\nunderstand which technologiesare relevant, they become fanatical and\ncreativein theapplicationofthose technologies.\nIn the comparisoncompanies,bycontrast,wefound onlythree casesof\npioneeringin the applicationoftechnology.Those threecases—Chrysler\n(computer-aideddesign), Harris (electronicsapplied to printing), and\nRubbermaid(advancedmanufacturing)—wereall unsustainedcompar\nisons, which demonstrates that technology alone cannot create sus\ntained greatresults.Chrysler,for instance,madesuperb use ofadvanced\ncomputer-aidedand otherdesigntechnologiesbut failedto linkthosetech\nnologies to a consistentHedgehogConcept.As Chryslerstrayed outside\nthe threecirclesin the mid-1980s,from Gulfstreamjets to Maseratisports\ncars, no advanced technologyby itself could save the company from\nanothermassive downturn.Technologywithouta clear HedgehogCon\ncept, and without the discipline to stay within the three circles, cannot\nmake a company great.\n\f\n154 Jim Collins\nTHE TECHNOLOGY TRAP\nTwo incidents stand out in my mind as I write this chapter. The first is\nTime magazine'sselectionin 1999 of Albert Einsteinas \"Person of the\n20th Century.\" If you frame the person-of-the-centuryselectionaround\nthe question,How differentwould the world be today if thatperson had\nnot existed?the choice ofEinsteinissurprising,comparedto leaderslike\nChurchill, Hitler, Stalin, and Gandhi—peoplewho truly changed the\ncourseof human history,for better orworse. Physicistspoint out that the\nscientificcommunitywould have reachedan understandingof relativity\nwith or without Einstein, perhaps five years later, certainly ten, but not\nfifty.20The Nazis nevergotthe bomb, and theAllieswould have won the\nSecond World War withoutit (althoughit would have cost moreAllied\nlives).Why didTime pick Einstein?\nIn explainingtheir selection,Time editors wrote: \"It's hard to com\npare the influenceof statesmenwith that ofscientists.Nevertheless,we\ncan note that there are certain eras that were most defined by their pol\nitics,others bytheir culture, and othersbytheir scientificadvances.. . .\nSo, how will the 20th century be remembered? Yes, for democracy.\nAnd,yes, forcivil rights.Butthe 20thcentury will be friostremembered\nfor itsearthshakingadvancesin scienceand technology. . . [which] . . .\nadvanced the cause of freedom, in some ways more than any statesman\ndid. In a century that will be remembered foremostfor its science and\ntechnology. . . one person stands out as the paramount icon of our\nage ... AlbertEinstein.\"21\nIn essence, the Time editors didn't pick the person of the century so\nmuch astheypickedthe theme ofthe century—technologyand science—\nand attached the most famous person to it. Interestingly,just a few days\nbeforethe Einstein announcement,Time announced itspersonofthe year\nfor 1999.Who did itpick?Noneotherthan the posterchild ofe-commerce,\nJeff Bezos of Amazon.com—reflectingyet again our cultural obsession\nwith technology-drivenchange. Let me beclear. I neither agree nor dis\nagree with Time's choices. I simplyfind them interestingand illuminat\ning, becausetheygive usa windowintoour modernpsyche.Clearly,a key\nitem on our collectivemind istechnology,and itsimplications.\nWhich bringsme to thesecondincident.Takinga shortbreakfrom the\nrigorsofwritingthis book, I traveledto Minnesotato teachsessionsat the\nMasters Forum. The Masters Forum has held executive seminars for\nnearly fifteen years, and I was curious to know which themes appeared\n\f\nGood to Great 155\nrepeatedlyoverthose years. \"One of the consistentthemes,\" said Jim Eric-\nson andPattyGriffinJensen,programdirectors,\"istechnology,change—\nand the connection between the two.\"\n\"Why do you supposethatis?\" I asked.\n\"People don't know what they don't know,\" they said. \"And they're\nalwaysafraidthat somenewtechnologyisgoingto sneakup on themfrom\nbehind andknockthem on thehead. Theydon't understandtechnology,\nand manyfear it.All theyknow for sureisthat technologyisan important\nforce of change, and that they'd better payattention to it.\"\nGiven our culture's obsessionwith technology,and given the pioneer\ning applicationof technologyin the good-to-greatcompanies,you might\nexpectthat \"technology\"would absorb a significantportion of thediscus\nsion in our interviewswith good-to-greatexecutives.\nfc\" W4\"3^fietgui€MrSOi^prisecJto find thatfully SO.peroebtofIhegood-tt>-^'\n^gr^ie&e^\n;ojfeofthe topftvefaetorsdnthe>transi^hi-FH^dr^<^in-th&tsasra>-\ny^lfe^ t|\\e^didtm^tjontechnology,Jt^fdl^-r^lac^i^kta^ of-\n;v fourth,vyjihiarirytwo^xequtiyesofeighty^okfrinterviewedranfcingit-\nIf technologyis so vitally important,why did the good-to-greatexecu\ntivestalksolittleabout it? Certainlynot becausetheyignoredtechnology:\nThey weretechnologicallysophisticatedand vastlysuperior to their com\nparisons.Furthermore, a number ofthegood-to-greatcompanies received\nextensivemedia coverageand awards for their pioneering use of technol\nogy. Yet the executiveshardlytalkedabouttechnology.It's as if the media\narticles and the executiveswere discussingtwo totally different sets of\ncompanies!\nNucor, for example,became widely known as one of the mostaggres\nsive pioneers in the application of mini-mill steel manufacturing, with\ndozens of articles and two books that celebrated its bold investments in\ncontinuous thin slabcastingand electricarc furnaces.22Nucor became a\ncornerstone case at business schools as an example of unseating the old\norderthrough the advancedapplicationof newtechnologies.\nBut when weasked Ken Iverson,CEO of Nucor during itstransition,to\nname the top five factors in the shiftfrom good to great,where on the list\n\f\n156 Jim Collins\ndo you think he put technology?First? No. Second? No. Third? Nope.\nFourth? Not even. Fifth? Sorry, but no. \"The primaryfactors,\"said Ken\nIverson,\"were the consistencyof thecompany,and our abilityto project\nits philosophiesthroughoutthe whole organization,enabled by our lack\noflayersand bureaucracy.\"23\nStop and think about that for a moment. Here we have a consummate\ncase studyof upendingthe old orderwith newtechnology,and the CEO\nwho made it happen doesn'teven listtechnologyin the topfive factors in\nthe shiftfrom goodto great.\nThis same pattern continuedthroughoutthe Nucor interviews.Of the\nseven key executivesand board members that we interviewed,only one\npickedtechnologyasthe number onefactorin theshift,and mostfocused\non otherfactors.Afew executivesdid talk aboutNucor'sbigbetson tech\nnology somewhere in the interview,but they emphasizedother factors\neven more—gettingpeople with a farmer work ethic on the bus,getting\nthe right people in key managementpositions,the simple structure and\nlack of bureaucracy, the relentless performance culture that increases\nprofitper ton of finishedsteel. Technologywas part of the Nucor equa\ntion, but a secondarypart. One Nucor executivesummed up, \"Twenty\npercent of our success is the new technologythat we embrace.. . [but]\neightypercent of oursuccessisin the culture ofour company.\"24\nIndeed, you could have given the exact same technologyat the exact\nsame time to any number of companieswith the exact same resourcesas\nNucor—andeven still, they would have failed to deliver Nucors results.\nLike the Daytona500, the primaryvariablein winningis not the car, but\nthe driver and his team. Not that the car is unimportant, but it is sec\nondary.\nMediocrity results first and foremost from management failure, not\ntechnologicalfailure.Bethlehem Steel'sdifficultieshad less to do with the\nmini-milltechnologyand more to dowith its historyof adversariallabor\nrelations,which ultimatelyhad its roots in unenlightenedand ineffective\nmanagement.Bethlehemhad alreadybegun its long slidebefore Nucor\nand the othermini-millshad taken significantmarketshare.25In fact, by\nthe time Nucor made its technologicalbreakthroughwith continuous\nthin slab castingin 1986, Bethlehemhad alreadylost more than 80 per\ncent of itsvalue relativeto the market.This is not tosay that technology\nplayed no role in Bethlehem'sdemise; technologydid play a role, and\nultimatelya significantone. Buttechnology'srolewas asan acceleratorof\n\f\nGood to Great 157\nBethlehem's demise,notthe cause of it.Again, it's the same principle at\nwork—technologyas anaccelerator,not acause—onlyin this comparison\ncase it is operating in reverse.\n1966\nBethlehem Steel's Long Decline\nRatio of Cumulative Stock Returns to General Market,\nJune 1966 - December 2000\n1976 1986 1996 2000\nIndeed, when weexaminedthe comparisoncompanies,we did not find\na single example of a comparisoncompany's demise coming primarily\nfrom atechnologytorpedo that blewit out of thewater. R. J.Reynoldslost\nits positionas the number one tobacco company in the world not because\noftechnology,but becauseRJRmanagementthrashedabout with undisci\nplined diversificationand, later,wenton a \"let'smake managementrich at\nthe expense of the company\" buyout binge.

The UnitedStateshad the mosttechnologicallyadvanced\nfighting force the world has ever known. Super jet fighters. Helicopter\ngunships.Advancedweapons.Computers.Sophisticatedcommunications.\nMilesofhigh-techborder sensors.Indeed, the reliance on technologycre\nated a false sense of invulnerability.The Americans lacked not technol\nogy, but a simple and coherent concept for the war, on which to attach\nthat technology.It lurched back and forth across a varietyof ineffective\nstrategies,never gettingthe upper hand.\nMeanwhile, the technologically inferior North Vietnamese forces\n\f\nGood to Great 159\nadheredto asimple,coherentconcept:a guerrillawar ofattrition,aimed\nat methodicallywearingdown publicsupportfor the war at home. What\nlittle technologythe North Vietnamesedid employ, such as the AK 47\nrifle (much more reliable and easier to maintain in the field than the\ncomplicated M-16), linked directly to that simple concept. And in the\nend, asyouknow, the UnitedStates—despiteall itstechnologicalsophis\ntication—did not succeed in Vietnam. If you ever find yourselfthink\ning that technologyalone holds the key to success,then think again of\nVietnam.\nIndeed, thoughtlessreliance on technologyis a liability,not an asset.\nYes, when used right—whenlinkedto a simple,clear, and coherent con\ncept rooted in deep understanding—technologyis an essentialdriver in\nacceleratingforwardmomentum.

They talked in terms of what they\nwere tryingto create and how theywere trying to improve relativeto an\nabsolute standard of excellence.\nWhen we asked GeorgeHarveyto describehismotivationfor bringing\nchange to PitneyBowes in the 1980s, he said: \"I've always wantedto see\nPitneyBowes as a greatcompany.Let's startwith that, allright? Let's just\nstartthere.That'sa giventhat needs no justificationor explanation.We're\nnot there today. We won't be theretomorrow.There is always so much\nmore to create forgreatnessin an ever-changingworld.\"35 Or as Wayne\nSanderssummed up about theethos that came totypify the inner work\nings of Kimberly-Clark:\"We're just neversatisfied.We can bedelighted,\nbut never satisfied.\"36\nThose who built the good-to-greatcompanies weren't motivated by\nfear.

They weren'tdriven by\nfear ofwatchingothershit it bigwhiletheydidn't.Theyweren'tdrivenby\nthe fearof beinghammeredbythe competition.\n^ii^^£^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^M^^^^^^^^^^^^WW^^fe,S^^^Sr^ffim,w®Fffil^^i9^\n\f\nGood to Great 161\nNever was there a better example of this difference than during the\ntechnologybubble of the late 1990s, which happened to take place right\nsmack in the middle of the research on good to great. It served as an\nalmostperfect stage to watch thedifferencebetween great and good play\nitselfout, as the great ones respondedlike Walgreens—withcalm equa\nnimity and quiet deliberate steps forward—while the mediocre ones\nlurched about in fearful, frantic reaction.\nIndeed, the big point of this chapter is not abouttechnologyper se. No\ntechnology, no matter how amazing—notcomputers, not telecommuni\ncations, not robotics, not the Internet—can by itself ignite a shift from\ngood togreat. No technologycan make you Level 5. No technologycan\nturn the wrongpeopleinto the rightpeople.No technologycan instillthe\ndisciplineto confront brutalfacts of reality,nor can it instill unwavering\nfaith. No technologycan supplantthe need fordeepunderstandingof the\nthree circles and the translation of that understanding into a simple\nHedgehogConcept. No technologycan createa culture ofdiscipline.No\ntechnology can instill the simple inner belief that leaving unrealized\npotential on the table—letting something remain good when it can\nbecome great—isa secular sin.\nThose that staytrue to these fundamentals and maintain their balance,\neven in times of great change and disruption, will accumulate the\nmomentum that creates breakthrough momentum. Those that do not,\nthose that fall into reactionarylurching about, will spiral downward or\nremain mediocre. This is the big-picturedifference between great and\ngood, the gestaltof the wholestudy captured in the metaphor of the fly\nwheel versusthe doom loop.And it isto thatoverarchingcontrastthat we\nnow turn."

Alan Wurtzel had inherited CEO responsibility\nfrom his fatherin 1973,withthe firm closeto bankruptcy.First,he rebuilt\nhis executive team and undertook an objective look at the brutal facts of\nreality,both internaland external.In 1974,still strugglingwitha crushing\ndebt load, Wurtzel and his team began to experimentwith a warehouse\nshowroom style of retailing(large inventoriesof name brands, discount\npricing, and immediatedelivery) and built a prototypeof this model in\nRichmond,Virginia,to sell appliances.In 1976, the company began to\nexperimentwith sellingconsumerelectronicsin thewarehouseshowroom\nformat, and in 1977, it transformedthe concept into the first-everCircuit\nCity store.\nThe conceptmet with success,and the companybegan systematically\nconvertingits stereo stores into Circuit City stores. In 1982—withnine\nyears ofaccumulatedturns on theflywheel—Wurtzeland his team com\nmittedfully to the conceptof the Circuit Citysuperstore.Over the next\nfive years, as itshiftedentirelyto this concept,Circuit Citygeneratedthe\nhighest total return to shareholdersof any company on the New York\nStockExchange.3From 1982 to 1999,CircuitCitygeneratedcumulative\nstock returns twenty-twotimes better than the market, handily beating\nIntel, Wal-Mart,GE, Hewlett-Packard,and Coca-Cola.\nNot surprisingly,Circuit City then found itself a prime subject for\nmedia attention. Whereas we found noarticlesof anysignificancein the\ndecade leading up the transition,we found ninety-sevenarticles'worth\nexaminingin the decade after the transition,twenty-twoof themsignifi\ncantpieces.It's as ifthe companyhadn'teven existedpriortothat,despite\nhaving traded on a major stock exchange since 1968, and despite the\nremarkableprogressmade by Wurtzelandhis team in thedecadeleading\nup to the breakthroughpoint.\nThe Circuit City experiencereflectsa common pattern.

In every good-to-greatcompany, at least\none ofthe intervieweesgave an unpromptedadmonishment,sayingsome\nthingalongthe linesof, \"Look,you can't dissectthis thing into aseriesof\nnice little boxes and factors,or identifythe moment of'Aha!' or the 'one\nbigthing.'It was a wholebunch ofinterlockingpiecesthatbuiltone upon\nanother.\"\nEven in the most dramatic case in our study—Kimberly-Clarkselling\nthe mills—theexecutivesdescribedan organic,cumulativeprocess.\"Dar\nwin did not change the directionof the company overnight,\"said one\nKimberly-Clarkexecutive. \"He evolved it over time.\"6 \"The transition\nwasn'tlike nightand day,\" said another.\"Itwas gradual,and I don't think\n\f\nGood to Great 169\nitwas entirelyclearto everybodyuntila few years intoit.\"7Ofcourse,selling\nthe mills was a giganticpush on the flywheel,but it was only one push.\nAfterselling the mills,the full transformationinto the number one paper-\nbased consumer products company required thousands of additional\npushes on the flywheel, big and small, accumulated one on top of\nanother.

Rather, it was a\nquiet, deliberate processof figuringout what needed to be done to create\nthe best future results and then simply taking those steps, one after the\nother, turn by turn of the flywheel.

Most basketballfans know that the\nBruins won ten NCAA Championships in twelve years, at one point\nassemblinga sixty-one-gamewinningstreak, under the legendarycoach\nJohn Wooden.21\nBut do you know how manyyears Wooden coached the Bruins before\nhis first NCAA Championship? Fifteen. From 1948 to 1963, Wooden\nworked in relative obscurity before winning his first championship in\n1964.Year byyear, Coach Wooden built theunderlyingfoundations,de-\n\f\n172 Jim Collins\nvelopinga recruiting system,implementinga consistentphilosophy,and\nrefiningthe full-court-pressstyle ofplay. No one paid too much attention\nto the quiet, soft-spokencoach and his team until—wham!—they hit\nbreakthrough and systematicallycrushed every serious competitor for\nmore than a decade.\nLike the Wooden dynasty, lasting transformationsfrom good to great\nfollow a general pattern of buildup followed by breakthrough. In some\ncases,the buildup-to-breakthroughstage takes a long time, in other cases,\na shorter time. At Circuit City, the buildup stage lasted nine years, at\nNucor ten years,whereas at Gillette it took onlyfive years,at Fannie Mae\nonlythree years,and at PitneyBowesabout twoyears. But, no matter how\nshort or long ittook, everygood-to-greattransformationfollowedthe same\nbasic pattern—accumulatingmomentum, turn by turn of the flywheel—\nuntil buildup transformedinto breakthrough.\nNOT JUST A LUXURY OF CIRCUMSTANCE\nIt's important to understand that following the buildup-breakthrough\nflywheel model is not just a luxury of circumstance. People who say,\n\"Hey, but we've got constraintsthat prevent us from taking this longer-\nterm approach,\" should keep in mind that the good-to-greatcompanies\nfollowed this model no matter how dire the short-term circumstances—\nderegulation in the case of Wells Fargo, looming bankruptcy in the\ncases of Nucor and Circuit City, potential takeover threats in the cases\nof Gillette and Kroger, or million-dollar-a-daylosses in the case of Fan\nnie Mae.\nThis alsoappliesto managingthe short-termpressuresofWallStreet.\"I\njustdon't agreewith thosewho say youcan't build an enduring great com\npany because Wall Street won't let you,\" said DavidMaxwell of Fannie\nMae. \"We communicated with analysts,to educate them on what we were\ndoing and where we weregoing. At first, a lot of people didn't buy into\nthat—youjusthaveto acceptthat. Butonce wegotthrough the dark days,\nwe respondedby doingbetter everysingleyear. Aftera few years,because\nof our actual results, we became a hot stockand never lookedback.\"22And\na hot stock it was. During Maxwell's first two years, the stock lagged\nbehind the market, but then it took off. From the end of 1984 to the year\n2000, $1 investedin Fannie Mae multipliedsixty-fourtimes, beating the\n\f\nGood to Great 173\ngeneral market—including the wildly inflated NASDAQ of the late\n1990s—bynearlysixtimes.\n/ The, goo^to-greatcompanies,were subjectto thesame short-term\npressuresfrom Wad Stomas thefprnpatri^ncompanies.Yet, unlike\nthe bdrhparisqncompanresfthey;had;thepatienceand disciplineto\nfollowthebuildup-breakthrough1flywheel model despite'these pres-\n-y gupes. And in the end, they attained extraordinaryresults by Wall\n'. Street's own measure of,success./\nThe key, we learned,is to harnessthe flywheelto manage these short-\nterm pressures.One particularlyelegantmethodfor doing so came from\nAbbott Laboratories,using a mechanismit called the Blue Plans. Each\nyear, Abbottwould tell Wall Streetanalyststhat it expectedtogrow earn\nings a specifiedamount—say,15 percent.At the same time, itwould set\nan internalgoal ofa muchhighergrowthrate—say,25 percent,oreven 30\npercent.Meanwhile,itkept a rank-orderedlist ofproposedentrepreneur\nial projects that had not yet been funded—theBlue Plans. Toward the\nend oftheyear,Abbottwould picka numberthatexceededanalystexpec\ntationsbut thatfell shortofits actualgrowth.It would then take the differ\nence between the \"make the analysts happy\" growth and the actual\ngrowth and channel those funds into the Blue Plans. It was a brilliant\nmechanismfor managingshort-termpressureswhilesystematicallyinvest\ning in thefuture.23\nWe found no evidenceofanythinglike the Blue PlansatAbbott'scom\nparison company.Instead,Upjohn executiveswould pump up the stock\nwith a sales job (\"Buy into our future\"), reverentlyintoningthe phrase\n\"investingfor the long-term,\" especially when the company failed to\ndeliver current results.24 Upjohn continuallythrew money after hare\nbrainedprojectslike its Rogainebaldnesscure, attemptingto circumvent\nbuildupand jump right to breakthroughwith a big hit. Indeed, Upjohn\nremindedus ofa gambler,puttinga lot ofchips on red at Las Vegas and\nsaying, \"See, we're investingfor the future.\" Of course, when the future\narrived,the promisedresultsrarelyappeared.\nNot surprisingly,Abbottbecamea consistentperformerand a favorite\nholding on Wall Street, while Upjohn became a consistentdisappoint-\n\f\n174 Jim Collins\nment. From 1959 to Abbott's point of breakthrough in 1974, the two\nstocks roughlytrackedeach other.Then theydramaticallydiverged,with\nUpjohnfallingmore than six times behindAbbottbeforebeingacquired\nin 1995.\n$300\n$200\n$100\n1959\nAbbott versus Upjohn\nCumulative Value of $1 Invested,\n1959-1995\n1974\nAbbott:$271\nUpjohn:$40\n1989 1995\nLike Fannie Mae and Abbott, all the good-to-greatcompanieseffec\ntively managedWall Streetduringtheirbuildup-breakthroughyears, and\ntheysaw no contradictionbetweenthetwo. Theysimplyfocusedon accu\nmulatingresults, often practicingthe time-honoreddisciplineof under-\npromisingandoverdelivering.And as theresultsbegantoaccumulate—as\nthe flywheel built momentum—theinvesting communitycame along\nwith greatenthusiasm.\nTHE \"FLYWHEEL EFFECT\"\nThe good-to-greatcompanies understood a simple truth: Tremendous\npower exists in the fact of continuedimprovementand the delivery of\nresults.Pointtotangibleaccomplishments—howeverincrementalatfirst—\nand show how these steps fit into thecontextof an overall concept that\nwill work.

Rather, they began to spin the flywheel—understandingto\naction,step afterstep, turn afterturn. After the flywheelbuilt up momen\ntum, they'd look up andsay, \"Hey, ifwe just keep pushingon this thing,\nthere's noreasonwe can'taccomplishX.\"\nFor example,Nucorbeganturningtheflywheelin 1965,at first justtry\ning toavoid bankruptcy,then later buildingits first steel mills becauseit\ncould notfind a reliablesupplier.Nucorpeoplediscoveredthatthey had\na knackfor makingsteelbetterandcheaperthananyoneelse,so theybuilt\ntwo, and then three, additionalmini-mills.They gained customers,then\nmore customers, then more customers—whoosh!—theflywheel built\nmomentum, turn by turn, month bymonth, year by year. Then, around\n1975, itdawnedon theNucorpeoplethatifthey justkept pushingon the\nflywheel,they could becomethe numberone, most profitablesteel com\npany in America.ExplainedMarvin Pohlman:\"I remembertalkingwith\nKen Iverson in 1975, and he said, 'Marv, I think we can become the num\nber one steel companyin the U.S.' 1975!

Three years later, his successor, Joe Williams, extracted\nWarner-Lambertfrom the hospitalsupply businessand took a $550 mil\nlionwrite-off.33He tried to focus the companyon beatingMerck,but his\nsuccessorthrewthe companybacktodiversificationand consumergoods.\nAnd soit went,backand forth,lurchand thrash,with eachCEO tryingto\nmakea markwith his ownprogram.\nFrom 1979 through 1998, Warner-Lambert underwent three major\nrestructurings—oneper CEO—hacking away 20,000 people in search of\nquickbreakthroughresults.Time andagain, the companywould attaina\nburstof results,then slacken,neverattainingthe sustainedmomentum of\na buildup-breakthroughflywheel. Stock returns flattened relative to the\nmarket and Warner-Lambertdisappearedas an independent company,\nswallowedup by Pfizer.34\n\f\n180 Jim Collins\nThe Warner-Lambert case is extreme, but we found some version of the\ndoom loop in every comparisoncompany. (SeeAppendix8.A for a sum\nmary.) While the specific permutations of the doom loop varied from\ncompany to company, there were some highly prevalent patterns, two of\nwhich deserveparticularnote: the misguideduse ofacquisitionsand the\nselectionofleaderswho undid thework ofpreviousgenerations.\nThe Misguided Use of Acquisitions\nPeter Drucker once observedthat the drive for mergers and acquisitions\ncomesless from sound reasoningand morefrom the fact that doingdeals\nis a much moreexcitingway to spend your day than doing actualwork.35\nIndeed, the comparisoncompanieswould havewell understoodthe pop\nular bumper stickerfrom the 1980s, \"When the going gets tough, we go\nshopping!\"\nTo understand the role ofacquisitionsin the processofgoingfromgood\nto great, we undertook asystematicqualitativeand quantitativeanalysisof\nall acquisitionsand divestituresin all the companies in our study, from\nten years before the transitiondate through 1998. While we noticed no\nparticular pattern in the amount or scaleofacquisitions,we didnote a sig\nnificant difference in the success rate of the acquisitions in the good-to-\ngreat companiesversusthe comparisons.(SeeAppendix8.B.)\n*Why;didthe goQ^^^\nces^rate-#^^^\n. theirsuccesssms:thaMheirbi|j•gcgui^lioA^ener^lytpqfeplfte^ftef'\n-A dWelbpm^rit'ofihe: l^bg^hp^f6Srt^pt'aiE^l^$'^9iE:^Hc^'^wh^i'hacfe;\n^bujltsicjnificsintmornenttum,lft%j}^6^<^^ aps$s*&ri&cbelemtQP>\nIn contrast,the comparisoncompaniesfrequentlytried to jump right to\nbreakthrough via an acquisition or merger. It never worked. Often with\ntheir core business under siege, the comparison companies would dive\ninto a big acquisitionasaway to increasegrowth,diversifyawaytheir trou\nbles, or make a CEO lookgood. Yet they neveraddressedthe fundamen\ntal question: \"What can we do better than any other company in the\n\f\nGood to Great 181\nworld,that fits our economic denominator and that we have passionfor?\"\nThey never learned the simple truth that, while you can buy yourway to\ngrowth,you absolutelycannot buy yourway to greatness.Two big medi\nocritiesjoinedtogethernevermakeone great company.\nLeaders Who Stop the Flywheel\nThe other frequently observeddoom loop pattern is that of new leaders\nwho stepped in, stopped an already spinning flywheel,and threw it in\nan entirely new direction. ConsiderHarrisCorporation, which applied\nmany of thegood-to-greatconcepts in the early1960s and began a clas\nsic buildup processthat led tobreakthroughresults.George Divelyand\nhis successor,Richard Tullis,identifieda HedgehogConcept, based on\nthe understandingthat Harriscould be the bestin theworld at applying\ntechnology to printing and communications. Although it did not\nadhere to this concept with perfect discipline (Tullis had a penchant\nfor straying a bit outside the three circles), the company did make\nenough progressto produce significantresults.It looked like a promis\ning candidate for a good-to-greattransformation,hitting breakthrough\nin 1975.\nThen the flywheelcameto a grindinghalt.\nIn 1978,JosephBoyd becamechief executive.Boyd had previouslybeen\nwith Radiation,Inc.,a corporationacquiredbyHarrisyearsearlier.His first\nkey decisionas CEO was to move the companyheadquartersfrom Cleve\nland to Melbourne, Florida—Radiation's hometown, and the location of\nBoyd'shouseand forty-seven-footpowerboat,the Lazy Rascal}6\nIn 1983, Boyd threw a giantwrench into the flywheelby divestingthe\nprinting business.At the time, Harris was the number one producer of\nprinting equipment in the world. The printing businesswas one of the\nmost profitableparts of the company, generatingnearly a third of total\noperatingprofits.37What did Boyd do with the proceedsfrom sellingoff\nthis corporate gem? He threw the company headlong into the office\nautomation business.\nBut could Harris become the best in the world in office automation?\nNot likely. \"Horrendous\"software-developmentproblemsdelayed intro\nduction ofHarris'first workstationasthe companystumbledonto the bat\ntlefieldto confrontIBM, DEC, andWang.38Then, in anattemptto jump\nrightto a newbreakthrough,Harrisspenta thirdofits entirecorporatenet"

    "raw_text": "190 Jim Collins\n1.When I consider the enduring great companies from Built to Last,\nI now see substantial evidence that their early leaders followed the\ngood-to-greatframework.The onlyreal differenceis that they did so as\nentrepreneurs in small, early-stage enterprises trying to get off the\nground,ratherthan asCEOs tryingto transformestablishedcompanies\nfrom good togreat.\n2. In an ironic twist, I now see Good to Great not as a sequel to Built to\nLast, but asa prequel.Applythe findingsin thisbookto createsustained\ngreatresults,asa start-upor anestablishedorganization,and then apply\nthe findingsin Builtto Lasttogo from greatresultsto an enduringgreat\ncompany.\nEstablished Good to Sustained Builtto Enduring\nCompany + Great -» Great + Last —> Great\norStart-up Concepts Results Concepts Company\n3.To make the shift from a companywith sustainedgreat results to an\nenduring great company of iconic stature, apply the central concept\nfrom BuilttoLast: Discoveryour corevaluesand purpose beyond just\nmaking money (coreideology)and combine this with the dynamic of\npreservethe core/stimulateprogress.\n4. A tremendous resonance existsbetween the two studies; the ideas from\neach enrich and inform the ideas in the other. In particular, Good to\nGreat answers a fundamental question raised, but not answered, in\nBuilt to Last: What is the differencebetween a \"good\" BHAG (Big\nHairyAudacious Goal) and a \"bad\" BHAG?\nGOOD TO GREAT IN THE EARLY STAGES\nOF BU I LT TO LAST\nLookingbackon the BuilttoLaststudy,it appearsthat the enduring great\ncompaniesdid in fact go through a process of buildup to breakthrough,\nfollowingthe good-to-greatframeworkduring theirformativeyears.\nConsider, for example, the buildup-breakthroughflywheel pattern in\nthe evolution of Wal-Mart. Most people think that Sam Walton just\nexploded onto the scene with his visionaryidea for rural discount retail\ning, hittingbreakthroughalmostasa start-upcompany.But nothing could\nbe further from the truth.\n\f\nGood to Great 191\nSamWaltonbeganin 1945 with a singledimestore.He didn't open his\nsecond store until seven years later. Walton built incrementally, step by\nstep, turn by turn of the flywheel, until the HedgehogConcept of large\ndiscount marts popped out as a natural evolutionarystep in the mid-\n1960s. It tookWaltona quarterofa centuryto grow from that singledime\nstore to a chain of 38 Wal-Marts. Then, from 1970 to 2000, Wal-Mart hit\nbreakthroughmomentum and exploded to over 3,000 stores with over\n$150 billion (yes, billion) in revenues.2Just like thestory of the chicken\njumpingout of the egg that we discussedin the flywheel chapter,Wal-\nMart had been incubatingfor decades before the egg cracked open. As\nSam Walton himself wrote:\nSomehow over the years people have gotten the impressionthat Wal-\nMart was . . . just this great idea that turned into anovernightsuccess.\nBut... it was an outgrowth of everything we'd been doing since\n[1945]... . And like mostovernightsuccesses,it was about twentyyears\nin the making.3\nIf there everwas a classiccase of buildup leading to aHedgehogCon\ncept, followedby breakthroughmomentum in the flywheel,Wal-Martis\nit. The only difference is that Sam Walton followed the model as an\nentrepreneurbuildinga great companyfrom the ground up, rather than\nas a CEO transformingan establishedcompanyfrom good to great. But\nit's the same basic idea.4\nHewlett-Packardprovides another excellent example of the good-to-\ngreat ideas at work in the formativestagesofa BuilttoLast company.For\ninstance, Bill Hewlett and David Packard'sentire founding concept for\nHP was not what, but who—startingwith each other. They'd been best\nfriends in graduate school and simply wanted to build a great company\ntogetherthat wouldattractother peoplewith similarvaluesand standards.\nThe founding minutes oftheirfirst meetingon August23, 1937,begin by\nstatingthat they woulddesign,manufacture,and sellproductsin the elec\ntricalengineering fields,very broadlydefined.But then thosesame found\ning minutes go on to say, \"The question of what to manufacture was\npostponed.. . .\"5\nHewlett and Packard stumbled around for months trying to come up\nwith something,anything,that would get the companyout of the garage.\nThey consideredyacht transmitters,air-conditioningcontrol devices,med\nical devices, phonograph amplifiers,you name it. They built electronic\n\f\n192 Jim Collins\nBuildup-Breakthrough Flywheel at Wal-Mart\nNumber of Stores 1945,1970, 1990, 2000\n2000: 3,151 Stores.,\n3,000\n2,000\n1990:1,528 Stores\n1,000\n1945:1 Store 1970:38 Stores\n0-= \"\nBuildup...

Recall Packard'sLaw, which we citedin chapter3: \"No com\npany can grow revenuesconsistentlyfasterthan its abilityto getenoughof\nthe right people to implementthat growth and still become a great com\npany.\"Hewlettand Packardlived andbreathedthis conceptand obtained\na surplusofgreatpeoplewhenevertheopportunitypresenteditself.\nHewlett and Packard were themselvesconsummate Level 5 leaders,\nfirst as entrepreneursand later ascompanybuilders.Years after HP had\nestablisheditselfas one of themost importanttechnologycompaniesin\nthe world, Hewlettmaintaineda remarkablepersonalhumility.In 1972,\nHP vice president Barney Oliver wrote in a recommendation letter to the\nIEEE Awards Board for the Founders Award:\n\f\nGood to Great 193\nWhile our success has been gratifying,it has not spoiled our founders.\nOnly recently, at an executive council meeting, Hewlett remarked:\n\"Look, weVe grown because the industrygrew. We were lucky enough\nto be sitting on the nose when the rocket took off. We don't deserve a\ndamn bit of credit.\" After a moment's silence, while everyonedigested\nthis humbling comment, Packard said: \"Well, Bill, at least we didn't\nlouse it upcompletely.\"7\nShortlybefore his death, I had theopportunityto meet Dave Packard.\nDespite being one of Silicon Valley'sfirst self-madebillionaires, he lived\nin the same small house that he and his wife built for themselves in 1957,\noverlookinga simple orchard.The tiny kitchen, with its dated linoleum,\nand the simply furnished living room bespoke a man who needed no\nmaterial symbols to proclaim \"I'm a billionaire. I'm important. I'm suc\ncessful.\" \"His idea of a good time,\" said Bill Terry, who worked with\nPackard for thirty-sixyears, \"was to get some of his friends together to\nstringsome barbedwire/'8Packardbequeathedhis$5.6 billionestateto a\ncharitablefoundationand, upon his death, his family created a eulogy\npamphlet, witha photo ofhim sittingon a tractorin farmingclothes.The\ncaption made no reference to his stature as one of the greatindustrialists\nof the twentieth century.9 It simply read: \"David Packard, 1912-1996,\nRancher, etc.\" Level 5, indeed.\nCORE IDEOLOGY: THE EXTRA DIMENSION OF\nENDURING GREATNESS\nDuring our interview with Bill Hewlett, we asked him what he was most\nproud of in his long career. \"As I look back on my life's work,\" he said,\n\"I'm probably most proud of having helped create a company that by\nvirtue of itsvalues,practices,and successhas had a tremendous impact on\nthe way companiesare managedaround the world.\"10The \"HP Way,\" as\nit became known, reflected a deeply held set of core values that distin\nguished the company more than any of its products. These values\nincluded technical contribution, respectfor the individual,responsibility\nto the communities in which the company operates,and a deeply held\nbeliefthat profitisnotthe fundamentalgoal of acompany.These princi\nples,while fairlystandardtoday,were radicaland progressivein the 1950s.\nDavid Packard said of businessmen from those days, \"While they were\n\f\n194 Jim Collins\nreasonablypolite in their disagreement,it was quite evident that they\nfirmly believedthat Iwas not one ofthem, and obviouslynot qualifiedto\nmanagean importantenterprise.\"11\nHewlett and Packard exemplifya key \"extra dimension\" that helped\nelevatetheir companyto the elitestatusof an enduringgreatcompany,a\nvital dimension for making the transitionfrom good to great to built to\nlast. That extra dimensionis a guidingphilosophyor a \"core ideology,\"\nwhich consistsofcore valuesand acore purpose(reasonfor beingbeyond\njust makingmoney).These resemblethe principles in the Declaration of\nIndependence (\"We hold these truths to be self-evident\")—neverper\nfectlyfollowed,but alwayspresentasan inspiringstandardand ananswer\nto the question ofwhy it is importantthat weexist.\nessential torlife, bu^'*•><*- rV ?*\"<\" ..'\" J?1- *i*^^r\"^^*<!^?^.^*,**n«JS>T5^vy;'5jfef^\"^g\"^^i;\nWewrote in Builtto LastaboutMerck'sdecisionto developand distrib\nute a drug that cured river blindness.This painful diseaseafflictedovera\nmillionpeoplewith parasiticworms thatswarm throughthe eyes to cause\nblindness.Because those who had the disease—tribalpeople in remote\nplaceslikethe Amazon—hadno money,Merckinitiatedthe creationofan\nindependentdistributionsystemtogetthe drugtoremotevillagesandgave\nthe drugaway free to millionsofpeoplearoundthe world.12\nTo be clear, Merck is not acharityorganization,nor does it view itself\nas such. Indeed, it has consistentlyoutperformedthe marketas a highly\nprofitablecompany,growingtonearly$6billionin profitsandbeatingthe\nmarket by over ten timesfrom 1946 to 2000. Yet, despite its remarkable\nfinancialperformance,Merck does not view its ultimatereasonfor being\nasmakingmoney.In 1950,GeorgeMerck2d,sonofthe founder,setforth\nhis company'sphilosophy:\nWe try to remember that medicine is for thepatient.... It is not for the\npiofits. The profitsfollow, and if we have remembered that, they have\nnever failed to appear. The better we have rememberedit, the larger\nthey havebeen.13\n\f\nGood to Great 195\nAn important caveat to the concept of core values is that there are no\nspecific \"right\" core values for becoming an enduring great company.\nNo matter what core value you propose, we found an enduring great\ncompany that does not have that specific core value. A company need\nnot have passion for its customers (Sonydidn't), or respect for the indi\nvidual (Disney didn't), or quality (Wal-Martdidn't), or social responsi\nbility (Ford didn't) in order to become enduring and great. This was\none of the mostparadoxicalfindingsfrom Builtto Last—corevaluesare\nessentialfor enduringgreatness,but it doesntseem to matterwhatthose\ncore valuesare. The point is not what core values you have, butthatyou\nhave core values at all, that you know what they are, that you build\nthem explicitlyinto the organization,and that you preserve them over\ntime.\nThis notion of preservingyour core ideology is a central feature of\nenduring greatcompanies.The obviousquestionis,Howdo you preserve\nthe coreand yetadaptto a changingworld?The answer:Embracethe key\nconceptof preservethe core/stimulateprogress.\n\\fyEnsuringgqeaj ebmpanres.preserve their core values and purpose\n^r^hMifr_tti^frv&vf§|n^s''strate^fa^.and operating practices endlessly\n:--adftptto a changingWorld This is litemdgidal combinationof apre-\n^;sj#jye^hereoreOT^\nThe storyofWalt Disneyexemplifiesthis duality.In 1923,an energetic\ntwenty-one-year-oldanimatormovedfrom KansasCityto Los Angelesand\ntriedto geta jobin the moviebusiness.No film companywouldhire him,\nso he used his meager savings to rent a camera, set up a studio in his\nuncle'sgarage,and beginmakinganimatedcartoons.In 1934,Mr. Disney\ntook the boldstep, neverbeforetaken,to createsuccessfulfull-lengthani\nmated feature films, including Snow White, Pinocchio, Fantasia, and\nBambi. In the 1950s, Disney moved into television with the Mickey\nMouse Club. Also in the 1950s,Walt Disneypaid a fatefulvisitto a num\nber of amusementparks and came away disgusted,callingthem \"dirty,\nphony places, run by tough-lookingpeople.\"14He decided that Disney\ncould build something much better, perhaps even the best in the world,\nand the company launched a whole new business in theme parks, first\nwith Disneylandand later with WaltDisneyWorld and EPCOT Center.\n\f\n196 Jim Collins\nOver time, Disneytheme parkshavebecome a cornerstone experience for\nmany familiesfrom all overthe world.\nThroughout all these dramatic changes—fromcartoons to full-length\nfeature animation, from the Mickey Mouse Club to Disney World-—the\ncompanyheld firmly to a consistentset of corevalues that included pas\nsionate belief in creative imagination,fanatic attention to detail, abhor\nrence of cynicism, and preservationof the \"Disney Magic.\" Mr. Disney\nalsoinstilleda remarkable constancyofpurposethat permeated everynew\nDisney venture—namely,to bring happinessto millions, especiallychil\ndren. This purpose cut across national bordersand has endured through\ntime. When my wife and I visited Israel in 1995, we met the man who\nbroughtDisney productsto the MiddleEast. \"The wholeidea,\"he told us\nwith pride, \"is to bring a smile to a child'sface. That's really important\nhere, wherethere aren't enoughsmileson the children.\"WaltDisneypro\nvides a classiccase ofpreservethe core andstimulateprogress,holding a\ncore ideologyfixed while changingstrategiesand practicesovertime, and\nits adherence to this principle is the fundamental reason why it has\nendured as a great company.\n\f\nPRESERVE\nPassion for creative ima '\nFanatic attention to detail\nAbhorrence of cynicism\nThe \"Disney Magic\"\nBring happiness to millions\nGood to Great 197\nCHANGE\n1920s: Cartoons\n1930s: Full-length feature animation\n1950s: Television, Mickey Mouse Cluby\n1960s: Theme parks\n1980s: International\n1990s: Cruise Line\nPreservethe Core/StimulateProgressatWalt DisneyCompany,\n1920s-1990s\nGOOD BHAGS, BAD BHAGS, AND OTHER\nCONCEPTUAL LINKS\nIn the table on page 198, IVe outlined a sketch of conceptual links\nbetween the two studies.

In\nBuilt to Last, we identified BHAGs as a key way to stimulate progress\nwhile preservingthe core.A BHAG (pronouncedbee-hag,short for \"Big\nHairyAudaciousGoal\") is a huge and dauntinggoal—likea big moun\ntain to climb. It is clear, compelling,and people \"get it\" right away. A\nBHAG serves as a unifyingfocal point ofeffort,galvanizingpeople and\ncreating team spiritas peoplestrive toward a finish line. Like the 1960s\nNASA moon mission, a BHAG captures the imagination and grabs peo\nple in the gut.\nHowever, as exciting as BHAGs are, we left a vital question unan\nswered. What is thedifferencebetweena bad BHAG and a goodBHAG?\nSwimmingfrom Australiato New Zealandwould be a BHAGforme, but\nit would also kill me! We can nowofferan answerto that question, draw\ning directlyfrom the studyofgood-to-greatcompanies.\nAsuperbexampleofthis comesfrom Boeingin the1950s.Untilthe early\n1950s,Boeingfocusedon buildinghuge flyingmachinesfor the military—\nthe B-17 FlyingFortress,the B-29 Superfortress,and theB-52 intercontinen\ntal jetbomberStratofortress.15However,Boeinghadvirtuallyno presencein\nthe commercial aircraftmarket,and the airlinesshowedno interest in buy\ning aircraftfrom Boeing. (\"You make great bombers up there in Seattle.\nWhy don't you just stick with that,\" they said in response to Boeing's\ninquiries.)Today,we take for grantedthatmostairtraveltakesplaceon Boe\ning jets,butin 1952,almostno one outsidethe militaryflew onBoeing.16\nWisely,throughthe 1940s, Boeinghad stayedaway from the commer\ncial sphere, an arena in which McDonnellDouglas had vastly superior\nabilities in the smaller, propeller-drivenplanes that composed the com\nmercialfleet.17In the early 1950s,however,Boeingsaw an opportunityto\nleapfrogMcDonnell Douglas by marryingits experiencewith large air-"

Ultimately,the consistentapplicationofboth studies,one building\nupon the other,givesthebestchancefor creatinggreatnessthatlasts.\nWHY GREATN ESS?\nDuringa breakat aseminarthatI gave to agroup ofmy ex-studentsfrom\nStanford,one came up to me,brow furrowed.\"MaybePm justnot ambi\ntious enough,\"he said. \"ButI don'treallywantto builda hugecompany.\nIs there something wrongwith that?\"\n\"Notat all,\" I replied.\"Greatnessdoesn'tdependon size.\"I then toldhim\n\f\nGood to Great 205\naboutSina Simantob,who runs the buildingwhere I have my researchlab\noratory.Sina has createda truly great institution.It's an old 1892 redbrick\nschoolbuildingthat has been renovatedinto the most extraordinaryspace,\ndecoratedand maintainedwith tremendousattentionto detail, bordering\non perfection.By one definitionofresults—attractingthe most interesting\npeople in Boulder,settinga standard that other local buildingsmeasure\nthemselvesagainst,and generatingthe highestprofitper foot ofspace—his\nsmall enterpriseis trulya greatinstitutionin my hometown.Simantobhas\nneverdefinedgreatnessbysize, and there isnoreasonforhim to.\nThe studentpausedfor amoment,then said: \"Okay,IacceptthatIdon't\nneed to buildabigcompanyinorderto haveagreatcompany.Butevenso,\nwhy should I try to build a great company?What ifI just want to besuc\ncessful?\"\nThe questionbroughtme up short.

Itmightbe statisticallymore rare to reach greatness,but\nitdoes not requiremoresufferingthan perpetuatingmediocrity.Indeed,if\nsome of the comparisoncompaniesin our study are any indication,it\ninvolvesless suffering,and perhapseven less work. The beautyand power\nofthe researchfindings is that they can radicallysimplifyour lives while\nincreasingour effectiveness.There is great solace in the simple fact of\nclarity—aboutwhat isvital,and what is not.\n%#ed,:i^^^^ potthat we shouldttaddH these\n^;#[yfp|s^ anftm^keourselvesevenmore\n!t6^%^ resizethat mucivofwhat we'redoing\n^i|ff^^ majority*ofour work;\n^lirr^ apd pr&tiy much ignored,or\nO^^fe^^^Sf %^^tfl!,10^^?^,Q^ liv^would be simpler and. our\n\f\n206 Jim Collins\nLetme illustratethis pointwith a nonbusinessexample,thelaststoryof\nthe book. The coachingstaffofa high schoolcross-countryrunning team\nrecently got togetherfor dinner after winning its second state champi\nonship in two years. The programhad been transformedin the previous\nfive years from good (top twenty in the state) to great (consistentcon\ntendersfor the state championship,onboth the boys' andgirls'teams).\n\"Idon'tget it,\" said one ofthe coaches.\"Whyare we so successful?We\ndon'twork any harderthan otherteams.And whatwe dois justso simple.\nWhydoes it work?\"\nHe was referringtothe HedgehogConceptofthe program,capturedin\nthe simplestatement:We run best atthe end. We run best at theend of\nworkouts. We run best at the end of races. And we run best at the end of\nthe season, when it counts the most. Everythingis geared to this simple\nidea,and thecoachingstaffknows how tocreatethis effectbetterthanany\nother team in the state. For example, they place a coach at the 2-mile\nmark (ofa 3.1-milerace) to collectdata as the runnersgo past. Butunlike\nmost teams, which collect time splits (minutes-per-milerunning pace),\nthis team collectsplacesplits(whatplacetherunnersare inas theygo by).\nThen the coaches calculate not how fast the runners go, but how many\ncompetitorsthey pass atthe end ofthe race, from mile 2to the finish.They\nthen use this data to award \"head bones\" after each race. (Head bones are\nbeadsin theshapeofshrunkenskulls,whichthekids make into necklaces\nand bracelets,symbolizingtheirvanquishedcompetitors.)The kids learn\nhow to pace themselves,and race with confidence:\"We run best at the\nend,\"theythinkattheendofa hard race. \"So, ifI'm hurtingbad, thenmy\ncompetitorsmusthurt a wholelotworse!\"\nOfequal importanceis what they don'twaste energyon. For example,\nwhen the head coach took over the program,she found herselfburdened\nwith expectationsto do \"funprograms\"and \"rah-rahstuff\"to motivatethe\nkids and keep them interested—parties,and special trips, and shopping\nadventuresto Nike outlets,and inspirationalspeeches.Shequicklyput an\nend to nearly all that distracting(and time-consuming)activity.\"Look,\"\nshe said,\"thisprogramwill bebuiltonthe idea thatrunningis fun, racing\nis fun, improvingis fun, and winningis fun. Ifyou'renotpassionateabout\nwhat we do here, then go find somethingelse to do.\" The result: The\nnumberofkids in the programnearlytripledin five years, from thirtyto\neighty-two.\nBefore the boys' team won the first-everstate cross-countrychampi\nonship in the school'shistory,she didn't explicitlyset thegoal or try to\n\f\nGood to Great 207\n\"motivate\"the kids toward it. Instead,she let the kids gain momentum,\nseeingfor themselves—raceby race, week by week—thatthey could beat\nanyone in the state. Then, one day out ona trainingrun, one boy said to\nhis teammates,\"Hey, I think we could win state.\"\"Yeah, I thinkso, too,\"\nsaid another. Everyone kept running, the goal quietly understood.The\ncoachingstaffnever once mentionedthe state championshipidea until\nthekids saw for themselvesthatthey coulddoit.\nThis created the strongestculture ofdisciplinepossible,as the seven\nvarsity runners felt personallyresponsiblefor winning state—a commit\nment made not to the coaches, buttoeach other. One team member even\ncalled all ofhis teammatesthe night before the state race, just to make\nsure they were all gettingreadyfor bed early. (No need for the coachesto\nbe disciplinarianson this team.) Hammeringthroughthe last mile, pass\ning competitors(\"We run best at the end!\"), each kid hurt, but knew it\nwould hurt a lot more ifhe had to look his teammatesin the eyes as the\nonly one who failed to come through.No one failed, and the team beat\neveryotherteam atthe state meetby a large margin.\nThe head coach began rebuildingthe whole programaround the idea\nof\"firstwho.\" One ofthe assistantcoaches is a 300-poundex-shot-putter\n(hardlythe image ofa lean distancerunner),but he is withoutquestion\nthe rightwho: He sharesthe valuesand has the traitsneededto help build\na greatteam. As the programbuilt momentum, itattractedmore kids and\nmore greatcoaches.Peoplewant to be partofthis spinningflywheel;they\nwantto be partofachampionshipteam;theywantto be partofafirst-class\nculture. When the cross-countryteam posts yet another championship\nbannerin the gym, more kids sign up, the gene pool deepens,the team\ngets faster, which produces more championships,which attracts more\nkids, which createseven fasterteams,and so forth andso on, in theinfec\ntious flywheeleffect.\nAre thesecoachessufferingmore than otherteamsto createagreatpro\ngram?Are theyworkingharder?No! In fact, all theassistantcoacheshave\nfull-time professional jobs outside of coaching—engineers,computer\ntechnicians,teachers—andthey work for essentiallyno pay, carvingpre\ncious time out oftheir busy lives to be part ofbuildinga great program.\nThey're just focusing on the right things, and not the wrong things.\nThey're doing virtually everythingwe write about in this book, within\ntheirspecificsituation,and not wastingtime on anythingthat doesn'tfit.\nSimple,clean,straightforward,elegant—anda heck ofa lotof fun.\nThe pointofthis storyis thatthese ideaswork. When you applythem in\n\f\n208 Jim Collins\nany situation, they make your life and your experience better, while\nimprovingresults.And along the way, you just might make what you're\nbuildinggreat. So, I ask again: If it's no harder (given these ideas), the\nresultsbetter,and theprocesssomuch more fun—well,why wouldn'tyou\ngofor greatness?\nTobe clear,I amnot suggestingthatgoingfrom good togreatiseasy, or\nthat everyorganizationwill successfullymake theshift. By definition,it is\nnot possiblefor everyoneto be aboveaverage.ButIam assertingthatthose\nwho strive to turn good into great find the process no more painful or\nexhaustingthan those who settle for just lettingthings wallow along in\nmind-numbingmediocrity.Yes, turninggood into greattakes energy,but\nthe buildingofmomentumadds more energyback into the pool than it\ntakesout. Conversely,perpetuatingmediocrityis an inherentlydepressing\nprocessand drainsmuch more energyout ofthe pool than itputs back in.\nButthere isa secondanswerto thequestionofwhy greatness,one that\nis at thevery heartofwhat motivatedus to undertakethis huge projectin\nthe first place: the search for meaning,or more precisely,the search for\nmeaningfulwork.\nI asked the head coach ofthe cross-countryprogramwhy she felt com\npelled to make it great. She paused before answering. \"That's a really\ngood question.\"Long pause. \"It's really hard to answer.\"More pause. \"I\nguess... it's because I really care about what we're doing. I believe in\nrunningand the impactit can make on these kids' lives. I want them to\nhave a greatexperience,and to have the experienceofbeingpartofsome\nthingabsolutelyfirst class.\"\nNow for theinterestingtwist:Thecoachhas anMBA from anelitebusi\nness schoolandis a Phi Beta Kappagraduateineconomics,havingwon the\nprizefor the best undergraduatehonorsthesisatone ofthe mostselective\nuniversitiesin the world. She found, however,that most of what her class\nmateswenton to do—investmentbankingon Wall Street,startingInternet\ncompanies, managementconsulting,working for IBM, or whatever—\nheld nomeaningfor her. She justdidn'tcare enoughaboutthoseendeav\nors to want to make them great. For her, those jobs held no meaningful\npurpose.And so she made the decisionto searchfor meaningfulwork—\nwork aboutwhichshewouldhave suchpassionthatthe question,Whytry\nfor greatness?would seem almosttautological.Ifyou're doing something\nyou care that much about,and you believeinits purposedeeplyenough,\nthen it isimpossibleto imaginenot tryingtomake itgreat.It'sjusta given.\n\f\nGood to Great 209\nI've triedto imaginethe Level 5leadersofthe companieswe'vestudied\nanswering the question \"Why greatness?\"Of course, most would say:\n\"We're not great—wecould be so much better.\"But pushed to answer,\n\"Whytry for greatness?\"I believetheywould respondmuchlike the cross\ncountry coach. They're doing somethingthey really care about, about\nwhich they have greatpassion.Like Bill Hewlett,they mightcare first and\nforemostaboutcreatinga companythatby virtueofits valuesand success\nhas a tremendousimpactonthe way companiesare managedaroundthe\nworld. Or like Ken Iverson,they mightfeel a crusader'spurposeto oblit\nerate the oppressiveclass hierarchiesthatcause degradationofboth labor\nand management.Or like Darwin Smith at Kimberly-Clark,they might\nderivea tremendoussense ofpurposefrom the innerquestfor excellence\nitself, being driven from within to make anythingthey touch the best it\ncan be. Or perhapslike Lyle Everinghamat Kroger orCork Walgreenat\nWalgreens,they mighthave grown up inthe businessand just reallylove\nit. You don'tneed to have some grand existentialreason for why you love\nwhat you're doing or to care deeply about your work (although you\nmight).All thatmattersis thatyou dolove itandthat you do care.\nSo, the question of Why greatness?is almost a nonsense question. If\nyou'reengagedin work that you love and careabout,for whateverreason,\nthen the questionneeds noanswer.Thequestionis not why, buthow.\nIndeed, the Veal question is not, ttWhy greatness?\"but \"What work\nmakes you feel compelledto try to creategreatness?\"If you have to\nask the question,ftWhy should we try to make it great?Isn't success\nenoUgh?\":thenyou're probablyengaged in the wrong line of work.\nPerhapsyourquesttobe partofbuildingsomethinggreatwill notfall in\nyourbusinesslife. Butfind itsomewhere.Ifnot incorporatelife,then per\nhaps in makingyour churchgreat. Ifnot there,then perhapsa nonprofit,\nor a community organization, or a class you teach. Get involved in some\nthingthatyou care so much aboutthatyou want to make itthe greatestit\ncan possiblybe, notbecauseofwhat you will get, but just becauseit can\nbe done.\nWhen you do this, you will startto grow, inevitably,towardbecominga\nLevel 5 leader. Early in the book, we wondered about how to become\n\f\n210 Jim Collins\nLevel 5,and we suggestedthatyou startbypracticingthe rest ofthe find\nings. Butunderwhat conditionswill you have the drive and disciplineto\nfully practice the other findings? Perhaps it is when you care deeply\nenoughaboutthe work in whichyou are engaged,andwhen your respon\nsibilitiesline upwith your own personalthree circles.\nWhen all these pieces come together,not only does your work move\ntoward greatness,but so does your life. For, in the end, it isimpossibleto\nhave a great life unless it is a meaningfullife. And it is very difficultto\nhave a meaningful life without meaningful work. Perhaps, then, you\nmightgain thatrare tranquillitythat comesfrom knowingthatyou'vehad\na hand increatingsomethingof intrinsicexcellencethat makes a contri\nbution. Indeed, you might even gain that deepest of all satisfactions:\nknowingthat your shorttime here on this earth has been well spent,and\nthat it mattered.\n\f\nEPILOGUE\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\nQ: Did you originallyidentify more than eleven good-to-greatpossibilities\nand, if so, whatgood-to-greatexamplesdid not make it into the study?\nThe eleven good-to-greatcompanieswere the only examplesfrom our initial\nuniverseof Fortune 500 companiesthat met all the criteria for entrance into\nthe study;they do not representasample.(SeeAppendixLAfor the selection\nprocesswe used.)The fact that we studiedthetotalset of companies that met\nour criteriashouldincreaseour confidencein thefindings.We do not need to\nworry that a second set ofcompaniesin the Fortune 500 went from good to\ngreat—notby our criteria,anyway—byother methods.\nQ: Why did only eleven companies make the cut?\nThere are threeprincipalreasons.First,we used a very toughstandard(three\ntimes the marketover fifteenyears) asour metricofgreat results.Second,the\nfifteen-yearsustainabilityrequirement isdifficultto meet. Many companies\nshowa sharp riseforfive or tenyears witha hit product orcharismaticleader,\nbut few companiesmanage to achieve fifteen years. Third, we were looking\nfor a very specific pattern: sustained great results preceded by a sustained\nperiod of average results (or worse). Great companies are easy to find, but\ngood-to-greatcompaniesare much more rare. When you add all thesefactors\ntogether,it is notsurprisingthat weidentifiedonlyelevenexamples.\nI wouldliketo stress,however,that the \"onlyeleven\"findingshould not be\ndiscouraging.We had to seta cutoffand wechoseavery tough one. Ifwe had\nset a slightlylower hurdle—say,2.5 times the marketor ten years of sustain\nability—thenmany more companieswould have qualified.After completing\nthe research,I am convincedthat manyorganizationscan make the journey\nfrom good to great if theyapply the lessons in this book. The problem is not\nthe statisticalodds; the problem isthat peopleare squanderingtheir time and\nresourceson the wrongthings.\nQ: What about statisticalsignificance,given that only eleven companies\nmade the final cut as good-to-greatexamples and the total study size is\ntwenty-eight companies (with comparisons)?\nWe engagedtwoleading professorsto help usresolvethis question, onestatis\nticianand oneappliedmathematician.The statistician,JeffreyT. Luftigat the\n\f\n212 Jim Collins\nUniversityof Colorado, looked at our dilemma and concluded that we donot\nhave a statisticsproblem,pointingout that the conceptof \"statisticalsignifi\ncance\"appliesonlywhensamplingofdata isinvolved.\"Look,youdidn't sam\nple companies,\"he said. \"You did a very purposefulselectionand found the\nelevencompaniesfrom the Fortune500 that metyour criteria.When youput\nthese eleven against the seventeencomparisoncompanies,the probabilities\nthat theconceptsin your frameworkappearbyrandomchance areessentially\nzero.\"When we asked Universityof Coloradoappliedmathematicsprofessor\nWilliam P. Briggs to examine our researchmethod, he framed the question\nthus: What is theprobabilityof findingby chance a group ofeleven compa\nnies,all of whose membersdisplaythe primarytraitsyou discoveredwhile the\ndirect comparisonsdo not possess those traits? He concluded that the proba\nbilityis less than 1 in 17 million.There is virtuallyno chance that we simply\nfound elevenrandomeventsthat justhappenedto show the good-to-greatpat\ntern we werelookingfor. We can conclude with confidencethat thetraitswe\nfound arestronglyassociatedwith transformationsfrom good to great.\nQ: Why did you limit your researchto publicly traded corporations?\nPublicly traded corporations have two advantages for research: a widely\nagreed upondefinitionof results(so we canrigorouslyselecta studyset) and\na plethora of easily accessibledata. Privatelyheld corporationshave limited\ninformationavailable,whichwouldbe particularlyproblematicwith compar\nison companies. The beauty of publicly traded companies is that we don't\nneed their cooperation to obtain data. Whether they like it or not, vast\namounts ofinformationabout them are a matterof publicrecord.\nQ: Why did you limit your researchto U.S. corporations?\nWe concluded that rigor in selection outweighed the benefits of an inter\nnational study set. The absence of apples-to-applesstock return data from\nnon-U.S. exchanges would undermine the consistency of our selection\nprocess. The comparative research process eliminates contextual \"noise\"\n(similarcompanies,industries,sizes, ages, and so forth) and gives us much\ngreater confidence in the fundamental nature of our findingsthan having a\ngeographicallydiversestudyset. Nonetheless,I suspectthat our findingswill\nprove usefulacrossgeographies.A number of the companies in our study are\nglobalenterprisesand the same conceptsapplied whereverthey didbusiness.\nAlso, I believethat much of what wefound—Level5 leadership and the fly\nwheel, forinstance—willbe harder to swallowforAmericansthan for people\nfrom other cultures."

If\nthis studywere to be repeated in ten ortwentyyears, I would fully expect that\nhigh-technologycompanieswould makethe list.\nQ: How does Good to Great apply to companies that are already great?\nI suggestthat they use bothGood toGreatand Builtto Last to help them bet\nter understandwhy theyare great,sothat theycan keep doing the rightthings.\nAs Robert Burgelman, one of my favorite professorsfrom Stanford Business\nSchool, taught meyears ago, \"The singlebiggestdanger in businessand life,\nother than outright failure, is to be successfulwithout being resolutelyclear\nabout why you are successfulin the first place.\"\nQ: How do you explain recent difficulties at some of the good-to-great\ncompanies?\nEvery company—no matter how great—facesdifficult times. There are no\nenduring great companies that have aperfect,unblemished record. Theyall\nhave ups anddowns.The critical factoris not the absence of difficultybut the\nabilityto bounce back and emergestronger.\nFurthermore, if any companyceases to practice all of the findings, it will\neventually slidebackward.It is not any one variable in isolation that makes a\ncompany great; it is the combination of all of the piecesworkingtogether in\nan integrated packageconsistentlyandover time. Two current cases illustrate\nthis point.\nOne current caseforconcern isGillette,which produced eighteen years of\nexceptional performance—rising to over 9 times the market from 1980 to\n1998—but stumbled in 1999. We believe the principal source of this diffi\nculty lies in Gillette's need forgreaterdisciplinein stickingto businessesthat\nfit squarelyinside the threecirclesof itsHedgehogConcept. Of even greater\nconcern is the clamoring from industryanalyststhat Gillette needs a charis\nmatic CEO from outside the company to come in and shake things up. If\nGillette brings in a Level4 leader, then theprobabilitythat Gillette will prove\nto be an enduringgreat company will diminishconsiderably.\nAnother troubling case is Nucor, which hit its peak in 1994 at fourteen\ntimes the market, then fell off considerably as it experienced management\nturmoil in the wake of Ken Iverson's retirement. Iverson's chosen successor\n\f\n214 Jim Collins\nWill Gillette Go from Good to Great to Built to Last?\nRatio of Cumulative Stock Returns to General Market,\n1927-2000\n1927 1940 1960 1980 2000\nlasted only a shorttime in the job, before beingousted in an ugly executive-\nsuite battle. One of the architectsof thisboardroomcoup indicated in the\nCharlotteNews and Observer(June 11,1999,page Dl) that Iversonhadfallen\nfrom Level 5 leadershipin his old age and hadbegun to display more ego\ncentricLevel4 traits.\"In hisheyday,Ken was a giantofa man,\" he said,\"but\nhe wantedto take thiscompanyto thegrave with him.\" Iversontells a differ\nent story, arguing that the real problem is current management'sdesire to\ndiversify Nucor away from its HedgehogConcept. \"Iverson just shakes his\nhead,\"wrote the News and Observer,\"sayingit was to getaway from diversifi\ncationthat Nucorbecamea narrowlyfocused steel productscompanyin the\nfirstplace.\"Whateverthe case—lossofLevel 5leadershiporstrayingfrom the\nHedgehog Concept, or both—the future of Nucor as a great company\nremains uncertain at the time ofthiswriting.\nThat being said, it is worth notingthat mostof the good-to-greatcompa\nnies are still going strong at the time of this writing. Seven of the eleven\ncompanieshavethus fargenerated over twentyyearsofextraordinaryperfor\nmance from their transition dates, with the median of the entire group\nbeing twenty-fouryears ofexceptionalresults—aremarkablerecord by any\nmeasure."

Ironically,\nPhilip Morris has the longesttrack record of exceptionalperformancefrom\nthe date of its transition—thirty-fouryears—and is the only company that\nmade it into both studies(GoodtoGreatand Builtto Last).This performance\nis not justa functionofbeingin anindustrywith high-marginproductssoldto\naddicted customers.Philip Morris blew away all the other cigarettecompa\nnies, includingits directcomparison,R.

This isone ofthose findingsthat\nI find difficultto swallow,but that arecompletelysupportedby the data. (For\nfurther discussionof this topic,see chapter 3ofBuilttoLast, pages65-71.)\nQ: Can a company have aHedgehogConcept and have a highly diverse\nbusiness portfolio?\nOur study stronglysuggests that highly diversifiedfirms and conglomerates\nwill rarely produce sustainedgreat results. One obvious exceptionto this is\nGE, but we can explain this case by suggestingthat GE has a very unusual\nand subtle HedgehogConcept that unifies its agglomerationof enterprises.\nWhat can GE do better than any company in the world? Develop first-rate\ngeneral managers.In our view, that is the essence of GE's HedgehogCon\ncept.And whatwould be GE'seconomicdenominator?Profitpertop-quartile\nmanagementtalent.Think aboutit this way: You have two businessopportu\nnities, both that might generate $X million in profits. But suppose one of\nthose businesseswould drain three times the amount of top-quartile manage\nment talent toachievethoseprofitsasthe other business.The one that drains\nless managementtalentwould fit with the HedgehogConceptand the other\nwould not. Finally, what does GE pride itselfon more than anything else?\nHaving the best set of general managers in the world. This is their true\n\f\n216 Jim Collins\npassion—morethan lightbulbs,jetengines,ortelevisionprogramming.GE's\nHedgehogConcept,properlyconceived,enablesthe companytooperateina\ndiversesetofbusinessesyet remainsquarelyfocusedonthe intersectionofthe\nthree circles.\nQ: Whatisthe role ofthe boardofdirectorsin atransformationfrom good\nto great?\nFirst, boards play a key role in pickingLevel 5 leaders.The recentspate of\nboards enamored with charismaticCEOs, especially\"rock star\" celebrity\ntypes, is one ofthe most damagingtrendsfor the long-termhealthofcompa\nnies. Boards should familiarize themselves with the characteristics of Level 5\nleadershipand install such leaders into positionsof responsibility.Second,\nboards at corporationsshould distinguishbetween share value and share\nprice. Boards have no responsibilityto alarge chunk ofthe people who own\ncompanysharesat any given moment,namelythe shaieflippers;they should\nrefocus their energies on creatinggreat companiesthat build value for the\nshare/zo/cfers.Managingthe stockfor anythingless than a five-to-ten-yearhori\nzon confuses price and value and is irresponsibleto shareholders.For a\nsuperblook atthe board'srole intakinga companyfrom good togreat,I rec\nommend the book Resisting Hostile Takeovers by Rita Ricardo-Campbell\n(Praeger Publishers, 1997). Ms. Ricardo-Campbellwas a Gillette board\nmemberduringthe ColmanMocklerera and providesa detailedaccountof\nhow a responsibleboard wrestledwith the difficultand complexquestionof\nprice versus value.\nQ: Can hot young technologycompaniesin a go-go world have Level 5\nleaders?\nMy answer is two words: John Morgridge. Mr. Morgridgewas the transition\nCEO who turneda small,strugglingcompanyin theBayArea intoone ofthe\ngreat technologycompaniesof the last decade. With the flywheel turning,\nthis unassumingand relativelyunknown man stepped into the background\nand turned the companyover to the next generationofleadership.I doubt\nyou've ever heard ofJohn Morgridge,but I suspectyou've heard of the com\npany. It goes bythe name Cisco Systems.\nQ: How can youpracticethe disciplineof \"firstwho\" when there is a short\nageof outstanding people?\nFirst,at the toplevels ofyour organization,you absolutelymust have the dis\nciplinenot tohire until you find the right people.The single most harmful\nstepyou cantake in ajourneyfrom good togreatis toputthe wrongpeoplein\nkey positions.Second,widen your definitionof\"rightpeople\"to focus more\non thecharacterattributesofthe person and less on specializedknowledge.\n\f\nGood to Great 217\nPeople can learn skills and acquire knowledge, but they cannot learn the\nessentialcharacter traitsthat make them right for yourorganization.Third—\nand this iskey—takeadvantageof difficulteconomic times to hire great peo\nple, even if you don't have aspecific job in mind. A year before I wrote these\nwords, nearly everyonebemoaned the difficultyof attracting top talentaway\nfrom hottechnologyand Internet companies.Nowthe bubble has burst, and\ntens of thousands of talented people have been cast into the streets. Level 5\nleaders will view this as the single best opportunity to come along in two\ndecades—nota market or technologyopportunity,but a people opportunity.\nThey will take advantageof this moment and hire as many of the very best\npeople they can afford and then figure out what they are going to do with\nthem.\nQ: How can you practicethe discipline of the \"right people on the bus and\nthe wrong people off the bus\" in situations where it is very hard to get the\nwrong people off the bus—such as academic institutions and government\nagencies?\nThe same basic idea applies, but it takes more time to accomplish. A\nprominent medical school, for example, went through a transformation\nfrom good to great in the 1960sand 1970s.The director of academic med\nicine changed the entire faculty,but it took him two decades. He could not\nfire tenured professors,but he could hire the right people for every open\ning, gradually creating an environment where the wrong people felt\nincreasingly uncomfortable and eventually retired or decided to go else\nwhere. Also, you can use the Council mechanism to your advantage. (See\nchapter 5.) Fill Council seatsentirelywith the right people, and just ignore\nthe others. Yes, you might still have to carry the wrong people along, but\nyou can essentially restrict them to backseatson the bus by not including\nthem on the Council.\nQ: I'm an entrepreneur running a small company, how do these ideas\napply to me?\nDirectly. See chapter 9, where I discuss the applicationof the good-to-great\nideas in the contextof small andearly-stagecompanies.\nQ: I'm not a CEO. What can I do with these findings?\nPlenty.The best answerI can give isto rereadthe storyat the end of chapter 9\nabout the high schoolcross-countrycoach.\n\f\n218 Jim Collins\nQ: Where and how should I begin?\nFirst,familiarizeyourselfwith all thefindings.Remember,no singlefinding\nby itselfmakes a great organization;you need to have them all working\ntogetherasan integratedset. Then work sequentiallythroughthe framework,\nstarting with \"first who\" and moving through all the major components.\nMeanwhile, work continuously on your own development toward Level 5\nleadership.I have laid out thisbook in a sequence consistentwith what we\nobservedin the companies;the very structureof the book is a road map. I\nwish youthe bestofluck on your journeyfrom good to great.\n\f\nAPPENDIX 1 .A:\nSELECTION PROCESS FOR G000-T0-GREATCOMPANIES\nResearch-team member Peter Van Genderen was instrumental in the cre\nation of the selection criteria and in the \"death march of financial analysis\"\nrequired to use the criteriato find thegood-to-greatcompanies.\nCriteria for Selection as a Good-to-Great\nCompany\n1. The company shows a pattern of \"good\" performance punctuated by a\ntransition point, after which it shifts to \"great\" performance. We define\n\"great\"performanceas a cumulativetotal stock return of at least 3 times\nthe generalmarketfor the periodfrom the point oftransitionthroughfif\nteen years (T + 15). We define \"good\" performanceas a cumulativetotal\nstock return no better than 1.25 times the generalstock marketfor the fif\nteen years prior to the point of transition.Additionally,the ratio of the\ncumulative stock return for the fifteen years after the point of transition\ndivided by the ratio of the cumulative stock return for the fifteen years\nprior to the point oftransitionmust exceed 3.\n2. The good-to-greatperformancepattern must be a company shift, not an\nindustryevent. In other words,the companymust demonstratethe pattern\nnot onlyrelativeto the market,but also relativeto itsindustry.\n3. Atthe transitionpoint, thecompanymust havebeen an established,ongo\ning company,not a start-up.This was definedas having operationsfor at\nleast twenty-fiveyears prior to the transitionpoint. Additionally,it had to\nhavebeen publiclytradedwith stockreturndata availableat leastten years\nprior to the transition point.\n4. The transition point had to occur before 1985 so that we would have\nenough data to assess the sustainabilityof the transition. Good-to-great\ntransitions that occurred after 1985 might have been good-to-great\nshifts; however, by the time we completed our research, we would be\nunable to calculate their fifteen-yearratio of cumulative returns to the\ngeneral market.\n5. Whatever the year of transition, the company still had to be a significant,\nongoing,stand-alonecompanyat the time of selection into the nextstage\nof the research study. Tosatisfythis criterion, the company had to appear\nin the 1995 Fortune 500rankings,publishedin 1996."

Our initial list consisted of all com\npaniesthatappearedon the 1965, 1975, 1985, and 1995 listings.There were\n1,435 such companies. Most people know these rankings as the \"Fortune\n500,\"althoughthe total numberof companieslistedmay be asmanyas 1,000\n\f\nAppendix LA 221\nbecauseFortuneoccasionallychangesthe size and formatofits lists.As a base\nset tobegin our analysis,the Fortune largest-companiesrankinghas two key\nadvantages.First, it lists onlycompaniesof substantialsize (companiesearn\ntheir way onto the listby annualrevenues).Therefore,nearlyeverycompany\nin the Fortune ranking met our criterion of being an establishedongoing\ncompanyat the timeoftransition.Second,allcompaniesin theFortunerank\nings arepubliclytraded,whichallowedusto use financialstockreturndata as\nthe basis for more rigorousscreeningand analysis.Privatelyheld companies,\nwhich do not have to meet the same accounting and disclosurestandards,\noffer no opportunityfor an apples-to-apples,direct comparisonanalysis of\nperformance.Restrictingour setto the Fortune rankingshas oneobviousdis\nadvantage: It limits our analysis to U.S.-based companies. We concluded,\nhowever,that greaterrigor in the selectionprocess—madepossibleby using\nonly publicly traded U.S. firms that hold to a common reporting standard\n(apples-to-applesstock return data)—outweighedthe benefitsof an interna\ntional data set.\nCut 2: From 1,435 Companies to 126 Companies\nOur next step was to use data from the Universityof Chicago Center for\nResearch in Security Prices (CRSP) to make our final selection of good-to-\ngreatcompanies.We needed,however,a methodto paredownthe number of\ncompanies to a manageable size. We used the published Fortune rates-of-\nreturn data to reduce the candidate list. Fortunecalculates the ten-year return\nto investorsfor each company in therankingsback to 1965. Using this data,\nwe reduced the number of companiesfrom 1,435 to 126. We screened for\ncompaniesthat showedsubstantiallyabove-averagereturns in the time spans\nof 1985-1995, 1975-1995, and 1965-1995. We also looked for companies\nthat showeda pattern ofabove-averagereturns preceded byaverageor below-\naveragereturns. Morespecifically,the 126companiesselected passedanyone\nof thefollowingtests:\nTest 1: The compound annual total return to investors over the period\n1985-1995 exceeded the compound annual average return to investorsfor\nthe FortuneIndustrialand Servicelistingsoverthe same period by 30 percent\n(i.e., total returns exceededaverage returns by 1.3 times), and the company\nshowed evidence of average or below-averageperformance in the prior two\ndecades (1965-1985).\nTest 2: The compound annual total return to investors over the period\n1975-1995 exceeded the compound annual average return to investors for\nthe FortuneIndustrial and Servicelistingsoverthe same period by 30 percent\n(i.e., total returns exceeded average returns by 1.3 times), and the company\nshowed evidence of average or below-average performance in the prior\ndecade (1965-1975).\n\f\n222 Appendix LA\nTest 3: The compound annual total return to investors over the period\n1965-1995exceededthe compoundannual average return to investorsfor\ntheFortuneIndustrialandServicelistingsoverthesame periodby30 percent\n(i.e.,total returnsexceededaveragereturnsby 1.3 times).TheFortunelistings\ndo notcontainten-yearreturnsbefore 1965,so we decidedto includealltop\nperformersover the three-decadeperiodin the initialset.\nTest4:Companies founded after 1970and whosetotal return toinvestorsover\nthe period 1985-1995or 1975-1995exceededthe averagereturnto investors\nfor the FortuneIndustrialand Servicelistingsover the same periodby 30per\ncent (i.e.,totalreturnsexceededaveragereturnsby1.3 times)but that did not\nmeet the above criteria due to a lack of data in the Fortune list in prior\ndecades.This allowed us tocloselyconsiderany companiesthat performed\nwell in laterdecadesbutdid notshow upearlieron theFortunelistings.The\n1970 cutoffalso allowedus toidentifyand eliminatefrom considerationany\ncompanieswith historiestooshortto be alegitimatetransitioncompany.\nCut 3: From 126 Companies to 19 Companies\nDrawingupon the researchdatabaseat the UniversityofChicagoCenter for\nResearch in Securities Pricing (CRSP), we analyzed the cumulative stock\nreturnsofeach candidatecompanyrelativeto thegeneralmarket,lookingfor\nthe good-to-greatstock return pattern.Any companythat met anyone of the\nCut 3eliminationcriteriawas eliminatedat this stage.\nCUT 3 EllMIHATICLMJJBilEMA\nAny companythat met anyone ofthe followingelimination criteriawas\neliminatedat this stage.\nTerminologyused in Cut 3 eliminationcriteria:\nT year: Year we identifiedas the pointat which performancebegan an\nupward trend—the \"transition year,\" based on when the actual stock\nreturnsshoweda visibleupwardshift.\nX period: Era of observable\"good\" performance relativeto the market\nimmediately prior to the Tyear.\nY period: Era of substantiallyabove market performanceimmediately\nfollowingthe T year.\nCut 3 Elimination Criterion #1: The company displays a continual\nupward trend relative to the market over the entire time covered by\nCRSP data—thereis no Xperiod.\nCut 3 EliminationCriterion#2: The companyshows a flat to gradual\nrise relativeto themarket.There isno obviousshiftto breakthroughper\nformance.\n\f\nAppendix l.A 223\nCut 3 Elimination Criterion #3: The company demonstrates a transi\ntion,but anXperiodofless thanten years.

To separateindustrytransitionsfrom com\npany transitions,we decided to repeat the CRSPanalysisfor the remaining\nnineteen companies,onlythis timeagainsta compositeindustryindexrather\nthan the generalstockmarket.Companiesthat showeda transitionrelativeto\ntheir industry would be selected for the final studyset.\nForeach ofthe remainingnineteen companies,welookedbackin time via\nthe S&P industrycompositesand createdan industryset ofcompaniesat the\ntime of transition (within five years). We then acquired CRSP stock return\ndata on all of the companiesin the industrycomposite.If the companyhad\nmultiple industry lines of business,we used two separate industry tests. We\nthen created an industry cumulative returns index against which we plotted\nthe cumulativereturns forthe transitioncompany.This allowedus toidentify\nand eliminate from the studyanycompaniesthat did not show the transition\npattern relativeto their industry.\nThrough industry analysis, we eliminated eight companies. Sara Lee,\nHeinz, Hershey,Kellogg,CPC, and General Millsdemonstrateda dramatic\nupward shift relativeto the general stock market in about 1980, but none of\nthesecompaniesdemonstrateda shiftrelativeto thefood industry.Coca-Cola\nand Pepsico demonstrated a dramatic upward shift relative to the general\nstock market in about 1960 and again in 1980, but neither demonstrated a\nshift relative to the beverage industry. We therefore ended up with eleven\ncompaniesthat made it through Cuts 1through 4 and into the researchstudy.\n(Note: At the time of initial selection into the study, three of the companies\ndid not yet have a full fifteen years of cumulative stock data—Circuit City,\nFannie Mae, and Wells Fargo. We continued to monitor the data until they\nhit T + 15 years, to ensure that they would meet the \"three times the market\nover fifteen years\" standard of performance. All three did, and remained in\nthe study.)\n\f\nAPPENDIX 1 .B\nDIRECT COMPARISON SELECTIONS\nDirect Comparison Selection Process\nThe purposeof the directcomparisonanalysisis tocreate as close to a \"his\ntorical controlledexperiment\"as possible. The idea is simple: By finding\ncompaniesthat were approximatelythe same ages and hadsimilaropportuni\nties,linesofbusiness,andsuccessprofilesas eachofthe good-to-greatcompa\nnies at the time of transition,we were able to conductdirect comparative\nanalysisin ourresearch,lookingfor the distinguishingvariablesthataccount\nfor the transitionfrom good togreat.Ourobjectivewas to find companiesthat\ncould have done what the good-to-greatcompaniesdid, but failed to do so,\nand then ask: \"What was different?\"We performeda systematicand method\nical collectionand scoring of all obvious comparisoncandidatesfor each\ngood-to-greatcompany,usingthe followingsix criteria.\nBusinessFit: At the time oftransition,the comparisoncandidate had similar\nproductsand servicesas thegood-to-greatcompany.\nSize Fit: At the time of transition,the comparisoncandidate was the same\nbasic size as the good-to-greatcompany. We applied a consistentscoring\nmatrixbased upon theratio ofthe comparisoncandidaterevenuesdividedby\nthe good-to-greatcompanyrevenuesat the time oftransition.\nAge Fit: The comparison candidate was founded in the same era as the\ngood-to-greatcompany.We applieda consistentscoringmatrixbasedupon\na calculated age ratio of the comparisoncandidate to the good-to-great\ncompany.\nStock ChartFit: The cumulativestockreturnsto marketchart ofthe compar\nison candidateroughlytracks the patternof thegood-to-greatcompanyuntil\nthe point oftransition,at which point the trajectoriesof the two companies\nseparate,withthe good-to-greatcompanyoutperformingthe comparisoncan\ndidate from that point on.\nConservativeTest: At the time of transition, the comparison candidate was\nmore successfulthan the good-to-greatcompany—largerand more profitable,\nwith a stronger market positionand better reputation. This is a critical test,\nstackingthe deckagainstour good-to-greatcompanies."

Foreach good-to-greatcompany,calculatethe ratioofcumulativestock\nreturnsto the generalmarketfrom t-15tot+15to create a \"ratio of\ncumulative returns\" curve.\n3. Shift this \"ratio of cumulative returns curve\" for each good-to-great\ncompanysuch that at the transitiondate, the ratio of cumulativestock\nreturns to the market equalsprecisely1. This shifts the transition dates\nforall the good-to-greatcompaniesto a common referencepoint—time\nt. Do this bydividingthe ratioofcumulativestockreturnsto the market\nat each month (calculatedin step 2)from t-15tot+15by the ratioof\nthe cumulative stock return number calculated at preciselythe transi\ntion date.\n4. Use these shifted returns to calculate the average ratio of cumulative\nstockreturns to the market acrossall elevengood-to-greatcompanies at\neach month t-15tot+15. In otherwords,calculatethe averageof the\ncalculation in step 3 at t - 15 across all eleven companies,then t - 15\nplus 1 month forallelevencompanies,plus 2months,and soforth, for\nall 360 months.

The findings\ninclude:\n• Level 5 Leaders: The research team was\nshocked to discover the type of leadership\nreguired to achieve greatness.\n• The Hedgehog Concept (Simplicity within\nthe Three Circles): To go from good to great\nrequires transcending the curse of compe\ntence.\n• A Culture of Discipline: When you combine a\nculture of discipline with an ethic of entrepre-\nneurship, you get the magical alchemy of great\nresults.\n• Technology Accelerators: Good-to-great com\npanies think differently about the role of tech\nnology.\n• The Flywheel and the Doom Loop: Those who\nlaunch radical change programs and wrenching\nrestructurings will almost certainly fail to make\nthe leap.\n\"Some of the key concepts discerned in the\nstudy,\" comments Jim Collins, \"fly in the face of our\nmodern business culture and will, quite frankly, upset\nsome people.\"\nPerhaps, but who can afford to ignore these findings?\nJim Collins is coauthor of\nBuilt to Last, a national bestseller for\nover five years with a million copies\nin print. A student of enduring great\ncompanies, he serves as a teacher to\nleaders throughout the corporate\nand social sectors.

Drucker ^*\nkbook CEOs can't wait to buy.\" B^\n—USA Today\n\"Collins and his research team have been tackling one of the biggest\nquestions business has to offer.\"\n—Fortune\n\"With both Good to Great and Built to Last, Mr. Collins delivers two se\nductive messages: that great management is attainable by mere mortals\nand that its practitioners can build gre.at institutions. It's just what us\nmortals want to hear.\"\n— Wall Street Journal\n\"The difference is how hard Mr. Collins works to arrive at his simple con\nclusions. They are based on years of detailed, empirical research and are\nall the more powerful for producing such unexpected results.\"\n—Financial Times\n\"The Business Idea of the Year.\"\n—Fast Company\n\"Collins agai\nI. 4.1 .4 u. .:i4. *.-\nI II llll II mi I\nXO00BC4YG7Good to Great: Why SomeCom.\nUsedVeryGood"
