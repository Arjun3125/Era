Communication is a bit like love – it’s what makes the world go round, but
nobody really knows how it works. Communication is something natural,
something everyday even, yet most of us have only a vague notion of the
rules that govern it. Day in, day out, we ask questions, read, explain, write,
listen, argue, discuss or hold our tongues. But only a few of us have the
necessary tools to improve the way we communicate or to understand how
we’re being communicated with. This was the starting point for our
exploration of communication theory.
For this book we delved into some of the most important communication
theories, assessed their relevance, condensed them, simplified them in the
form of diagrams, and applied them to modern-day challenges. We also
enhanced them with practical tips and methods. The result: forty-four up-to-
date approaches for dealing with eternal problems, from relationships to job
interviews, fake news to the filter-bubble effect, small talk to the annual
presentation.
This book is actually an exhibition, which came about as follows: the
Museum of Communication in Bern, Switzerland, contacted us and asked if
we could explain the most important theories in communication history in
diagrams. Until 2030 you can experience this book live in the museum.J O B A N D C A R E E RHow to influence people
An American psychologist, Dr Robert Cialdini, has devoted much of his
career to one of the most basic and at the same time biggest questions
within communication: when do people say yes? Or more explicitly: can we
make them say yes?
Cialdini identified six universal principles that explain how you can
persuade someone to accept your suggestion:
1. Reciprocity: this is basically the old biblical principle: Do unto others as
you would have them do unto you. Put into action: if you want to get
something, give something. The right order is important: offer something
first. Then ask for what you want.
2. Authority: we tend to follow the advice of experts. We have more trust
in a doctor who is wearing a white coat and displaying diplomas on the
wall. Put into action: in your area of expertise, find out what the ‘white
coat’ is.
3. Consistency: we look up to people who are consistent in their words and
behaviours. Put into action: stick to one message. Don’t follow every
trend. Be the consistent one, people will remember you for that.
4. Consensus: we are herd people. We do what others do. This is called
‘social proof’. Put into action: if you want someone to do something,
show others doing it (‘People who bought this book also bought …’).
5. Scarcity: we all want that which is rare and we are all afraid to lose what
we have. Put into action: it might not be enough to talk about the benefits
of your offer; you also need to point at what people will lose if they fail
to act. This also holds true if people face change: they are usually scared
of what they might lose. Therefore it’s good to tell them what they will
lose if they fail to move.
6. Liking: this is the most universal principle: people prefer to say yes to
people they like. But who do we like? According to Cialdini there are
three factors: we like people who are similar to us; we like people whocompliment us; we like people who cooperate with us towards a common
goal.
‘Get in the habit of helping people out, and don’t say, “No big deal.” Say,
“Of course; it’s what partners do for each other” – label what happened an
act of partnership.’
Robert CialdiniWhy meetings take so long
It is one of the great mysteries of the modern world of work: why are
meetings so exhausting? And why do they take so long?
According to Seth Godin, there are only three kinds of meetings:
· Information: a meeting in which the participants are informed about
something (whether they like it or not).
· Discussion: a meeting which aims to give input or direction, or to receive
feedback.
· Permission: a meeting in which one side proposes something, in the hope
that the other says yes (but has the right and the power to say no).
What often makes meetings frustrating is the fact that different people
might think it’s a different kind of meeting. Here are some tips to make
meetings run more smoothly:
The fifteen-minute rule
Parkinson’s Law states that Work expands so as to fill the time available for
its completion (and not according to how complex it really is). Therefore it
makes sense to limit the time of meetings. Incidentally, studies show that
the attention span of the average person is between ten and eighteen
minutes. Ideally, you should use a timer. When it rings, the meeting is over
– immediately.
The question rule
There are three types of question that you can ask in a meeting: first,
comprehension questions; second, questions to support the process (for
example, to make sure that everyone has really understood everything and
is talking about the same thing); and, third, questions that show how much
you know, in order to underscore your own position or challenge another
person. All three types of question are legitimate, but they should not be
mixed: first come comprehension questions, then questions about the
process, then debate questions.The standing rule
In many companies, meetings are held with everybody standing up because
it leads to decisions being reached more quickly (see point 1). At
Washington University, studies showed that when they are standing, people
react more readily with enthusiasm, whereas when they are sitting, they
tend towards scepticism.
The smartphone rule
No smartphones during the meeting. Notes should be made by hand. Even
the White House supposedly followed this rule under Barack Obama.
If you want to call a family meeting, just turn off the WiFi router and wait
in the room where it is located.How to talk to your team
Close your eyes for a moment and think about the best boss you ever had.
Now think of the worst one. What set them apart?
Most likely, your best boss not only achieved good results, but was also a
good communicator. Good bosses get the best out of their employees every
day, or at least give them the feeling they are achieving their full potential.
But how do they do it? In the context of this book, the question is: How do
you communicate properly with your employees, with your team?
Obviously there can’t be a universal answer: every person, every
situation, every company, every relationship is different. At the same time
we all know that we should speak to our team the way we would like to be
spoken to: considerately, directly, clearly. We’ve translated these adverbs
into rules.
1. Don’t criticize
This might sound a bit too easy-going. And, of course, you have to evaluate
the work of your employees – that’s your job. But go easy on the criticism.
Only start deconstructing if you’re prepared to help with the rebuilding.
Keep using ‘we’. Especially when your team has lost.
2. Give praise (but not too much)
Go easy on the compliments, otherwise they lose their effect. If you
celebrate behaviour that you expect, you are lowering standards. Whatever
you do, don’t give praise simply to please.
3. Practise what you preach
Nothing rings more hollow than words that aren’t backed up by deeds. If
punctuality and friendliness are important to you, then be punctual and
friendly. Set the pace, demonstrate values, establish the tone. But pick your
battles, only set standards that are important to you – or that you consider to
be generally important. You ought to be good at upholding standards that
are important to you, and if there are standards that you regard as importantbut find hard to uphold, then you need to learn them yourself. Share this
with your employees. Nobody can be good at everything.
As a leader, get used to the idea that you are primarily responsible for the
supply of energy. In other words: motivating, advising, stabilizing,
providing momentum – and letting others shine.How to carry through every idea
Meetings are known to reveal a person’s character. Generally speaking,
there are four personality types in meetings:
1. The silent type says nothing, is thereby usually proven right, and always
thinks he or she knows better.
2. The opportunist is enthusiastic about every suggestion, especially those
made or favoured by the boss.
3. The ‘master of the obvious’ announces the obvious with great
conviction, as if he or she had just thought it up.
4. The nay-sayer’s purpose in life seems to be to pull apart other people’s
suggestions.
So how can you get a suggestion past these hellhounds? A particularly
effective method seems to be the Salami Tactic. Do not put your suggestion
forward all in one go, but serve it in small, easily digestible slices instead.
This portioning method has two advantages: first, the fear of a huge task or
bold idea is reduced; second, a measured presentation allows the other
participants to explore the idea themselves and think it through further.
And, above all, this tactic does not allow the other participants to recognize
your overarching intention. This makes it harder to fight against it. If there
are ideological rifts, it is better to take small, isolated steps and concentrate
on the matter at hand, not on the intended outcome.
And what do you do if someone tries to salami you? Simply ask: ‘Is that
everything?’ Keep on asking until everything is on the table. Only then start
negotiating, setting one slice of salami off against a slice of your own.
The origin of the term is unclear. Some sources say that in Hungary
Szalámitaktika was the name given to the gradual takeover of power by the
Communist Party.
Disassemble a truck into many small parts and a child can carry it.How to make a good speech
In his definitive work Rhetoric, Aristotle wrote that a good speaker has to
have three things under control: the argument (logos), the presentation
(ethos) and the audience (pathos). This may sound pompous, but it is just as
valid today as in ancient times.
In Aristotle’s day, there were only three different types of rhetoric: the
first was judicial rhetoric, which dealt primarily with past events. Then
there was epideictic rhetoric, which typically celebrated a person in the
present (a typical example is a eulogy, which, Aristotle wrote, addresses the
mourners rather than the dead). And, finally, there was deliberative rhetoric,
such as political oratory, in which the speaker attempted to persuade the
audience to carry out a certain action in the near future.
Aristotle, and later the Romans Cicero and Quintilian, established a
complex five-point plan for writing brilliant speeches, which essentially
boils down to this: you should put all the aces that you want to play up your
sleeve in advance. Good preparation, in other words, is everything.
Aristotle considered rhetoric not as a tool to convince the audience, but
as an art form to help present a persuasive argument. This was the end to
which the speaker should employ rhetoric. Because people with good ideas
are often poor speakers, he provided them with a toolbox full of rhetorical
resources. So Aristotle was in fact the first person to prepare academics for
their TED talks and keynotes. Below are six rhetorical tools:
1. Anaphora: repetition of a word or phrase, typical in political speeches: ‘I
demand justice. I demand understanding. I demand …’
2. Inversion: reversing the usual word order, such as in ‘Infinite is his
sorrow’ (instead of ‘His sorrow is infinite’).
3. Irony: saying one thing when you really mean the opposite, e.g. ‘I really
enjoyed being stuck in that traffic jam.’
4. Rhetorical questions: questions that make a statement, e.g. ‘Would you
like shiny, glossy hair?’
5. Analogies (comparisons): ‘He stood there like a dying duck in a
thunderstorm’ (banal) or ‘He was as confused as a comma at the end of a
sentence’ (creative).6. Antithesis: a contrasting thought to produce tension, e.g. ‘He was
beautiful, strong and … unhappy.’
In practice, the same applies to presentations as to speeches: read through
your text aloud several times (one full sheet of A4 is about four minutes of
presentation). Remember to integrate pauses. Look at your audience.
Breathe deeply.
A good speech is one that induces the listeners to change their minds, while
giving them the feeling that this change of opinion is their own decision.How to make the most boring lecture exciting
Why do all fairy tales begin with the phrase ‘Once upon a time …’?
The answer is relevant for anyone who gives presentations: according to
the sociolinguist William Labov, if we weave hard facts into narrative
patterns, associations with well-known fairy tales are evoked in our
memories which remind us of the pleasure of listening to them. With the
consequence that our attention span increases. Classic fairy tales follow a
particular sequence:
· Abstract: how does it begin? (‘Once upon a time …’)
· Orientation: who/where/when? (‘A king and queen had a daughter …’)
· Complicating action: the problem to be solved (‘But all around the castle,
a hedge of thorns started to grow …’)
· Resolution: solution (‘Then he stooped and kissed Sleeping Beauty. And
she opened her eyes for the first time in many, many years …’)
· Evaluation: what results from it? (‘And they lived happily ever after.’)
· Coda: what remains (‘And the moral of the story …’)
A lecture should be structured along the same lines. The idea is not new.
Aristotle (see ‘Theory of Rhetoric’) was already aware of the importance of
emotion in speech-making. And in 1984 the communication researcher
Walter Fisher came up with a radical thesis: people do not want logical
arguments; they want good stories. Our life is not an Excel spreadsheet – it
is a story with ups and downs. Fisher’s idea is summed up in his famous
‘narrative paradigm’, which represents a break with classical rhetoric: we
do not evaluate a story on the basis of arguments, but on the basis of how
much we trust or believe in the story (can I identify with the subject or the
people?) and its coherence (does the story make sense?).
Chris Anderson, the inventor of TED, says something similar about the
three rules for a perfect TED talk: 1. Don’t talk about a concept, a
deficiency or a product; talk about an idea. 2. Focus on just one idea. 3.
Talk about the idea in such a way that people will want to tell others about
it.The next time you have to say something in front of other people, start your
talk with this sentence: ‘Let me tell you a short story …’ or ‘On the way
here, something strange happened to me …’How to reach an agreement
Negotiation is the fine art of finding a solution to an apparently impossible
situation. One of the best-known negotiating methods, ‘principled
negotiation’, is based on the book Getting to Yes by Roger Fisher and
William L. Ury.
Let’s break down their strategy and apply it to real life: think about a
complex situation – negotiating your salary with your boss, pocket money
with your children, a ransom demanded by a blackmailer – and try to apply
the following principles to the situation:
· Thing, not person: do not be distracted by whether you like the other
person or not.
· Similarities, not differences: don’t think: I am in the weaker [or stronger]
negotiating position. Ask yourself: What does the other person need from
me? Do we have common interests?
· Good enough, not perfect: you should not be aiming for the maximum
possible. Because perfection is like the unicorn: it’s rumoured to exist, but
nobody has ever seen it. So, alongside your desired outcome to the
negotiation, have a Plan B prepared before negotiations even start. This is
called the BATNA Principle (Best Alternative to a Negotiated
Agreement). It offers the best alternative when an agreement can’t be
reached.
There are two schools of thought when it comes to negotiation: the first
believes that you have to negotiate ‘hard’ and ‘conquer’ the other side (‘It’s
not enough to win, someone has to lose’); the other recommends
negotiating ‘softly’ in order not to put a strain on the relationship.
‘Principled negotiation’ falls into the second camp and recommends
cooperative negotiation. Negotiating properly means that everyone gets
more than they originally hoped for.
‘You must never try to make all the money that’s in a deal. Let the other
fellow make some money too, because if you have a reputation for always
making all the money, you won’t have many deals.’J. Paul GettyHow to criticize
Feedback is one of the most sensitive processes in communication. It is
easy to hurt people with criticism, but false compliments are also unhelpful.
Harsh criticism damages our self-esteem and can lead us to make unwise
choices, but flowery compliments often make us too complacent.
As for the person giving the feedback: most people are prone to being
critical, as it gives them a feeling of superiority. They feel like they need to
crush bad or weird ideas.
Feedback can be analysed along two axes: it can be negative or positive
and constructive or destructive. So this gives us four different types of
feedback.
1. ‘No’ – negative, destructive feedback: you are simply told the idea is
bad without being given an explanation or offered an alternative. While
this can be at times an effective feedback it seldom changes the
behaviour of the receiver.
2. ‘No, because …’ – negative, constructive feedback: you are told you’re
wrong and then you are presented with the correct answer. This is how
old-school teaching works.
3. ‘Yeah, but …’ – positive, destructive feedback: most managers have
sooner or later heard about the importance of giving positive feedback.
So they start off by saying something positive about your idea, just to
deconstruct it afterwards and offer a contrary opinion (‘The idea is good,
but …’).
4. ‘Yes, and …’ – the appreciative response: try to find the one thing in
the proposal that works and build on that. This goes back to ‘appreciative
inquiry’, a method attributed to an American, David Cooperrider, that
involves concentrating on the strengths, positive attributes and potential
of a company or a person, rather than weaknesses. According to this
theory, focusing too strongly on the flaws of an idea or project stifles the
open and positive approach that is essential for good working practices.Careful: of course, we sometimes have to deliver crystal-clear or even harsh
feedback. But the point is, people learn better if they are offered
constructive feedback. We know this from brainstorming sessions where the
flow and fun increase the more positive the exchange. Collaboration, it
seems, dies when the response is negative and ideas are killed before they
are explored.
Whenever you are about to give feedback, ask yourself: ‘How can I make
this idea better?’ rather than ‘Why is this idea bad?’What happens when everyone has the same opinion
For a long time it was common knowledge that group decision making was
better than individual decision making. Even today we often celebrate
collaborations, consensual decisions and teamwork.
However, as early as 1972 a Yale psychologist, Irving Janis, pointed out
in a spectacular, radical paper that sometimes also groups make very bad
decisions. Janis had studied such debacles as Pearl Harbor or the Vietnam
War. And what he found was that these groups had rejected critical opinions
and outside information.
In the warmth of a like-minded group people reassure themselves that
they are right, that their analysis is superior to that of outsiders, that their
consensus is a sign of the strength of the group, when in fact they have been
looking only for evidence that confirmed their objectives. And any doubts
in the room were silenced because if everyone seems enthusiastic and
agrees with the plan, we will feel reluctant to speak up – even if we have
serious doubts. This, by the way, seems to be one of the governing
principles of Donald Trump’s leadership strategy: surround yourself with
yes-sayers.
Janis called the phenomenon that occurs when the desire for group
consensus is stronger than the urge to express an unpopular opinion
‘Groupthink’. If this happens, the group is at risk of making very poor
decisions. And even more: if many people are too sure of the same thing,
they become radical and imprudent. Researchers have observed this
phenomenon among jury members: the greater the consensus, the harsher
the judgement, and the surer the jury is that its verdict is correct.
When does groupthink occur?
Typically, when there is:
· High group cohesiveness
· High pressure to make a good decision
· Strong, persuasive, directive leadership
How can we avoid groupthink?Janis suggested several steps for preventing groupthink. Here are two great
recommendations if you are the leader of a team:
1. ‘Give a high priority to airing objections and doubts.’ In other words:
encourage all group members to speak their mind. Even and especially if
the opinion is unpopular.
2. Divide your team into two and form competing teams to study the same
problem. Compare results.
‘When all think alike, no one is thinking.’
Walter LippmannWhen the force is with you
Most theories in this book argue that good communication has to do with
cooperation. But in reality it’s sometimes a different story. It is no
coincidence that the book The 48 Laws of Power, a compilation of classic
power strategies by the American author Robert Greene, was a bestseller.
Borrowing from this book, here are some negotiating strategies that won’t
make you popular, but might help you come out on top. (Warning: even if
you prefer to convince people with good arguments rather than by mean
tactics, you should know these tricks because they are bound to be used
against you.)
Never argue hesitantly
If you are unsure about something, try not to show it to others. Doubt and
hesitation will only dilute your arguments. With ‘for and against’
formulations, your adversary will see an opportunity to pounce. So only
speak up when you’re sure you want to follow through your argument, and
stand your ground – even if your plan is flawed. We forgive bold people
their mistakes, but have no confidence in doubters.
Talk less
Counterintuitively, you should not try to convince the other person by
talking a lot. The more you talk, the more interchangeable and ordinary
your arguments seem. Every triumph that you achieve through words is in
reality a pyrrhic victory, because nobody likes to be argued into a corner.
Act ignorant
We tend to be dazzled by intelligence and charisma. Try the opposite: make
your adversary feel clever. He or she will be flattered and become
inattentive. When your opponent’s guard drops, you can attack. Acting
stupid is one of the oldest stratagems around. As they say in China:
‘Masquerade as a pig to kill the tiger.’Give up
If you can’t convince somebody, reassess your own situation: what will it
cost me if I give up now? A smiling confession of your own defeat comes
across as more self-assured than sullenness. And, what’s more, the less
interest you show, the less satisfied your adversary will feel.
‘Oysters open completely when the moon is full; and when the crab sees
one it throws a piece of stone or seaweed into it and the oyster cannot close
again, so that it serves the crab for meat. Such is the fate of him who opens
his mouth too much and thereby puts himself at the mercy of the listener.’
Leonardo da VinciHow to negotiate abroad
‘There was once a Finn who loved his wife so much that he almost told
her.’ It’s a joke, and yet not a joke. Because many Finns are indeed
introverted, taciturn people.
Anyone who has come into contact with other cultures knows that
stereotypes and prejudices can’t always be trusted (the Scots are frugal, the
Swiss are punctual, the Finns are introverted), but that they do often contain
a germ of truth. Or, to put it another way, you might say that while many
clichés are true, the more you get to know a culture, the more black and
white turns to grey.
In order to get to grips with a culture it is not enough to master the
language, as cultural idiosyncrasies are more apparent in the way we
communicate than in what we communicate. What is required is so-called
‘intercultural communication’. The term was coined by the Dutch social
psychologist Geert Hofstede, while its most famous proponent is the British
linguist Richard D. Lewis. In his classic book When Cultures Collide
(2005), he defines three main cultural types: the linear-active, the multi-
active and the reactive:
1. The linear-active, who include most of Western Europe and the USA,
talk about as much as they listen, have fairly restrained body language,
are polite but direct, like to deal in facts, and place value on the written
word. They don’t do two things at once.
2. The multi-active, such as Mediterraneans or Saudi Arabians, are
loquacious, gesticulate a lot, are emotional, juggle with facts, place value
on the spoken word, and do many things at the same time.
3. The reactive, such as the Japanese, Chinese and Koreans, speak less and
try to get their counterpart to speak first; they have very subtle body
language, are courteous and indirect, are non-confrontational, and place
value on face-to-face communication.
But, contrary to what our schematic categorization might suggest, there
are no pure alignments, only spectrums. Indians, for example, are hybrid –they are both reactive and multi-active. Canada is on the borderline between
linear-active and reactive.
Linear-active: if you are intrigued by the questions ‘What? When? How
many?’
Multi-active: if you are intrigued by ‘how’ people communicate and relate
to each other.
Reactive: if you’re convinced by ‘who’ says it and their experience and
authority.S E L F A N D K N O W L E D G EHow to (de)motivate ourselves
There are two kinds of self-talk: the first is the unselfconscious babbling of
little children as they play or the thinking aloud of contestants in TV shows
such as Who Wants to be a Millionaire? These types of inner monologue
were called ‘egocentric speech’ by the developmental psychologist Jean
Piaget. He believed they were a sign of cognitive immaturity. Today, we
know that thinking aloud is an excellent method for ordering our thoughts
and improving concentration.
The second type of self-talk is the inner dialogue. We comment on our
own behaviour in a similar way to a sports commentator reporting on events
during a football match (the only difference being that the footballers can’t
hear the comments, whereas we constantly have our ‘internal moderator’ in
our ear). In the field of psychology, this is considered to be a healthy form
of self-evaluation. However, a distinction is made between positive and
negative self-talk:
Negative self-talk typically contains one of these thoughts:
· Generalization: ‘I have already been left twice – people will always leave
me.’
· Rash conclusions: ‘Why doesn’t she call? I think she doesn’t like me.’
· Self-blame: ‘I should have done differently’ or ‘I’m a bad father.’
Positive self-talk is about breaking through the above negative patterns of
thought. It’s not about convincing yourself that life is great, but rather about
freeing yourself from a cycle of negative thinking. For example, if you say:
‘I’ll never manage it’, ask yourself instead: ‘What can I do in order to
manage it?’
In a nutshell: self-talk serves two different functions: first, concentration;
and, second, motivation.
‘[Talking to myself] is the only way I can be sure of intelligent
conversation.’
‘Edmund Blackadder’How we are (not always) all ears
Paradoxically, in our age of constant communication, the raw material of
conversation has actually disappeared: listening. Genuine, real listening is a
rare commodity and a great gift, because you are giving to the person you
are listening to your most valuable asset: your attention.
Here are a few suggestions of how to do it right, based on the
communication technique ‘active listening’ devised by Carl Rogers and
Richard Farson in 1957.
Listen, don’t talk
As the cartoon here suggests, resist talking about yourself. Or as the radio
host Celeste Headlee put it brilliantly in a TEDx speech: ‘If they’re talking
about having lost a family member, don’t start talking about the time you
lost a family member. If they’re talking about the trouble they’re having at
work, don’t tell them about how much you hate your job. It’s not the same.
It’s never the same. All experiences are individual. And, more importantly,
it’s not about you.’
Don’t finish the other person’s …
Some people have a tendency of impatiently finishing the sentence or
thought of the person they are talking to. Although very slow thinking and
talking can be irritating, don’t interrupt, even if you think it might show
empathy.
Your body language says a lot
Look the other person in the eye – but don’t stare. Nod – but only if you
want to agree with what they are saying or show that you have understood
something important.
Notice the little things
Listen out for details in what they are saying and pick up on these later.
This makes it easier to ask questions (‘You mentioned that you spent a lotof time as a child at your grandmother’s – what kind of relationship did you
have with her?’). And it lets the other person know that you were really
listening.
Be a friend, not a judge
Resist the impulse of giving the other person advice – unless of course they
specifically ask for it. Instead, take the conversation back to an exciting,
important part of the story: ‘Earlier, you said that …’ Take the person away
from the smooth surface to deeper levels: ‘How was it for you, when you
…?’ Or encourage the person to keep talking by simply asking: ‘And what
happened next?’
‘The most romantic gift: to listen to another’s anxieties for one hour,
without judgement or “solutions”, as an analyst might.’
Alain de BottonHow to start a conversation with strangers
Small talk is actually something very big. Those who manage to start a
conversation with strangers, break the ice and treat them like friends have
the world at their feet (see ‘proust’s Questionnaire’). But it’s incredibly
difficult. There has been little serious research into the art of small talk and
there are few reliable theories, but, nonetheless, here are some practical tips.
Ask for advice
People love giving advice. So, start your small talk with a request for
advice: ‘I want to buy a smartphone [or a cocktail or a book], but I can’t
decide which one.’ Most people will happily open up. Then thank them for
the tip and the other person will feel like a fireman who has successfully
extinguished a fire. The psychology behind this: if you ask for advice, you
create intimacy: intimacy makes rejection difficult. Therefore, if you want
to influence someone, it is a good idea to ask that person for advice first.
Ask a second question
We often ask something and then wait for the other person to ask something
back. This is not a conversation. Instead, use the old reporter trick and ask a
second question. If you just asked ‘Where did you grow up?’, then a good
follow-up question might be: ‘How has that place shaped you?’
Don’t ask: ‘What do you do for a living?’
There are two kinds of people: those who like to talk about their job and go
on and on about it; and those who are ashamed of their job, hate it or don’t
have one. The latter are reluctant to talk about this topic. The author
Gretchen Rubin suggests this simple but powerful tweak to the usual ‘What
do you do for a living?’ job question: ‘What’s keeping you busy these
days?’ Now the other person can choose what to talk about.
Don’t start a conversation about things that interest youMost people like to talk about themselves. This leads to us not listening any
more, but simply waiting for our turn to speak. But a conversation is not a
PowerPoint presentation. Don’t pitch your topics. Rather be the one person
in the group who is interested in the other person’s topics. As Bill Nye put
it: ‘Everyone you’ll ever meet knows something that you don’t.’
Listen
The way people deal with you depends on how you present yourself:
arrogant, worldly-wise or dull posturing brings out the same behaviour in
your counterpart. The supreme rule when making small talk comes from the
radio host Celeste Headlee: ‘Enter every conversation assuming that you
have something to learn.’ People forget what they talked about with you,
but not how they felt in your presence.
‘We have two ears and only one mouth so that we can listen twice as much
as we speak.’
EpictetusWhat happens below the surface
One of the most frequently cited and simplest but also most inscrutable of
all communication theories is the Iceberg Theory.
Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, believed that human
behaviour is governed above all by the unconscious – like an iceberg, where
only the tip protrudes from the water, while the usually much bigger and
mostly invisible part is below the surface. (At this point, it should be
mentioned that we do not know for sure who came up with this brilliant
metaphor – it certainly wasn’t Freud; some say it was Hemingway, who in
the 1930s claimed that an author does not have to explicitly reveal the
deeper meaning of a story (see ‘The Six-Word Rule’). It is sufficient if, like
an iceberg, only a tenth is visible above water.
If we apply this rule to communication, we could say that the visible,
conscious part of a discussion is the factual level (what we say or what we
talk about), while the unconscious part is the interpersonal level (how we
say it and what we really mean) – see ‘Lasswell’s Communication Model’
and ‘Watzlawick’s Axiom Theory’. This means we can control the factual
level, we can select our words consciously, but our gestures, facial
expression and tone of voice will betray our unconscious secret hopes,
repressed conflicts, traumatic experiences, base motives and animal
instincts, and appeal to the other person’s unconscious. The interpersonal
level decides how we will be perceived and how we perceive others.
The more we know about another person’s values, patterns of behaviour,
motives – in other words, the more we see of the iceberg – the better we can
understand the person’s words and actions. The best way to ‘lower the
waterline’ of your opponent or partner is to show more of yourself. If you,
for example, want someone to admit something, start by talking honestly
about your own mistakes.
‘Fear and hope are alike underneath.’
Richard FordWhy we don’t dare state our opinion
Let us assume that you have a five-hour train ride ahead of you, and in your
crowded compartment a person starts talking about tightening the asylum
laws. Would you like to talk to this person or not?
This is the ‘railway test’, which the German social scientist Elisabeth
Noelle-Neumann used to examine who sticks up for their opinion in public
and who doesn’t. Her hypothesis: the willingness of people to voice their
opinion in public dwindles in situations where they believe that the majority
opinion is different from their own. In other words, we do not like to be of a
different opinion to others. If we notice that the group majority has a
different opinion to ours, we remain silent. This phenomenon is called the
‘spiral of silence’ and can be explained by these six points, of which the last
two are arguably the most important:
1. Most people have a fear of isolation and observe the behaviour of others
to assess which opinions will be accepted or rejected. ‘We fear isolation
more than being wrong,’ wrote Alexis de Tocqueville in the nineteenth
century.
2. We exert pressure on each other: we pull a face, roll our eyes or turn
away when someone says something that does not comply with the
prevailing opinion.
3. Fear of isolation and a pressure to conform occur unconsciously. We do
not think about the extent to which we are guided by public opinion.
4. We tend to conceal our opinion if we think that it will expose us to group
pressure. If we feel public support, however, we tend to express our
opinion loudly and clearly.
5. If consensus on a subject prevails in a group, it is unlikely that a spiral of
silence will begin.
6. The number of people who share an opinion is not necessarily
significant. A minority opinion can appear to be a majority opinion if its
proponents appear confident enough and represent their opinion in public
forcefully.We become quieter if we believe that we are in the minority.How words can trigger actions
You can do an incredible amount with words. How to Do Things with Words
is also the name of the well-known book by the British philosopher J. L.
Austin from 1962, in which he substantiated ‘language theory’.
He argued that in day-to-day life we distinguish between ‘doing’ and
‘talking’ but that there is in fact no difference. Speaking is also an action.
His thesis: sentences have a ‘propositional’ meaning (this is the information
contained in the sentence), which can be ‘true’ or ‘false’. But sentences also
have an ‘illocutionary’ meaning. This means that we are doing something
when we speak, including something essential (‘doing something in saying
something’). Examples include requests, warnings, threats,
recommendations. Such an illocution can succeed or fail – for example, if
you don’t take the speaker seriously, the act of speaking has failed. Then
there is a third dimension, the perlocution. Here it is about the extent to
which whatever was said has consequences – so whether the person being
addressed acts on what is said or has a change of mind because of it (‘doing
something by saying something’).
Let’s take an example. If you say to a couple who happen to be sitting
next to you: ‘I hereby declare you husband and wife’, then the ‘proposition’
is the same as what a vicar would say at a marriage ceremony in a church.
The difference: the sentence is just words. But spoken by a vicar the
sentence has weight and effect; it is ‘illocutionary’ and seals the marriage.
And with a bit of luck it is also perlocutionary, if the married couple stick to
their vows in future. The sentence of the vicar thereby triggers subsequent
actions.
The Speech Act Theory explained in two sentences: ‘What do we do when
we speak? What impact do we have when we speak?’Which of our opinions never change
A question that continues to preoccupy researchers into communication is
this: when do people allow themselves to be persuaded about something
and when not? Why is it that some of our attitudes are deeply ingrained and
not up for discussion (e.g. allegiance to a particular football club), while we
change others at the drop of a hat (favourite TV series, for example)?
An explanation is offered by the Social Judgement Theory. According to
this theory, there are three factors that play a role in persuading us to change
our opinion:
1. The anchor point: this is our basic preferred attitude. This attitude is
hard to budge, and we are unlikely to change it, regardless of what
information we are given. So, for example, if we were to discover that
the players of our favourite football team were manipulating games, we
might be shocked, but it wouldn’t put an end to our long love affair.
2. Room for manoeuvre: here it is about which alternative attitudes we
find acceptable, regardless of our own. These are attitudes that we can
accept without having to hoist our anchor. This approach can lead to a
change of opinion in the long term.
3. Ego involvement: the most complicated part: what does our ego have to
say? Take the death penalty, for example, which clearly contradicts the
anchor point ‘human rights’, leaving little room for manoeuvre. But it is
conceivable that if we were personally affected by a murder, we might
feel vengeful towards the perpetrator and change our mind, at least
briefly.
The stronger our anchor, i.e. our firm position on an issue, the harder it is
to be persuaded by a different opinion. The stronger you pull at another
person’s anchor, the stronger their resistance. (How can you can succeed
anyway? See ‘Six Principles of Persuasion’.)
If you can’t change your mind, then you’re not using it.How to apologize properly so that the other person forgives and
forgets
Apologizing is one of the most difficult interpersonal communication
situations. A few years ago, a team of researchers from Ohio State
University tackled this issue and played through a variety of approaches.
We translate their findings into strategies:
Use ‘I’ sentences
Apologizing means taking on full responsibility for something. Sentences
like ‘I’m sorry that your feelings were hurt’, or ‘I’m sorry that you’re so
angry’, should be avoided (because what you’re implying is: it doesn’t have
anything to do with me that your feelings are hurt). Say it like it is: ‘I’m
sorry that I hurt your feelings.’ According to the research, a person is most
likely to forgive and forget if you admit full responsibility for what you did.
Don’t justify your actions
It is a natural reflex to try to justify your own actions. But also an idiotic
one. Because a justification is in effect a denial of the apology. The
following sentences are particularly counterproductive: ‘Come on, it wasn’t
that bad!’ or ‘I can’t help it.’ The injured person will be more inclined to
forgive if you come up with a reason rather than a justification: try to
explain your action without being defensive. Most effective of all are an
explanation and an admission of guilt combined.
Avoid ‘but’ sentences
An apology in which the word ‘but’ crops up is almost never understood as
an apology but as an excuse. Avoid at all costs.
Don’t ask for forgiveness
Asking for forgiveness is rarely effective. According to the research, you
can spare yourself the bother. Nobody likes to grant absolution.Change yourself
Even the most honest apology is worthless if you repeat the same mistake
three times. Making an apology is above all a commitment to making a
change and an offer to make amends.
When it comes to apologies, keep in mind there are only two ways: you can
apologize begrudgingly or sincerely. Choose the latter.How to answer the question: ‘How do I look?’
The truth is, all people lie. In certain situations – such as when we are under
pressure, have to justify ourselves, or want to make a good impression – we
tend more towards fibbing and telling tales than when we feel relaxed and
self-secure. But, from an ethical point of view, not every lie is bad. You
might, for example, lie in order to protect someone. In communication
theory, lies fall into two categories: do I benefit from the lie or does the
person I lied to benefit? This results in four different outcomes.
1. White lie – only the person lied to benefits: this is a fine, selfless lie in
which you risk potential loss to help someone out. Here, you typically
put yourself in the position of the person and, for example, defend the
existence of Santa Claus in the knowledge that the lie will be exposed in
due time. This altruistic lie gives us a good feeling.
2. Grey lie – both the liar and the person lied to benefit: ‘You’ve lost
weight!’ Grey lies are often part of cultural norms. In many situations,
when you ask: ‘How are you?’, you expect a lie in response: ‘Thank you,
things are great!’
3. Black lie – only the liar benefits: although you are guilty, you reject all
accusations: ‘No, I didn’t take the money!’ It is often also a bold
promise, a proactive lie: ‘If I am elected I will never raise taxes …’ Here,
bare-faced lying is used to your own advantage.
4. Red lie – no one benefits: this is the lowest form of lying. Saying
something with complete awareness that the other person knows the
statement to be false, even if you sometimes end up also inflicting
damage on yourself: ‘The largest audience ever to witness an
inauguration.’
‘If you tell the truth, you don’t have to remember anything.’
Mark TwainHow to sum up a whole life in six words
No one knows whether the story’s true, but it is a good one anyway. Ernest
Hemingway was sitting having a drink with some writer friends at
Lüchow’s restaurant in New York. They were talking about this and that,
and eventually moved on to what the ideal length of a good novel might be.
Hemingway claimed that he could write a novel in six words: the others
each bet ten dollars that he couldn’t. Whereupon Hemingway wrote: ‘For
sale: baby shoes, never worn’ on a napkin. Six words, behind which lies a
tragedy. Those who don’t gulp when they read this must have hearts of
stone.
In 2006, Larry Smith, founder and editor of SMITH magazine, asked:
‘Can you tell your life story in six words?’
A dumped 27-year-old guy wrote: ‘I still make coffee for two.’ ‘Cursed
with cancer. Blessed with friends’ came from a nine-year-old cancer
survivor. The singer Moby confessed: ‘Dad died, mom crazy, me, too.’ And
George Saunders summed life up beautifully: ‘Started small, grew, peaked,
shrunk, vanished.’
Smith’s formal restriction proved not to be limiting but stimulating, and
in the spirit of the pithy language used in social media, the logic of the 140-
character tweet and the compulsive succinctness of texts, six-word memoirs
became a hit.
The thinking behind the abbreviated form: language is beautiful, and its
diversity and complexity are a reflection of the depth of human sensibility.
But it is also an excellent tool with which to beat around the bush. The Six-
Word Rule is not a rejection of sprawling, convoluted sentences or endless
digressions; even Hemingway was of the opinion that not every idea can be
pared down. But before writing (or speaking), you should ask yourself these
questions: What do I really want to say and can I say it more succinctly?
If it’s important, keep it short.L O V E A N D F R I E N D S H I PHow relationships fail
An axiom is a valid truth that needs no proof. At the end of the 1960s, the
communication theorist Paul Watzlawick, together with other researchers,
came up with five axioms to explain how interpersonal communication –
especially in relationships – fails.
1. You cannot not communicate
A man comes home, sits down, stares into space and is silent. His wife
looks at him and asks him how he is. He says nothing – and yet he
communicates something. It is immediately clear that something must have
happened. Even if you say nothing, you are saying something.
2. All communication has a relationship aspect and a content aspect
The content aspect is what we say. The relationship aspect includes how we
say things, but also who says something (see ‘Schulz von Thun’s
Communication Model’). Who says something and how it is said always
weigh heavier than what is said. If we are offended by a complete stranger,
it affects us less than if our partner offends us. Also keep in mind Albert
Mehrabian’s 7%–38%–55% Rule. If we are talking to someone about our
feelings, this is the impact our words, tone of voice and body language
have: our words are 7 per cent, our tone of voice 38 per cent and our body
language 55 per cent responsible for whether that person likes us.
3. Communication is always about cause and effect
A woman is annoyed because her partner is grumbling. The man is
grumbling because the woman is annoyed. In other words: we seldom
quarrel with ourselves – it will always take two to tango.
4. Human communication makes use of analogue and digital modalities
In Watzlawick’s terms, ‘digital’ means verbally and ‘analogue’ means non-
verbally – in other words, eye-rolling, a smug smile, ambiguous intonation.
If the two levels do not correlate, then we’re not on the same page.5. Communication is symmetric or complementary
Relationships between partners are either symmetrical (equal) or
complementary (unequal). Symmetric means that we talk at eye level (in
the relationship); complementary means that there is a kind of hierarchy
(for example, between teacher and pupil). If we do not agree whether the
communication is complementary or symmetrical, it becomes problematic.
Everyone hears what you say. Friends listen to what you say. Best friends
listen to what you don’t say.How to ask good questions
In the late nineteenth century, light conversation (or ‘small talk’ in modern
English – see ‘Small Talk’) was crucial to the success of an evening. Being
refined was not about saying the right thing without having to think too
hard, nor was it about getting the other person to laugh at one’s charming,
witty remarks. Instead, the ideal neighbour at a dinner party was the one
who had mastered the fine art of asking questions. The explanation for this
is simple, and truthful, and can be summed up with this rule: we do not
appreciate those who are brilliant, but those who make us feel brilliant.
But because it is extremely difficult to ask the right question in the right
situation, a small crib sheet soon circulated around European salons. It
consisted of questions that seemed innocent but which bared the soul, such
as ‘Who would you prefer to be?’, ‘How would you like to die?’ and
‘Which characteristics do you most appreciate in a man?’ The author of the
questionnaire remains unknown to this day. In 1885, Marcel Proust (then
only thirteen years old) answered the questionnaire at his friend Antoinette
Faure’s birthday party. In 1924, Faure’s son published Proust’s answers;
since then it has been known as ‘Proust’s Questionnaire’. The fact that he
didn’t invent it, but simply filled it in, speaks in favour of the charm of the
above rule.
Proust’s questions have three key qualities:
1. They are open questions that you cannot answer with yes or no.
2. The questions require no prior knowledge; in other words, there are no
right or wrong answers, only honest ones.
3. They are questions that centre on your counterpart rather than on you.
We all admire people who give good answers. But we admire those who ask
good questions even more. The people we remember most are the ones who
really listen.Why we find it difficult to be friendly
Psychologists generally agree that conflicts need to be dealt with, but the
question is: how? The American psychologist Marshall B. Rosenberg
(1934–2015) developed the idea of nonviolent communication based on the
premise that it’s not what you say, but how you say it. He distinguishes
between speaking snappishly, ‘language of the jackal’, and speaking from
the heart, ‘language of the giraffe’ (giraffes have the biggest heart of any
land animal). This may sound like mumbo jumbo, but it comes closer to
reality than most management jargon. The language of the jackal causes the
speaker to feel superior and the person being addressed to feel bad. Typical
examples of jackal language:
· Analysis: ‘That’s wrong, because …’
· Criticism: ‘The mistake you made was that you …’
· Interpretations: ‘You do that because …’
· Appraisals: ‘You’re smart/lazy, you’re right/wrong …’
· Threats: ‘If you don’t do it immediately, I’ll have to …’
According to Rosenberg, statements like these are ‘desires in disguise’.
Because we have not learned to ask for something politely or to express our
wishes constructively, we resort to aggressive language. And aggression
leads to counter-aggression or submissive subjugation.
Giraffe language, on the other hand, works like this:
· Observe without evaluating: ‘You always look out of the window when I
want to talk to you.’
· Acknowledge and define your own or others’ feelings: ‘I’m worried.’
· Acknowledge needs and take them seriously: ‘I want to know how you’re
doing.’
· Express clear and achievable objectives based on these needs: ‘Please tell
me what you need, so that we can talk about it.’
But why is it so difficult to be friendly? Often, we ourselves are the
problem. Take the so-called ‘attribution error’: if we arrive late, there was alot of traffic. If others arrive late, they set off too late (or for people with a
negative frame of mind, the other way round). We are by nature prone to
pass judgement, and what’s more, it is easier to blame someone else than to
think about why something happened.
The essence of normal communication: we all like to be right. The essence
of nonviolent communication: we are better off if we resolve a dispute than
if we win it. Or in the words of Marshall Rosenberg: ‘Would you rather be
right … or happy …?’How we should express ourselves in order to be understood
People’s three biggest fears: loving someone without being loved in return;
searching for friends and not finding any; saying something and not being
understood. There is no solution to the first two. For the third there is at
least a principle. The British philosopher Paul Grice (1913–88) dedicated
his life to this problem and in 1975 finally formulated the so-called
Cooperative Principle, a basic rule for effective communication:
‘Make your conversational contribution such as is required, at the stage
at which it occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange
in which you are engaged.’
You might be thinking that Grice could have done with some language
training himself, but let’s take a closer look at what the Cooperative
Principle is actually all about. According to Grice, speaker and listener want
to (and have to) behave cooperatively. This means that one person wants to
be understood, the other to understand. In order for this to work, Grice
proposed four conversational maxims:
1. Maxim of quantity: say enough for your counterpart to understand, but
don’t say too much, or you will cause confusion.
2. Maxim of quality: tell the truth, don’t speculate, don’t dupe the person
into believing something different.
3. Maxim of relevance: don’t say anything irrelevant, don’t change the
subject.
4. Maxim of manner: avoid ambiguity, vagueness, verbosity and volatility,
and stick to a logical argument.
If we follow these maxims, then, as a general rule, we will be understood.
But what happens if we don’t follow them, which is the case in most of our
conversations?
· We can violate the maxims without being noticed. That’s called ‘lying’.
(‘Did you wreck the car?’ ‘No, I didn’t’ – although you did.)
· We can violate the maxims deliberately by saying something else but
expecting the listener to understand the message correctly. That’s called‘flouting’. (A typical form is irony: you look out of the window to see the
storm intensify. You then turn to your friend and say: ‘What wonderful
weather!’)
· We can refrain from cooperation. That’s called ‘opting out’. (If you say:
‘My lips are sealed’, this implies you know something, but won’t talk
about it and this will end all communication.)
Only say what is true and important, and express it clearly and simply.How much distance we keep from other people
Perhaps you know the feeling: you’re sitting in the cinema, the film hasn’t
started yet, the auditorium is barely a third full, and several rows are
completely empty. Someone comes in, looks around, walks past the empty
seats – and sits down right next to you! The feeling that you now have is
called ‘expectancy violation’. You expected something different – that the
person would find an empty seat, not one right next to you. In 1985, the
American Judee Burgoon developed the Expectancy Violations Theory,
which analyses how our expectations of another person affect the way we
respond to unanticipated violations of these expectations or social norms.
According to Burgoon, the following rules apply in the Western world with
regard to keeping our distance:
1. Intimate space (elbow room): up to 50 cm. Within this space, we expect
to be touched by the other person. It is reserved for close family, lovers
and pets.
2. Personal space: 50–120 cm. The typical distance we keep from
somebody we are talking to.
3. Social space: 120–360 cm. The distance we keep from people we do not
know, with whom we do not communicate, but whom we have nothing
against.
4. Public space: 360 cm or more. This distance is best explained if we ask
ourselves: which people do we avoid?
Of course, it is not only about distance, but also about physical and eye
contact. If someone turns away from us while we are speaking, it violates
our expectations of the conversation. This is most easily observed in
romantic relationships, where the usage of smartphones and social media is
for many a strong sign of divided attention and a source for trouble.
The distance we keep is also influenced by cultural and situational
norms. Different distance rules apply to dancing in a club and studying in a
library. In Switzerland, people greet one another with three little kisses; in
the USA, this would be regarded as too close for comfort.When in Rome, do as the Romans do.Why we should talk to each other about how we talk to each other
It’s an archetypal misunderstanding: A couple are sitting in a car and the
traffic lights turn green without the driver noticing. The passenger says: ‘It’s
green.’ The driver replies testily: ‘Am I driving or you?’
This example comes from Friedemann Schulz von Thun. His
‘communication square’ does not count as a theory in the narrower sense,
but it breaks down the many pitfalls of communication in a clearer way than
other approaches. According to Thun, every message has four layers:
1. Content (what I am informing myself about).
2. Appeal (what I want to achieve).
3. Relationship (my relationship to the receiver).
4. Self-disclosure (what I show of myself).
Our example contains the content layer (‘The traffic light is green’), the
appeal layer (‘Come on, drive!’), an allusion to the relationship (the
passenger wants to help the driver) and the self-disclosure layer (the
passenger is probably in a hurry). These are the four facets of the sender’s
message.
The person receiving the message – in this case, the driver – does so with
his own four ‘ears’. On the content layer (‘The traffic light is green’) the
two people are still in agreement, but the driver interprets the appeal
(‘Come on, drive!’) differently (i.e. ‘Why are you so slow?’) and finds this
insulting. He reacts accordingly: ‘Am I driving or you?’
We encounter this kind of flawed communication all the time: ‘Hey,
what’s this in the soup?’ – ‘If you don’t like it, eat bread.’ ‘When will you
be ready?’ – ‘Stop hassling me!’
The way we understand messages is determined by the sender’s and
receiver’s previous history, the context, the tone and many other non-verbal
signals. How can we solve misunderstandings? By talking to each other
about how to talk to each other; in other words, by practising ‘meta-
communication’. Because good communication occurs when intention and
understanding are in harmony.‘What is thought is not always said; what is said is not always heard; what
is heard is not always understood; what is understood is not always agreed;
what is agreed is not always done; what is done is not always done again.’
Konrad LorenzWhy it’s worth talking to each other
The twentieth century was the century of mass murder. Two world wars
took place within a period of thirty years. In-between, there was some lousy
diplomacy. The logic of this period was: ‘The clever side never gives in and
comes out on top.’ To win you have to take action, not negotiate. Europe
was in ruins by the time the game was over.
During this period, John von Neumann, a mathematician, and Oskar
Morgenstern, an economist, developed their famous Game Theory. This
theory examines conflicts in which the result for all participants depends on
decisions made by others – as in negotiations. Game Theory is based on the
observation that people in conflicts behave in the same way as they would
when playing a board game: they want to win, but do so by sticking to the
rules of the game, otherwise it won’t work. How do you win but still follow
the rules? The solution: by approaching and talking to each other. Or, in the
words of game theorists, by cooperating.
Let’s take a simple example. At some point, most adults decide not to
give each other Christmas presents any more. The pressure to consume is
annoying, and, in any case, what do you give a person who has everything?
But typically some people still do buy a present, even if they agreed not to.
The person who gets the gift but didn’t give one in return now has a bad
conscience; the person who gave but didn’t receive is disappointed. The
result: conflict.
There are only two logical solutions and both have to do with
communication: you have to decide whether (a) everyone or (b) nobody
gets a gift. But this super-simple Game Theory solution can only be
achieved if both sides go along with the plan and if they make a binding
agreement to stick to it: two complex actions that people find hard to carry
out.
‘Meeting jaw to jaw is better than war.’
Winston ChurchillHow your therapist talks to you
What does your therapist do when talking to you? He or she makes a so-
called ‘second-order observation’.
A first-order observer sees the world as it appears to him or her: the
world is simply there. The second-order observer, however, ascribes what
the first-order observer sees to how it is seen. Important: we cannot observe
ourselves observing (which is also why therapists can’t treat themselves).
This is often referred to as the ‘blind spot’. In other words, we are unaware
of the way in which we observe; we cannot see that we cannot see. So by
identifying someone’s blind spot, the second-order observer might open up
a new perspective, and make that person aware, for example, of the fact that
he or she could just as easily see something differently.
An example: a couple want to move in together, but she has one of those
flats that you simply wouldn’t want to give up: a great location, low rent, a
big balcony. And the flat would be big enough for two. He hesitates,
because he feels that he would be intruding and that it would still feel like
her flat. They cannot afford a new flat for the two of them. She sees only
the potential advantages of her flat, he sees only the potential
disadvantages. Both are first-order observers and are talking at cross-
purposes.
A second-order observer could give them another perspective: the couple
could move into the woman’s flat, but on the condition that it becomes a
shared flat that they move into as if it were new. This means she has to first
‘move out’ of her flat, before the two of them ‘move in’ and refurbish it.
Despite the fact that most people constantly think about themselves, it is
impossible to observe yourself while doing (or thinking) something. We can
only train ourselves to be more aware of moments when we act or think
according to old (and bad) habits. But in order to recognize these patterns
we need a second observer.
We can’t see that we are seeing something.Which ‘I’ do you use to communicate?
Here are two of the greatest interpreters of human communication:
· Sigmund Freud (1856–1939), the founder of psychoanalysis, believed
that hidden pleasures and fears from our childhood are the motivation
behind our communication problems.
· The psychiatrist Eric Berne (1910–70), however, believed that you do not
have to go on a painful journey into your past to get to know yourself; it is
enough to observe yourself in communication with others.
In 1964, Berne proposed in his book Games People Play a counter-model to
Freud’s theory, a book which due to its simplicity and clarity became a
bestseller in the genre of communication and self-help books. According to
Berne, it all starts with the three ‘ego states’ we adopt in relation to others:
1. The parent ego state: we all are a little like our parents. This is evident
when we patronize others or tell them what they should or should not do.
But also when we act thoughtfully, empathically or helpfully.
2. The adult ego state: we act like adults when we communicate in a
considered, controlled and relaxed way. In other words, when we treat the
other party respectfully and respond to criticism factually and
constructively.
3. The child ego state: we also carry in us the child that we once were. We
are unrepentant, defiant, silly or anxious. But positive qualities such as
imagination, curiosity and learning are also evident in our childlike
communication.
All states occur in one person. So what use is transactional analysis in
practice? When we communicate, it is always from one of these ego states.
We are not always aware of this; but it is most evident when we observe
ourselves. Let’s suppose that a proposal we put forward in a discussion is
rejected by the group. If we react in an offended way or respond defiantly,
we are in child mode. If we weigh things up rationally and realize that ourproposal was no good, we are in the adult mode. But if we argue morally
that the others are wrong because we are right, we are in parent mode.
If communication does not work, you should ask yourself: what state am I
in at the moment – parent ego, adult ego or child ego?How to talk to children (even if you don’t have any of your own)
If you’ve ever asked a child: ‘How was school today?’ or tried to explain to
a toddler that it shouldn’t feed washing powder to the cat, you know that
good communication can be more complicated than algebra. So here are
some tips from parenting experts:
· Be a role model: actions speak louder than words. A child won’t
understand that he shouldn’t scream if you scream at him.
· Correct content, not form: the child says: ‘I draw horsy.’ That’s fine, as
long as she is drawing a horse.
· Be consistent: ‘no’ means ‘no’ – even when the child is having a tantrum
at the supermarket check-out. Loophole: only make threats that you can
go back on without losing face. So don’t say: ‘If you don’t stop right away
we won’t go away on holiday.’
· Implement threats immediately: children learn more quickly and
effectively if you carry out your threats straight away. Instead of taking
away a toy once for a whole week (long duration, small effect), it is better
to take away the toy ten times for two minutes (small duration, big effect).
· Praise an action, not the child: ‘What you’re doing is great’ is better
than ‘You’re great.’
· Ignore bad behaviour: when a child does not behave according to your
expectations, but isn’t putting himself or others in danger, it is better to
ignore him than to rebuke him (‘selective attention’).
· Offer alternatives: give your child different options, but never more than
two, and only if an alternative makes sense (there is no alternative to teeth
brushing).
· Tell a child what she should do, and not what she shouldn’t do: it’s
better to say: ‘Please slow down’ than ‘Don’t run!’
· Ask questions that can be answered: ‘How was school today?’ is as
difficult for your child to answer as it would be for you to answer: ‘How
was March to April 2014 for you?’· Adults were children once, too: these rules of communication apply to
all ages.
‘It is easier to build strong children than to repair broken men.’
Frederick DouglassWhen we think of the best arguments
‘The term l’esprit de l’escalier (“staircase wit”) refers to opinions and ideas
that we express with clear, polished pithiness – and which always occur to
us too late. Afterwards, when we slowly descend the stairs, we are suddenly
much smarter than before.’ This is how William Lewis Hertslet described
the term in his bestseller Der Treppenwitz der Weltgeschichte (Staircase Wit
of World History), which was published in 1882.
Over 130 years later it is still as relevant as ever. We all know how it
feels when our brain starts to work only when the pressure of a stressful
situation subsides. Before a date or job interview, we know exactly how we
want to present ourselves, but when the small talk starts, we can’t think of
anything clever to say. Then, once the conversation is over and we have
closed the door behind us, we come up with razor-sharp arguments and
witty lines. In psychology, this phenomenon when your nerves fail under
pressure is called ‘choking’: you ‘choke’ on the expectations.
Many studies have dealt with this phenomenon, and have all come to the
same conclusion: paralysis by analysis. If you start thinking, you lose. If
you try to be quick-witted, you can’t think of anything to say. When you go
for that all-important penalty kick, your confidence plummets.
Psychologists recommend four tricks:
1. Expose yourself repeatedly to the same situation (so-called ‘practice
under pressure’), whereby the situation loses its uniqueness.
2.Wait five seconds before answering – your answer might not be any
cleverer, but it comes across as weightier.
3.Not so easy: imagine that you’re not in an interview but sitting in the pub
with friends.
4.Keep in mind that although being quick-witted can be impressive in an
interview, it is seldom required in most jobs.
‘Nothing in life is as important as you think it is while you are thinking
about it.’
Daniel KahnemanW O R D S A N D M E A N I N G SWhat kind of image we have of the world
In communication, there is a fundamental rule: how something is said and
by whom – the ‘narrative context’, or frame – determines how something is
understood. To take one example, if a sensational piece of news is printed in
a reputable newspaper, we are more inclined to believe it than if it is
reported in a tabloid.
This observation was made by Erving Goffman, who described this form
of interpretation as ‘framing’. If we look at a picture in a museum, we know
that it is art even if it looks like a stick figure drawn by a child. This is
because we have learned to recognize the frame ‘modern art’. Another
example: if we go to a restaurant, we know how to behave – how to interact
with the waiter, how to handle a knife and fork, and what to do with the
menu. We know this because we know the frame ‘restaurant’. In his seminal
work The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life, Goffman uses the imagery
of theatre and acting to describe human social interaction. He believes that
we each adapt our behaviour to each frame and are therefore a different
person in each situation. This means that there is no such thing as
authenticity. We are one person when we are at work, another when we talk
to our parents and quite another when we are lost in a foreign city and have
to communicate with strangers.
Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky famously showed how different
ways of phrasing frame a dilemma and affect people’s responses to a
choice. This logic is used to great effect in advertising. For example, two
yoghurts are on sale: one is ‘90% fat-free’ and the other is touted as having
a ‘10% fat content’. Although both contain equal quantities of fat, people
tend to choose the yoghurt advertised as ‘almost fat-free’, because the
frame for the yoghurt purports that it is a fat-free, healthier product. The
bottom line is: we seldom make rational choices.
There are no objective or authentic messages. Everything that is being
communicated is always framed. And if you want to decode a message, try
to understand the frame.Why the medium is the message
The Canadian media scholar Marshall McLuhan (1911–80), who generally
shunned the limelight, became the world’s most talked-about intellectual in
1967. This was because he had summed up the media revolution – the
transition from print to TV – in a single sentence: ‘The medium is the
message.’ The sentence is not as simple as it first appears.
What does it mean?
It does not mean what you might initially think, i.e. that the medium has
become more important than its message. (A hint: McLuhan’s theories
never focus on the obvious, clear-cut or logical.) Rather, the sentence means
that the medium is not important because of its message, but because it can
change our behaviour, our thinking and our lives.
And what does that mean?
If we use the word medium, we are usually only referring to the channel via
which information is transmitted. McLuhan believed that this channel is
more formative for our culture than the message it carries. If the message
changes, we simply change our minds. But when the medium changes, we
change our behaviour. This sounded crazy in the 1960s. But since the
advent of social media, and since we have started to reflect on the ways in
which mobile devices dominate our everyday lives, it makes much more
sense. Suddenly, his meaning is crystal-clear: it’s not what we read on our
smartphone that changes our behaviour, but that we are reading it on our
smartphone. (What makes our smartphone so fascinating that we stroke it
more than our new-born child? – See ‘The Uses and Gratifications
Theory’.)
‘We shape our tools and the tools shape us,’ wrote McLuhan. He also
wrote: ‘People don’t really read newspapers. They just climb into them
every morning like into a hot bath.’ Was there ever a better description for
the Internet? In his time, McLuhan was taken more seriously by hippies
than academics. This was a double misunderstanding, because, as a
conservative Catholic, he was opposed to the media developments he
described.The news doesn’t change us; the medium does: take a minute and make a
list of five things that have changed in your behaviour since using a
smartphone. Now ask yourself: what changes do you regret? And finally:
what would it take to undo them?What happens if you don’t look at your smartphone
The Internet has multiplied the number of ways in which we communicate.
While we still communicate one to one (in a personal email, for example),
we now also often communicate one to many (e.g. in a Facebook post or
WhatsApp group message).
One of the most important elements of online communication is self-
presentation: we only want to show our best side. We post photos of
perfectly prepared dishes, perfect holidays, perfect parties, perfect scores.
And this starts a vicious circle: whenever we feel bored or alone, we look at
our smartphone. But what are we looking for? We basically want to see that
others have seen us – a ‘like’, a ‘share’, a ‘retweet’ is proof of that. But
when looking at social media we also see the apparently perfect lives of our
friends – which we are not part of – and how these lives are being ‘liked’
and ‘shared’. Scientists call the ‘uneasy and sometimes all-consuming
feeling that we’re missing out – that our peers are doing or in possession of
more or something better than we are’ – ‘Fear of Missing Out’, or FoMO. A
team of psychologists at the University of Essex, led by Andy Przybylski,
came up with this name.
People under the age of thirty-five suffer more from this phenomenon,
men more than women, teenagers more than adults, unhappy more than
happy people. To clarify: it’s not a question of really missing out on
something; it’s about the feeling of having missed out on something. We’ve
all been there: when we’re feeling down, bored or stressed out, we check
our smartphone. But all this does is make us feel even worse. Smartphones
act like an accelerant when it comes to FoMO – and thereby corroborate the
fifty-year-old ‘McLuhan’s Media Theory’: ‘The medium is the message.’
‘In the twentieth century “I think, therefore I am” no longer applies, but
rather “Others are thinking of me, therefore I am.” ’
Peter SloterdijkHow to recognize fake news
The term ‘fake news’ has become ubiquitous in recent years. But what is
fake news? Basically it is an aggressive way to influence people. But, fake
or not, all news is influencing – something which the inventor of public
relations, Edward L. Bernays, took full advantage of. (Fun fact: Bernays
was the nephew of Sigmund Freud, founder of psychoanalysis.) His most
famous work, which he wrote in 1927, was originally entitled Propaganda,
but he later changed the name to Public Relations. Bernays wrote: ‘The
conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions
of the masses is an important element in democratic society … We are
governed, our minds moulded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested,
largely by men we have never heard of.’ It’s a pretty good description of the
world we live in, isn’t it? But how should we interpret Bernays’s strangely
euphoric-sounding text?
Like this: freedom of expression is a democratic right. When everyone
expresses their opinion, millions of opinions and interests collide, and chaos
ensues. So either you create order out of the chaos by implementing
restrictions (which would be a dictatorship) or you have to make your own
opinion as attractive as possible and market it as such. You can use all the
tricks of the trade to come out on top. You can manipulate a little, cheat a
little, exaggerate a little to make yourself more interesting. Ideas can be
presented as attractive or less attractive, and it is up to individuals to decide
whether they want to follow them. This means: PR and advertising or even
fake news cannot force us to do anything we don’t want.
If you want to analyse (fake) news, a good starting point is the light-
hearted model developed by the American sociologist Harold D. Lasswell
in 1948, which still works astonishingly well today: for example, to
separate fakes from facts. The formula is: ‘Who says what in which channel
to whom with what effect’:
· WHO?: by answering ‘who’ said it, we divert our attention to the sender.
Lasswell called this ‘control analysis’: who is talking? What is their aim?
Who are their allies?
· WHAT?: by looking at ‘what’ is being said, we give attention to the
actual message (the ‘content analysis’) – to identify the aim behind themessage we can, for example, ask: how are women or people of colour
represented? What does the phrasing imply?
· WHICH?: by answering the ‘which channel’ question we make a ‘media-
analysis’: why are they using this channel? How can they afford it? Who
paid for it?
· TO WHOM?: the ‘audience analysis’ can, for example, reveal something
about the aim of the sender: why are they talking specifically to these
people?
· WITH WHAT EFFECT?: with the ‘effect analysis’ we ask: how did the
audience react? What does this tell us about the sender?
Lasswell was concerned with the effects of mass media. But his message
also applies to interpersonal communication. His formula is a simple way to
sharpen your senses for propaganda. Wherever it’s coming from.What we want when we’re online
What makes screens so attractive was a question already being asked by
researchers in the early days of television. In 1960, the sociologist Elihu
Katz claimed to have the answer. His ‘Uses and Gratifications Theory’ was
radically different from other media effect theories. He believed that media
consumption was an active, voluntary decision, and consequently did not
ask what media does to us, but what we do with media. He identified five
reasons why we use media and what we use it for (spoiler alert: the first
three reasons are obvious, the second two interesting):
1. Information and education: we consume media to discover what has
happened but also to educate ourselves.
2. Entertainment: we consume media for our emotional or aesthetic
pleasure.
3. Identification: we consume media because we identify with people we
see on screen.
4. Integration and social interaction: we consume media so that later we
can talk about what we saw or heard with others. Today the so-called
‘second screen’ comes into play: we watch TV and at the same time
consume via a second screen like a smartphone, with the consequence
that we are alone and yet not lonely (for example, #doctorwho or
#strictly) – see ‘The FoMO Phenomenon’.
5. Escapism: we consume media to escape reality. Everyone is familiar
with this behaviour: we immerse ourselves in a film, a game or the
Internet and forget about ourselves.
It is important to notice that according to this theory media do not force us
into anything – we decide for ourselves what we want to use.
‘When I die I want my tombstone to say “Free WiFi” so people will visit
more often.’
UnknownHow messages can be understood differently
A small but significant question: is what I can hear the same as what you
are saying?
Every child that has ever played Chinese Whispers knows the answer:
not always.
One of the greatest communication theorists, Stuart Hall (1932–2014),
was of the same opinion. In fact, he took the idea further. He believed not
only that we are capable of misunderstanding, but that we play an active
role in understanding, per se. We interpret, or ‘decode’, the same message
differently, depending on our social class, our level of knowledge and our
cultural background. But, above all, the way we understand a message also
depends on how we want to understand it. An example is the cult 1960s TV
series Star Trek. Many fans interpreted the series as a classic science fiction
adventure in space. But the gay community saw the close-knit relationships
between the men and the rainbow crew (black African, Asian, Russian,
Vulcan) as an allusion to the fact that some of the characters were gay. It is
irrelevant that Star Trek’s creator, Gene Roddenberry, denied this, because,
according to Stuart Hall, the message can be changed once it has been
received. In other words, Star Trek fans saw in the series what they wanted
to see.
The Encoding/Decoding Model contradicts the classic sender–receiver
model, according to which the recipient plays a passive role. Hall argued
that the way we receive a message is an active and never clear-cut process,
so that the message can always be understood differently. The sender
encodes the message with a particular intention. The receiver decodes the
message in order to understand it. And this decoding can happen in three
different ways:
1. Dominant-hegemonic: the desired reading – we understand the message
the way it was intended
2. Oppositional: we oppose or dismiss the intended meaning
3. Negotiated: a combination of the two
A message is more than just what is said. It changes depending on how it is
understood.Let’s put this into practice: if you are a leader, always make your team
repeat to you how they have understood your message. (That is, by the way,
the reason why co-pilots always repeat what they just heard the pilot say.)How we interpret signs
When we want to communicate something, we use signs – words, gestures,
facial expressions, formulas, symbols or traffic signs – that the other person
has to translate into meaning. Semiotics is the study of signs; it is a cross-
section of sciences from the disciplines of psychology, philosophy,
sociology, linguistics, computer science, design, art and mathematics. The
bottom line is: we find signs everywhere we come across culture rather than
nature.
The key points in brief:
· Some signs – the swastika, a traffic light, the Nike swoosh – are easy to
spot and more legible than words. We see them and understand what is
meant. A story, a rating, a command or a message springs to mind.
· Perception in most people proceeds from image to text. We remember
drawings better than words, recognize patterns in representations more
than in sentences.
· Some of the most important semioticians believe that all the following are
signs: a Rolls-Royce in front of the door, a blue sky, a hundred-dollar
note, open shoelaces, a half-empty or half-full glass of water, a magic
formula, a traffic jam on the motorway, a sunset. Nothing can be
perceived merely as what it is. It will always (have to) be interpreted by
the viewer as a sign of something.
‘The visual is like the political: everyone thinks they understand
something about it, and to an extent this is true.’ So says the German
Professor of Mass Communication, Marion G. Müller. She makes an
important point about the design of signs and symbols: they are complex
but need to be comprehensible, otherwise there can be no communication.
Most people understand complicated matter better through images than in
words. We remember pictures better than text and are more likely to
recognize patterns in images than in sentences.How we obfuscate with language
Speaking in euphemisms is a form of linguistic whitewashing.
Governments prefer to speak of ‘enhanced interrogation methods’ rather
than torture. The company spokesman will not say that staff are being
dismissed, but that the company is ‘restructuring’. Products are ‘a bargain’,
not cheap. If we tell a lie we are simply ‘stretching the truth’. And when we
are broke, we can give it the fancy expression ‘negative cash flow’. The
opposite of a euphemism – when you give something a negative meaning –
is called a dysphemism: someone with strong political views will
immediately become an ‘extremist’.
Euphemisms are the stealth bombers of rhetoric. At first glance they are
not visible, but their attacks are insidious: by the time you become aware of
them, the damage is already done. The Nazis loved euphemisms: ‘land
consolidation’ instead of expulsion, ‘labour camp’ instead of concentration
camp, ‘special action’ instead of killing.
Euphemisms crop up in almost all political and corporate
communications; for example, a town hall meeting might suggest a friendly
local gathering where everyone can contribute, but in fact the CEO just
wants to get a particular message across. Downsizing suggests a sort of
inevitability to making a company somewhat cosier in size without
mentioning job cuts.
Euphemisms are the mother tongue of manipulation. As a rule of thumb, if
someone doesn’t use straight language, don’t act straight away – pause
before acting.How you can explain practically anything with spurious
correlations
In Ancient Greece, debate was central to the forming of opinions. A
distinction between good and bad reasoning was made:
· Good reasoning aims to convince, but it also lets itself be convinced.
Simply put, it is the search for truth.
· Bad reasoning has no interest in the truth; it is simply about wanting to be
right.
Plato called bad reasoning ‘sophistic’. The Sophists claimed to be able to
justify any position through reasoning and logic. They aimed at defeating
their opponents in debates using rhetorical strategies (see ‘Theory of
Rhetoric’) and logical arguments. The Sophists were unpopular, despised
and – successful.
A well-known example is that of Euathlus, who was educated in
sophistry by Protagoras. They made an agreement that Euathlus would only
have to pay for his instruction after he won his first lawsuit. But after his
education Euathlus took up a different profession. Therefore he did not
conduct any lawsuits, could not win any, and argued that he did not have to
pay for his instruction. Subsequently, Protagoras sued him and argued
sophistically: ‘Euathlus will pay: if he wins the case, he will have to pay
according to the original agreement, and if he loses, the court will order him
to pay.’ Euathlus, Protagoras’ best-trained Sophist, replied: ‘I will not have
to pay on any account: because if I lose the case I do not have to pay
according to the original agreement, and if I win, I will owe you nothing
according to the verdict.’ It is an ingenious, logical argument, but also a
deliberately induced fallacy – a sophism.
Now, you should not think that sophism died out with the Ancient
Greeks. On the contrary: it still exists and is in excellent health! Modern
instances of sophism are spurious relationships: ‘In spring, storks return
from the south. In spring the number of births demonstrably increases. The
two things must be linked!’ No. The two statements correlate, but are not
causal. What’s more, they have nothing to do with each other.‘Most of you will have heard the maxim “Correlation does not imply
causation.” Just because two variables have a statistical relationship with
each other does not mean that one is responsible for the other. For instance,
ice cream sales and forest fires are correlated because both occur more
often in the summer heat. But there is no causation; you don’t set a patch of
the Montana brush on fire when you buy a pint of Häagen-Dazs.’
Nate SilverHow the media corroborates our opinions
One of the most frequently cited communication theories is George
Gerbner’s Cultivation Theory from 1976, which claims that people who
watch a lot of television are more likely to ‘cultivate’ the belief that reality
corresponds with what they are seeing on TV . He argued that watching a lot
of television changes our perception of reality and causes anxiety.
The mass media – in the past film and TV , nowadays mostly games and
the Internet – confronts us with an exaggerated, stylized world. According
to Gerbner, those who consume a lot of media start to see the real world in
the way it is stylized on screen. Some examples: in everyday life we rarely
see a policeman with a drawn gun; in a crime drama, however, it is
standard. In reality we rarely see violence; on screen we see it all the time.
According to Gerbner, if we consume these kinds of on-screen images over
a long period of time, our perception of reality changes and we begin to
internalize it. Even if we don’t actually see any violence, we start to believe
the world is a violent place. And the more violent and frightening images
we see, the more anxious we become in our everyday lives.
So the media influences us. But to what extent? Does it mean, for
example, that excessively playing FPS (First Person Shooter) games will
cause the player to go on a killing spree? No, the media does not form our
opinions and beliefs, but it does reinforce them. So somebody who already
has violent fantasies will find affirmation for them online. But somebody
who coexists peacefully with others will not turn into a serial killer by
watching violent films several nights in a row.
It is important to remember that we prefer to watch things we enjoy – as
is demonstrated most clearly by the filter-bubble effect: on the Internet,
algorithms try to predict what information we will be looking for based on
our interests and opinions. That way there is little chance of being
convinced by a different opinion, because we are unlikely to be ‘served’
any alternative views. When it comes to decision making this kind of self-
confirming information proves a huge risk, as explained in the chapter on
‘Groupthink’.
The Cultivation Theory has been criticized for its lack of complexity.
Viewers are regarded as passive and easy to manipulate. If you areinterested in the opposite view, take a look at ‘The Encoding/Decoding
Model’.
If you like apples and spend hours watching a TV programme about pears,
you won’t suddenly prefer pears afterwards. But if you already like pears
and spend hours watching a programme about pears, you will like pears
even more afterwards.What opinion has to do with power
Everyone has a voice, but not everyone is heard. The voices that prevail are
called ‘hegemonic’. The creation of hegemony has little to do with
democracy and everything to do with power. It is not a question of who has
something legitimate or important to say, but always of who has sufficient
resources and influence in a society to define their opinion as legitimate or
important. The hegemonic perspective is considered neutral. Anything that
deviates from it is seen as an exception and ascribed to others. The
hegemonic view claims not to represent a specific point of view, position or
life experience, but rather to represent things as simply ‘the way they are’.
An example: the media in the Western world is dominated by white male
journalists. Nevertheless, the news never announces: ‘Today you will hear
the news from a white male perspective.’ ‘White’ and ‘male’ are not
explicitly named; they are regarded as general, neutral and non-specific.
Another example: if a married couple are heterosexual, their sexual
orientation isn’t mentioned; if they are homosexual it is.
The question of hegemonic voices is associated with the concept of
which truths prevail. Here we come to the Standpoint Theory, whose most
important proponents are Donna Haraway and Sandra Harding. They
maintain that a voice – or standpoint – cannot be objective or neutral, or
exist outside a specific social context. Here is an example: in science – and
in children’s books to the present day – the idea that prehistoric people
hunted mammoths was long considered to be fact. Prehistoric people, or,
more concretely, prehistoric men, set off on dangerous mammoth-hunting
expeditions. But in fact this image was created in the nineteenth century at a
time when hunting was no longer essential for survival, but was simply a
status symbol. In their interpretations of prehistory, archaeologists
neglected unspectacular types of food procurement such as gathering
berries and roots, or trapping small animals.
This is not to say that men did not sometimes slay a mammoth. But it
distorts the fact that they mainly collected berries. Here, the historians were
not objective, but confirmed the stereotype of men as brave fighters,
warriors and family breadwinners, as if this were a law of nature. Bottom
line: if you believe that you hold an objective opinion, ask yourself what
other points of view were excluded so that yours could prevail.If you want to make sure that every voice in the room is heard, you can ask
your team not to express their opinion about a given topic, but rather
brainstorm different possible opinions. That way sooner or later even the
unheard voices will appear on the flipchart and once they are up there, they
can be discussed.C O N C L U S I O NWhat we remember from a conversation
Here’s a question: how do we know if a presentation, a job interview or a
date went well?
We usually have a good hunch – but do we really know? Assessing a date
would involve some pretty complicated number crunching: we’d have to
calculate how we felt, how the other person felt, what we had expected and
so on. An impossible task.
It turns out our mind solves this problem by using a surprisingly simple
strategy, as Laurie Santos from Yale University explains brilliantly in a
lecture: when we remember something we ignore most of it. Actually we
make an assessment based only on two parts of the experience:
1. The peak – i.e. the part of the experience that was most extreme (either
pleasant or unpleasant).
2. The end – i.e. whether it got better or worse at the end. (This is
important: even a small improvement can make the date seem like an OK
experience, whereas a poor ending will ruin an otherwise great evening).
This is the Peak–End Rule, devised in a 1993 study by the Nobel laureate
Daniel Kahneman and his colleagues.
How can we use this in our life?
The Peak–End Rule gives us some hints about how to make an experience
special:
We often obsess about what kind of first impression we make on people,
fearing that people might judge us based only on our outward appearance or
first sentences. This thinking is based on the famous notion of ‘You only
have one chance to make a first impression.’ Though this holds true – the
first thing we hear about someone influences our judgement of that person,
the first price we are quoted forms the basis for the negotiation; it is the
anchor effect – maybe we should start obsessing about something else:
there might be only one chance to make a lasting impression. That lasting
impression is not necessarily the first impression, but rather the last one.(That is, by the way, the reason why we binge-watch TV shows: by ending
on a cliffhanger they have perfected the Peak–End Rule.)
So when it comes to communication, it is of course important how we
start a meeting, how we set the tone, how we break the ice. But, according
to Kahneman’s work, maybe we should start focusing on how we want to
end the whole damned thing.
‘I don’t care about opening sentences. All I care about is the last sentence.
It’s the sentence the reader will go to bed with.’
