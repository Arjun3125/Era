    "raw_text": "Introduction: We Need to Talk\nCommunication is a bit like love – it’s what makes the world go round, but\nnobody really knows how it works. Communication is something natural,\nsomething everyday even, yet most of us have only a vague notion of the\nrules that govern it. Day in, day out, we ask questions, read, explain, write,\nlisten, argue, discuss or hold our tongues. But only a few of us have the\nnecessary tools to improve the way we communicate or to understand how\nwe’re being communicated with. This was the starting point for our\nexploration of communication theory.\nFor this book we delved into some of the most important communication\ntheories, assessed their relevance, condensed them, simplified them in the\nform of diagrams, and applied them to modern-day challenges. We also\nenhanced them with practical tips and methods. The result: forty-four up-to-\ndate approaches for dealing with eternal problems, from relationships to job\ninterviews, fake news to the filter-bubble effect, small talk to the annual\npresentation.\nThis book is actually an exhibition, which came about as follows: the\nMuseum of Communication in Bern, Switzerland, contacted us and asked if\nwe could explain the most important theories in communication history in\ndiagrams. Until 2030 you can experience this book live in the museum.\n\f\nJ O B A N D C A R E E R"

    "raw_text": "How to influence people\nAn American psychologist, Dr Robert Cialdini, has devoted much of his\ncareer to one of the most basic and at the same time biggest questions\nwithin communication: when do people say yes? Or more explicitly: can we\nmake them say yes?\nCialdini identified six universal principles that explain how you can\npersuade someone to accept your suggestion:\n1. Reciprocity: this is basically the old biblical principle: Do unto others as\nyou would have them do unto you. Put into action: if you want to get\nsomething, give something. The right order is important: offer something\nfirst. Then ask for what you want.\n2. Authority: we tend to follow the advice of experts. We have more trust\nin a doctor who is wearing a white coat and displaying diplomas on the\nwall. Put into action: in your area of expertise, find out what the ‘white\ncoat’ is.\n3. Consistency: we look up to people who are consistent in their words and\nbehaviours. Put into action: stick to one message. Don’t follow every\ntrend. Be the consistent one, people will remember you for that.\n4. Consensus: we are herd people. We do what others do. This is called\n‘social proof’. Put into action: if you want someone to do something,\nshow others doing it (‘People who bought this book also bought …’).\n5. Scarcity: we all want that which is rare and we are all afraid to lose what\nwe have. Put into action: it might not be enough to talk about the benefits\nof your offer; you also need to point at what people will lose if they fail\nto act. This also holds true if people face change: they are usually scared\nof what they might lose. Therefore it’s good to tell them what they will\nlose if they fail to move.\n6. Liking: this is the most universal principle: people prefer to say yes to\npeople they like. But who do we like? According to Cialdini there are\nthree factors: we like people who are similar to us; we like people who\n\f\ncompliment us; we like people who cooperate with us towards a common\ngoal.\n‘Get in the habit of helping people out, and don’t say, “No big deal.” Say,\n“Of course; it’s what partners do for each other” – label what happened an\nact of partnership.’\nRobert Cialdini"

    "raw_text": "Why meetings take so long\nIt is one of the great mysteries of the modern world of work: why are\nmeetings so exhausting? And why do they take so long?\nAccording to Seth Godin, there are only three kinds of meetings:\n· Information: a meeting in which the participants are informed about\nsomething (whether they like it or not).\n· Discussion: a meeting which aims to give input or direction, or to receive\nfeedback.\n· Permission: a meeting in which one side proposes something, in the hope\nthat the other says yes (but has the right and the power to say no).\nWhat often makes meetings frustrating is the fact that different people\nmight think it’s a different kind of meeting. Here are some tips to make\nmeetings run more smoothly:\nThe fifteen-minute rule\nParkinson’s Law states that Work expands so as to fill the time available for\nits completion (and not according to how complex it really is). Therefore it\nmakes sense to limit the time of meetings. Incidentally, studies show that\nthe attention span of the average person is between ten and eighteen\nminutes. Ideally, you should use a timer. When it rings, the meeting is over\n– immediately.\nThe question rule\nThere are three types of question that you can ask in a meeting: first,\ncomprehension questions; second, questions to support the process (for\nexample, to make sure that everyone has really understood everything and\nis talking about the same thing); and, third, questions that show how much\nyou know, in order to underscore your own position or challenge another\nperson. All three types of question are legitimate, but they should not be\nmixed: first come comprehension questions, then questions about the\nprocess, then debate questions.\n\f\nThe standing rule\nIn many companies, meetings are held with everybody standing up because\nit leads to decisions being reached more quickly (see point 1). At\nWashington University, studies showed that when they are standing, people\nreact more readily with enthusiasm, whereas when they are sitting, they\ntend towards scepticism.\nThe smartphone rule\nNo smartphones during the meeting. Notes should be made by hand. Even\nthe White House supposedly followed this rule under Barack Obama.\nIf you want to call a family meeting, just turn off the WiFi router and wait\nin the room where it is located.\n\f\n\n\f\nHow to talk to your team\nClose your eyes for a moment and think about the best boss you ever had.\nNow think of the worst one. What set them apart?\nMost likely, your best boss not only achieved good results, but was also a\ngood communicator. Good bosses get the best out of their employees every\nday, or at least give them the feeling they are achieving their full potential.\nBut how do they do it? In the context of this book, the question is: How do\nyou communicate properly with your employees, with your team?\nObviously there can’t be a universal answer: every person, every\nsituation, every company, every relationship is different. At the same time\nwe all know that we should speak to our team the way we would like to be\nspoken to: considerately, directly, clearly. We’ve translated these adverbs\ninto rules.\n1. Don’t criticize\nThis might sound a bit too easy-going. And, of course, you have to evaluate\nthe work of your employees – that’s your job. But go easy on the criticism.\nOnly start deconstructing if you’re prepared to help with the rebuilding.\nKeep using ‘we’. Especially when your team has lost.\n2. Give praise (but not too much)\nGo easy on the compliments, otherwise they lose their effect. If you\ncelebrate behaviour that you expect, you are lowering standards. Whatever\nyou do, don’t give praise simply to please.\n3. Practise what you preach\nNothing rings more hollow than words that aren’t backed up by deeds. If\npunctuality and friendliness are important to you, then be punctual and\nfriendly. Set the pace, demonstrate values, establish the tone. But pick your\nbattles, only set standards that are important to you – or that you consider to\nbe generally important. You ought to be good at upholding standards that\nare important to you, and if there are standards that you regard as important"

    "raw_text": "but find hard to uphold, then you need to learn them yourself. Share this\nwith your employees. Nobody can be good at everything.\nAs a leader, get used to the idea that you are primarily responsible for the\nsupply of energy. In other words: motivating, advising, stabilizing,\nproviding momentum – and letting others shine.\n\f\n\n\f\nHow to carry through every idea\nMeetings are known to reveal a person’s character. Generally speaking,\nthere are four personality types in meetings:\n1. The silent type says nothing, is thereby usually proven right, and always\nthinks he or she knows better.\n2. The opportunist is enthusiastic about every suggestion, especially those\nmade or favoured by the boss.\n3. The ‘master of the obvious’ announces the obvious with great\nconviction, as if he or she had just thought it up.\n4. The nay-sayer’s purpose in life seems to be to pull apart other people’s\nsuggestions.\nSo how can you get a suggestion past these hellhounds? A particularly\neffective method seems to be the Salami Tactic. Do not put your suggestion\nforward all in one go, but serve it in small, easily digestible slices instead.\nThis portioning method has two advantages: first, the fear of a huge task or\nbold idea is reduced; second, a measured presentation allows the other\nparticipants to explore the idea themselves and think it through further.\nAnd, above all, this tactic does not allow the other participants to recognize\nyour overarching intention. This makes it harder to fight against it. If there\nare ideological rifts, it is better to take small, isolated steps and concentrate\non the matter at hand, not on the intended outcome.\nAnd what do you do if someone tries to salami you? Simply ask: ‘Is that\neverything?’ Keep on asking until everything is on the table. Only then start\nnegotiating, setting one slice of salami off against a slice of your own.\nThe origin of the term is unclear. Some sources say that in Hungary\nSzalámitaktika was the name given to the gradual takeover of power by the\nCommunist Party.\nDisassemble a truck into many small parts and a child can carry it."

    "raw_text": "How to make a good speech\nIn his definitive work Rhetoric, Aristotle wrote that a good speaker has to\nhave three things under control: the argument (logos), the presentation\n(ethos) and the audience (pathos). This may sound pompous, but it is just as\nvalid today as in ancient times.\nIn Aristotle’s day, there were only three different types of rhetoric: the\nfirst was judicial rhetoric, which dealt primarily with past events. Then\nthere was epideictic rhetoric, which typically celebrated a person in the\npresent (a typical example is a eulogy, which, Aristotle wrote, addresses the\nmourners rather than the dead). And, finally, there was deliberative rhetoric,\nsuch as political oratory, in which the speaker attempted to persuade the\naudience to carry out a certain action in the near future.\nAristotle, and later the Romans Cicero and Quintilian, established a\ncomplex five-point plan for writing brilliant speeches, which essentially\nboils down to this: you should put all the aces that you want to play up your\nsleeve in advance. Good preparation, in other words, is everything.\nAristotle considered rhetoric not as a tool to convince the audience, but\nas an art form to help present a persuasive argument. This was the end to\nwhich the speaker should employ rhetoric. Because people with good ideas\nare often poor speakers, he provided them with a toolbox full of rhetorical\nresources. So Aristotle was in fact the first person to prepare academics for\ntheir TED talks and keynotes. Below are six rhetorical tools:\n1. Anaphora: repetition of a word or phrase, typical in political speeches: ‘I\ndemand justice. I demand understanding. I demand …’\n2. Inversion: reversing the usual word order, such as in ‘Infinite is his\nsorrow’ (instead of ‘His sorrow is infinite’).\n3. Irony: saying one thing when you really mean the opposite, e.g. ‘I really\nenjoyed being stuck in that traffic jam.’\n4. Rhetorical questions: questions that make a statement, e.g. ‘Would you\nlike shiny, glossy hair?’\n5. Analogies (comparisons): ‘He stood there like a dying duck in a\nthunderstorm’ (banal) or ‘He was as confused as a comma at the end of a\nsentence’ (creative).\n\f\n6. Antithesis: a contrasting thought to produce tension, e.g. ‘He was\nbeautiful, strong and … unhappy.’\nIn practice, the same applies to presentations as to speeches: read through\nyour text aloud several times (one full sheet of A4 is about four minutes of\npresentation). Remember to integrate pauses. Look at your audience.\nBreathe deeply.\nA good speech is one that induces the listeners to change their minds, while\ngiving them the feeling that this change of opinion is their own decision."

    "raw_text": "How to make the most boring lecture exciting\nWhy do all fairy tales begin with the phrase ‘Once upon a time …’?\nThe answer is relevant for anyone who gives presentations: according to\nthe sociolinguist William Labov, if we weave hard facts into narrative\npatterns, associations with well-known fairy tales are evoked in our\nmemories which remind us of the pleasure of listening to them. With the\nconsequence that our attention span increases. Classic fairy tales follow a\nparticular sequence:\n· Abstract: how does it begin? (‘Once upon a time …’)\n· Orientation: who/where/when? (‘A king and queen had a daughter …’)\n· Complicating action: the problem to be solved (‘But all around the castle,\na hedge of thorns started to grow …’)\n· Resolution: solution (‘Then he stooped and kissed Sleeping Beauty. And\nshe opened her eyes for the first time in many, many years …’)\n· Evaluation: what results from it? (‘And they lived happily ever after.’)\n· Coda: what remains (‘And the moral of the story …’)\nA lecture should be structured along the same lines. The idea is not new.\nAristotle (see ‘Theory of Rhetoric’) was already aware of the importance of\nemotion in speech-making. And in 1984 the communication researcher\nWalter Fisher came up with a radical thesis: people do not want logical\narguments; they want good stories. Our life is not an Excel spreadsheet – it\nis a story with ups and downs. Fisher’s idea is summed up in his famous\n‘narrative paradigm’, which represents a break with classical rhetoric: we\ndo not evaluate a story on the basis of arguments, but on the basis of how\nmuch we trust or believe in the story (can I identify with the subject or the\npeople?) and its coherence (does the story make sense?).\nChris Anderson, the inventor of TED, says something similar about the\nthree rules for a perfect TED talk: 1. Don’t talk about a concept, a\ndeficiency or a product; talk about an idea. 2. Focus on just one idea. 3.\nTalk about the idea in such a way that people will want to tell others about\nit."

    "raw_text": "The next time you have to say something in front of other people, start your\ntalk with this sentence: ‘Let me tell you a short story …’ or ‘On the way\nhere, something strange happened to me …’\n\f\n\n\f\nHow to reach an agreement\nNegotiation is the fine art of finding a solution to an apparently impossible\nsituation. One of the best-known negotiating methods, ‘principled\nnegotiation’, is based on the book Getting to Yes by Roger Fisher and\nWilliam L. Ury.\nLet’s break down their strategy and apply it to real life: think about a\ncomplex situation – negotiating your salary with your boss, pocket money\nwith your children, a ransom demanded by a blackmailer – and try to apply\nthe following principles to the situation:\n· Thing, not person: do not be distracted by whether you like the other\nperson or not.\n· Similarities, not differences: don’t think: I am in the weaker [or stronger]\nnegotiating position. Ask yourself: What does the other person need from\nme? Do we have common interests?\n· Good enough, not perfect: you should not be aiming for the maximum\npossible. Because perfection is like the unicorn: it’s rumoured to exist, but\nnobody has ever seen it. So, alongside your desired outcome to the\nnegotiation, have a Plan B prepared before negotiations even start. This is\ncalled the BATNA Principle (Best Alternative to a Negotiated\nAgreement). It offers the best alternative when an agreement can’t be\nreached.\nThere are two schools of thought when it comes to negotiation: the first\nbelieves that you have to negotiate ‘hard’ and ‘conquer’ the other side (‘It’s\nnot enough to win, someone has to lose’); the other recommends\nnegotiating ‘softly’ in order not to put a strain on the relationship.\n‘Principled negotiation’ falls into the second camp and recommends\ncooperative negotiation. Negotiating properly means that everyone gets\nmore than they originally hoped for.\n‘You must never try to make all the money that’s in a deal. Let the other\nfellow make some money too, because if you have a reputation for always\nmaking all the money, you won’t have many deals.’\n\f\nJ. Paul Getty"

    "raw_text": "How to criticize\nFeedback is one of the most sensitive processes in communication. It is\neasy to hurt people with criticism, but false compliments are also unhelpful.\nHarsh criticism damages our self-esteem and can lead us to make unwise\nchoices, but flowery compliments often make us too complacent.\nAs for the person giving the feedback: most people are prone to being\ncritical, as it gives them a feeling of superiority. They feel like they need to\ncrush bad or weird ideas.\nFeedback can be analysed along two axes: it can be negative or positive\nand constructive or destructive. So this gives us four different types of\nfeedback.\n1. ‘No’ – negative, destructive feedback: you are simply told the idea is\nbad without being given an explanation or offered an alternative. While\nthis can be at times an effective feedback it seldom changes the\nbehaviour of the receiver.\n2. ‘No, because …’ – negative, constructive feedback: you are told you’re\nwrong and then you are presented with the correct answer. This is how\nold-school teaching works.\n3. ‘Yeah, but …’ – positive, destructive feedback: most managers have\nsooner or later heard about the importance of giving positive feedback.\nSo they start off by saying something positive about your idea, just to\ndeconstruct it afterwards and offer a contrary opinion (‘The idea is good,\nbut …’).\n4. ‘Yes, and …’ – the appreciative response: try to find the one thing in\nthe proposal that works and build on that. This goes back to ‘appreciative\ninquiry’, a method attributed to an American, David Cooperrider, that\ninvolves concentrating on the strengths, positive attributes and potential\nof a company or a person, rather than weaknesses. According to this\ntheory, focusing too strongly on the flaws of an idea or project stifles the\nopen and positive approach that is essential for good working practices.\n\f\nCareful: of course, we sometimes have to deliver crystal-clear or even harsh\nfeedback. But the point is, people learn better if they are offered\nconstructive feedback. We know this from brainstorming sessions where the\nflow and fun increase the more positive the exchange. Collaboration, it\nseems, dies when the response is negative and ideas are killed before they\nare explored.\nWhenever you are about to give feedback, ask yourself: ‘How can I make\nthis idea better?’ rather than ‘Why is this idea bad?’\n\f\n\n\f\nWhat happens when everyone has the same opinion\nFor a long time it was common knowledge that group decision making was\nbetter than individual decision making. Even today we often celebrate\ncollaborations, consensual decisions and teamwork.\nHowever, as early as 1972 a Yale psychologist, Irving Janis, pointed out\nin a spectacular, radical paper that sometimes also groups make very bad\ndecisions. Janis had studied such debacles as Pearl Harbor or the Vietnam\nWar. And what he found was that these groups had rejected critical opinions\nand outside information.\nIn the warmth of a like-minded group people reassure themselves that\nthey are right, that their analysis is superior to that of outsiders, that their\nconsensus is a sign of the strength of the group, when in fact they have been\nlooking only for evidence that confirmed their objectives. And any doubts\nin the room were silenced because if everyone seems enthusiastic and\nagrees with the plan, we will feel reluctant to speak up – even if we have\nserious doubts. This, by the way, seems to be one of the governing\nprinciples of Donald Trump’s leadership strategy: surround yourself with\nyes-sayers.\nJanis called the phenomenon that occurs when the desire for group\nconsensus is stronger than the urge to express an unpopular opinion\n‘Groupthink’. If this happens, the group is at risk of making very poor\ndecisions. And even more: if many people are too sure of the same thing,\nthey become radical and imprudent. Researchers have observed this\nphenomenon among jury members: the greater the consensus, the harsher\nthe judgement, and the surer the jury is that its verdict is correct.\nWhen does groupthink occur?\nTypically, when there is:\n· High group cohesiveness\n· High pressure to make a good decision\n· Strong, persuasive, directive leadership\nHow can we avoid groupthink?\n\f\nJanis suggested several steps for preventing groupthink. Here are two great\nrecommendations if you are the leader of a team:\n1. ‘Give a high priority to airing objections and doubts.’ In other words:\nencourage all group members to speak their mind. Even and especially if\nthe opinion is unpopular.\n2. Divide your team into two and form competing teams to study the same\nproblem. Compare results.\n‘When all think alike, no one is thinking.’\nWalter Lippmann\n\f\n\n\f\nWhen the force is with you\nMost theories in this book argue that good communication has to do with\ncooperation. But in reality it’s sometimes a different story. It is no\ncoincidence that the book The 48 Laws of Power, a compilation of classic\npower strategies by the American author Robert Greene, was a bestseller.\nBorrowing from this book, here are some negotiating strategies that won’t\nmake you popular, but might help you come out on top. (Warning: even if\nyou prefer to convince people with good arguments rather than by mean\ntactics, you should know these tricks because they are bound to be used\nagainst you.)\nNever argue hesitantly\nIf you are unsure about something, try not to show it to others. Doubt and\nhesitation will only dilute your arguments. With ‘for and against’\nformulations, your adversary will see an opportunity to pounce. So only\nspeak up when you’re sure you want to follow through your argument, and\nstand your ground – even if your plan is flawed. We forgive bold people\ntheir mistakes, but have no confidence in doubters.\nTalk less\nCounterintuitively, you should not try to convince the other person by\ntalking a lot. The more you talk, the more interchangeable and ordinary\nyour arguments seem. Every triumph that you achieve through words is in\nreality a pyrrhic victory, because nobody likes to be argued into a corner.\nAct ignorant\nWe tend to be dazzled by intelligence and charisma. Try the opposite: make\nyour adversary feel clever. He or she will be flattered and become\ninattentive. When your opponent’s guard drops, you can attack. Acting\nstupid is one of the oldest stratagems around. As they say in China:\n‘Masquerade as a pig to kill the tiger.’"

A smiling confession of your own defeat comes\nacross as more self-assured than sullenness. And, what’s more, the less\ninterest you show, the less satisfied your adversary will feel.\n‘Oysters open completely when the moon is full; and when the crab sees\none it throws a piece of stone or seaweed into it and the oyster cannot close\nagain, so that it serves the crab for meat. Such is the fate of him who opens\nhis mouth too much and thereby puts himself at the mercy of the listener.’\nLeonardo da Vinci\n\f\n\n\f\nHow to negotiate abroad\n‘There was once a Finn who loved his wife so much that he almost told\nher.’ It’s a joke, and yet not a joke. Because many Finns are indeed\nintroverted, taciturn people.\nAnyone who has come into contact with other cultures knows that\nstereotypes and prejudices can’t always be trusted (the Scots are frugal, the\nSwiss are punctual, the Finns are introverted), but that they do often contain\na germ of truth. Or, to put it another way, you might say that while many\nclichés are true, the more you get to know a culture, the more black and\nwhite turns to grey.\nIn order to get to grips with a culture it is not enough to master the\nlanguage, as cultural idiosyncrasies are more apparent in the way we\ncommunicate than in what we communicate. What is required is so-called\n‘intercultural communication’. The term was coined by the Dutch social\npsychologist Geert Hofstede, while its most famous proponent is the British\nlinguist Richard D. Lewis. In his classic book When Cultures Collide\n(2005), he defines three main cultural types: the linear-active, the multi-\nactive and the reactive:\n1.

    "raw_text": "How to (de)motivate ourselves\nThere are two kinds of self-talk: the first is the unselfconscious babbling of\nlittle children as they play or the thinking aloud of contestants in TV shows\nsuch as Who Wants to be a Millionaire? These types of inner monologue\nwere called ‘egocentric speech’ by the developmental psychologist Jean\nPiaget. He believed they were a sign of cognitive immaturity. Today, we\nknow that thinking aloud is an excellent method for ordering our thoughts\nand improving concentration.\nThe second type of self-talk is the inner dialogue. We comment on our\nown behaviour in a similar way to a sports commentator reporting on events\nduring a football match (the only difference being that the footballers can’t\nhear the comments, whereas we constantly have our ‘internal moderator’ in\nour ear). In the field of psychology, this is considered to be a healthy form\nof self-evaluation. However, a distinction is made between positive and\nnegative self-talk:\nNegative self-talk typically contains one of these thoughts:\n· Generalization: ‘I have already been left twice – people will always leave\nme.’\n· Rash conclusions: ‘Why doesn’t she call? I think she doesn’t like me.’\n· Self-blame: ‘I should have done differently’ or ‘I’m a bad father.’\nPositive self-talk is about breaking through the above negative patterns of\nthought. It’s not about convincing yourself that life is great, but rather about\nfreeing yourself from a cycle of negative thinking. For example, if you say:\n‘I’ll never manage it’, ask yourself instead: ‘What can I do in order to\nmanage it?’\nIn a nutshell: self-talk serves two different functions: first, concentration;\nand, second, motivation.\n‘[Talking to myself] is the only way I can be sure of intelligent\nconversation.’\n‘Edmund Blackadder’\n\f\n\n\f\nHow we are (not always) all ears\nParadoxically, in our age of constant communication, the raw material of\nconversation has actually disappeared: listening. Genuine, real listening is a\nrare commodity and a great gift, because you are giving to the person you\nare listening to your most valuable asset: your attention.\nHere are a few suggestions of how to do it right, based on the\ncommunication technique ‘active listening’ devised by Carl Rogers and\nRichard Farson in 1957.\nListen, don’t talk\nAs the cartoon here suggests, resist talking about yourself. Or as the radio\nhost Celeste Headlee put it brilliantly in a TEDx speech: ‘If they’re talking\nabout having lost a family member, don’t start talking about the time you\nlost a family member. If they’re talking about the trouble they’re having at\nwork, don’t tell them about how much you hate your job. It’s not the same.\nIt’s never the same. All experiences are individual. And, more importantly,\nit’s not about you.’\nDon’t finish the other person’s …\nSome people have a tendency of impatiently finishing the sentence or\nthought of the person they are talking to. Although very slow thinking and\ntalking can be irritating, don’t interrupt, even if you think it might show\nempathy.\nYour body language says a lot\nLook the other person in the eye – but don’t stare. Nod – but only if you\nwant to agree with what they are saying or show that you have understood\nsomething important.\nNotice the little things\nListen out for details in what they are saying and pick up on these later.\nThis makes it easier to ask questions (‘You mentioned that you spent a lot"

    "raw_text": "of time as a child at your grandmother’s – what kind of relationship did you\nhave with her?’). And it lets the other person know that you were really\nlistening.\nBe a friend, not a judge\nResist the impulse of giving the other person advice – unless of course they\nspecifically ask for it. Instead, take the conversation back to an exciting,\nimportant part of the story: ‘Earlier, you said that …’ Take the person away\nfrom the smooth surface to deeper levels: ‘How was it for you, when you\n…?’ Or encourage the person to keep talking by simply asking: ‘And what\nhappened next?’\n‘The most romantic gift: to listen to another’s anxieties for one hour,\nwithout judgement or “solutions”, as an analyst might.’\nAlain de Botton\n\f\n\n\f\nHow to start a conversation with strangers\nSmall talk is actually something very big. Those who manage to start a\nconversation with strangers, break the ice and treat them like friends have\nthe world at their feet (see ‘proust’s Questionnaire’). But it’s incredibly\ndifficult. There has been little serious research into the art of small talk and\nthere are few reliable theories, but, nonetheless, here are some practical tips.\nAsk for advice\nPeople love giving advice. So, start your small talk with a request for\nadvice: ‘I want to buy a smartphone [or a cocktail or a book], but I can’t\ndecide which one.’ Most people will happily open up. Then thank them for\nthe tip and the other person will feel like a fireman who has successfully\nextinguished a fire. The psychology behind this: if you ask for advice, you\ncreate intimacy: intimacy makes rejection difficult. Therefore, if you want\nto influence someone, it is a good idea to ask that person for advice first.\nAsk a second question\nWe often ask something and then wait for the other person to ask something\nback. This is not a conversation. Instead, use the old reporter trick and ask a\nsecond question. If you just asked ‘Where did you grow up?’, then a good\nfollow-up question might be: ‘How has that place shaped you?’\nDon’t ask: ‘What do you do for a living?’\nThere are two kinds of people: those who like to talk about their job and go\non and on about it; and those who are ashamed of their job, hate it or don’t\nhave one. The latter are reluctant to talk about this topic. The author\nGretchen Rubin suggests this simple but powerful tweak to the usual ‘What\ndo you do for a living?’ job question: ‘What’s keeping you busy these\ndays?’ Now the other person can choose what to talk about.\nDon’t start a conversation about things that interest you\n\f\nMost people like to talk about themselves. This leads to us not listening any\nmore, but simply waiting for our turn to speak. But a conversation is not a\nPowerPoint presentation. Don’t pitch your topics. Rather be the one person\nin the group who is interested in the other person’s topics. As Bill Nye put\nit: ‘Everyone you’ll ever meet knows something that you don’t.’\nListen\nThe way people deal with you depends on how you present yourself:\narrogant, worldly-wise or dull posturing brings out the same behaviour in\nyour counterpart. The supreme rule when making small talk comes from the\nradio host Celeste Headlee: ‘Enter every conversation assuming that you\nhave something to learn.’ People forget what they talked about with you,\nbut not how they felt in your presence.\n‘We have two ears and only one mouth so that we can listen twice as much\nas we speak.’\nEpictetus\n\f\n\n\f\nWhat happens below the surface\nOne of the most frequently cited and simplest but also most inscrutable of\nall communication theories is the Iceberg Theory.\nSigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, believed that human\nbehaviour is governed above all by the unconscious – like an iceberg, where\nonly the tip protrudes from the water, while the usually much bigger and\nmostly invisible part is below the surface. (At this point, it should be\nmentioned that we do not know for sure who came up with this brilliant\nmetaphor – it certainly wasn’t Freud; some say it was Hemingway, who in\nthe 1930s claimed that an author does not have to explicitly reveal the\ndeeper meaning of a story (see ‘The Six-Word Rule’). It is sufficient if, like\nan iceberg, only a tenth is visible above water.\nIf we apply this rule to communication, we could say that the visible,\nconscious part of a discussion is the factual level (what we say or what we\ntalk about), while the unconscious part is the interpersonal level (how we\nsay it and what we really mean) – see ‘Lasswell’s Communication Model’\nand ‘Watzlawick’s Axiom Theory’. This means we can control the factual\nlevel, we can select our words consciously, but our gestures, facial\nexpression and tone of voice will betray our unconscious secret hopes,\nrepressed conflicts, traumatic experiences, base motives and animal\ninstincts, and appeal to the other person’s unconscious. The interpersonal\nlevel decides how we will be perceived and how we perceive others.\nThe more we know about another person’s values, patterns of behaviour,\nmotives – in other words, the more we see of the iceberg – the better we can\nunderstand the person’s words and actions. The best way to ‘lower the\nwaterline’ of your opponent or partner is to show more of yourself. If you,\nfor example, want someone to admit something, start by talking honestly\nabout your own mistakes.\n‘Fear and hope are alike underneath.’\nRichard Ford\n\f\n\n\f\nWhy we don’t dare state our opinion\nLet us assume that you have a five-hour train ride ahead of you, and in your\ncrowded compartment a person starts talking about tightening the asylum\nlaws. Would you like to talk to this person or not?\nThis is the ‘railway test’, which the German social scientist Elisabeth\nNoelle-Neumann used to examine who sticks up for their opinion in public\nand who doesn’t. Her hypothesis: the willingness of people to voice their\nopinion in public dwindles in situations where they believe that the majority\nopinion is different from their own. In other words, we do not like to be of a\ndifferent opinion to others. If we notice that the group majority has a\ndifferent opinion to ours, we remain silent. This phenomenon is called the\n‘spiral of silence’ and can be explained by these six points, of which the last\ntwo are arguably the most important:\n1. Most people have a fear of isolation and observe the behaviour of others\nto assess which opinions will be accepted or rejected. ‘We fear isolation\nmore than being wrong,’ wrote Alexis de Tocqueville in the nineteenth\ncentury.\n2. We exert pressure on each other: we pull a face, roll our eyes or turn\naway when someone says something that does not comply with the\nprevailing opinion.\n3. Fear of isolation and a pressure to conform occur unconsciously. We do\nnot think about the extent to which we are guided by public opinion.\n4. We tend to conceal our opinion if we think that it will expose us to group\npressure. If we feel public support, however, we tend to express our\nopinion loudly and clearly.\n5. If consensus on a subject prevails in a group, it is unlikely that a spiral of\nsilence will begin.\n6. The number of people who share an opinion is not necessarily\nsignificant. A minority opinion can appear to be a majority opinion if its\nproponents appear confident enough and represent their opinion in public\nforcefully.\n\f\nWe become quieter if we believe that we are in the minority.\n\f\n\n\f\nHow words can trigger actions\nYou can do an incredible amount with words. How to Do Things with Words\nis also the name of the well-known book by the British philosopher J. L.\nAustin from 1962, in which he substantiated ‘language theory’.\nHe argued that in day-to-day life we distinguish between ‘doing’ and\n‘talking’ but that there is in fact no difference. Speaking is also an action.\nHis thesis: sentences have a ‘propositional’ meaning (this is the information\ncontained in the sentence), which can be ‘true’ or ‘false’. But sentences also\nhave an ‘illocutionary’ meaning. This means that we are doing something\nwhen we speak, including something essential (‘doing something in saying\nsomething’). Examples include requests, warnings, threats,\nrecommendations. Such an illocution can succeed or fail – for example, if\nyou don’t take the speaker seriously, the act of speaking has failed. Then\nthere is a third dimension, the perlocution. Here it is about the extent to\nwhich whatever was said has consequences – so whether the person being\naddressed acts on what is said or has a change of mind because of it (‘doing\nsomething by saying something’).\nLet’s take an example. If you say to a couple who happen to be sitting\nnext to you: ‘I hereby declare you husband and wife’, then the ‘proposition’\nis the same as what a vicar would say at a marriage ceremony in a church.\nThe difference: the sentence is just words. But spoken by a vicar the\nsentence has weight and effect; it is ‘illocutionary’ and seals the marriage.\nAnd with a bit of luck it is also perlocutionary, if the married couple stick to\ntheir vows in future. The sentence of the vicar thereby triggers subsequent\nactions.\nThe Speech Act Theory explained in two sentences: ‘What do we do when\nwe speak? What impact do we have when we speak?’\n\f\n\n\f\nWhich of our opinions never change\nA question that continues to preoccupy researchers into communication is\nthis: when do people allow themselves to be persuaded about something\nand when not? Why is it that some of our attitudes are deeply ingrained and\nnot up for discussion (e.g. allegiance to a particular football club), while we\nchange others at the drop of a hat (favourite TV series, for example)?\nAn explanation is offered by the Social Judgement Theory. According to\nthis theory, there are three factors that play a role in persuading us to change\nour opinion:\n1. The anchor point: this is our basic preferred attitude. This attitude is\nhard to budge, and we are unlikely to change it, regardless of what\ninformation we are given. So, for example, if we were to discover that\nthe players of our favourite football team were manipulating games, we\nmight be shocked, but it wouldn’t put an end to our long love affair.\n2. Room for manoeuvre: here it is about which alternative attitudes we\nfind acceptable, regardless of our own. These are attitudes that we can\naccept without having to hoist our anchor. This approach can lead to a\nchange of opinion in the long term.\n3. Ego involvement: the most complicated part: what does our ego have to\nsay? Take the death penalty, for example, which clearly contradicts the\nanchor point ‘human rights’, leaving little room for manoeuvre. But it is\nconceivable that if we were personally affected by a murder, we might\nfeel vengeful towards the perpetrator and change our mind, at least\nbriefly.\nThe stronger our anchor, i.e. our firm position on an issue, the harder it is\nto be persuaded by a different opinion. The stronger you pull at another\nperson’s anchor, the stronger their resistance. (How can you can succeed\nanyway? See ‘Six Principles of Persuasion’.)\nIf you can’t change your mind, then you’re not using it."

    "raw_text": "How to apologize properly so that the other person forgives and\nforgets\nApologizing is one of the most difficult interpersonal communication\nsituations. A few years ago, a team of researchers from Ohio State\nUniversity tackled this issue and played through a variety of approaches.\nWe translate their findings into strategies:\nUse ‘I’ sentences\nApologizing means taking on full responsibility for something. Sentences\nlike ‘I’m sorry that your feelings were hurt’, or ‘I’m sorry that you’re so\nangry’, should be avoided (because what you’re implying is: it doesn’t have\nanything to do with me that your feelings are hurt). Say it like it is: ‘I’m\nsorry that I hurt your feelings.’ According to the research, a person is most\nlikely to forgive and forget if you admit full responsibility for what you did.\nDon’t justify your actions\nIt is a natural reflex to try to justify your own actions. But also an idiotic\none. Because a justification is in effect a denial of the apology. The\nfollowing sentences are particularly counterproductive: ‘Come on, it wasn’t\nthat bad!’ or ‘I can’t help it.’ The injured person will be more inclined to\nforgive if you come up with a reason rather than a justification: try to\nexplain your action without being defensive. Most effective of all are an\nexplanation and an admission of guilt combined.\nAvoid ‘but’ sentences\nAn apology in which the word ‘but’ crops up is almost never understood as\nan apology but as an excuse. Avoid at all costs.\nDon’t ask for forgiveness\nAsking for forgiveness is rarely effective. According to the research, you\ncan spare yourself the bother. Nobody likes to grant absolution.\n\f\nChange yourself\nEven the most honest apology is worthless if you repeat the same mistake\nthree times. Making an apology is above all a commitment to making a\nchange and an offer to make amends.\nWhen it comes to apologies, keep in mind there are only two ways: you can\napologize begrudgingly or sincerely. Choose the latter.\n\f\n\n\f\nHow to answer the question: ‘How do I look?’\nThe truth is, all people lie. In certain situations – such as when we are under\npressure, have to justify ourselves, or want to make a good impression – we\ntend more towards fibbing and telling tales than when we feel relaxed and\nself-secure. But, from an ethical point of view, not every lie is bad. You\nmight, for example, lie in order to protect someone. In communication\ntheory, lies fall into two categories: do I benefit from the lie or does the\nperson I lied to benefit? This results in four different outcomes.\n1. White lie – only the person lied to benefits: this is a fine, selfless lie in\nwhich you risk potential loss to help someone out. Here, you typically\nput yourself in the position of the person and, for example, defend the\nexistence of Santa Claus in the knowledge that the lie will be exposed in\ndue time. This altruistic lie gives us a good feeling.\n2. Grey lie – both the liar and the person lied to benefit: ‘You’ve lost\nweight!’ Grey lies are often part of cultural norms. In many situations,\nwhen you ask: ‘How are you?’, you expect a lie in response: ‘Thank you,\nthings are great!’\n3. Black lie – only the liar benefits: although you are guilty, you reject all\naccusations: ‘No, I didn’t take the money!’ It is often also a bold\npromise, a proactive lie: ‘If I am elected I will never raise taxes …’ Here,\nbare-faced lying is used to your own advantage.\n4. Red lie – no one benefits: this is the lowest form of lying. Saying\nsomething with complete awareness that the other person knows the\nstatement to be false, even if you sometimes end up also inflicting\ndamage on yourself: ‘The largest audience ever to witness an\ninauguration.’\n‘If you tell the truth, you don’t have to remember anything.’\nMark Twain"

Ernest\nHemingway was sitting having a drink with some writer friends at\nLüchow’s restaurant in New York. They were talking about this and that,\nand eventually moved on to what the ideal length of a good novel might be.\nHemingway claimed that he could write a novel in six words: the others\neach bet ten dollars that he couldn’t. Whereupon Hemingway wrote: ‘For\nsale: baby shoes, never worn’ on a napkin. Six words, behind which lies a\ntragedy. Those who don’t gulp when they read this must have hearts of\nstone.\nIn 2006, Larry Smith, founder and editor of SMITH magazine, asked:\n‘Can you tell your life story in six words?’\nA dumped 27-year-old guy wrote: ‘I still make coffee for two.’ ‘Cursed\nwith cancer. Blessed with friends’ came from a nine-year-old cancer\nsurvivor. The singer Moby confessed: ‘Dad died, mom crazy, me, too.’ And\nGeorge Saunders summed life up beautifully: ‘Started small, grew, peaked,\nshrunk, vanished.’\nSmith’s formal restriction proved not to be limiting but stimulating, and\nin the spirit of the pithy language used in social media, the logic of the 140-\ncharacter tweet and the compulsive succinctness of texts, six-word memoirs\nbecame a hit.\nThe thinking behind the abbreviated form: language is beautiful, and its\ndiversity and complexity are a reflection of the depth of human sensibility.\nBut it is also an excellent tool with which to beat around the bush. The Six-\nWord Rule is not a rejection of sprawling, convoluted sentences or endless\ndigressions; even Hemingway was of the opinion that not every idea can be\npared down. But before writing (or speaking), you should ask yourself these\nquestions: What do I really want to say and can I say it more succinctly?\nIf it’s important, keep it short."

    "raw_text": "L O V E A N D F R I E N D S H I P\n\f\n\n\f\nHow relationships fail\nAn axiom is a valid truth that needs no proof. At the end of the 1960s, the\ncommunication theorist Paul Watzlawick, together with other researchers,\ncame up with five axioms to explain how interpersonal communication –\nespecially in relationships – fails.\n1. You cannot not communicate\nA man comes home, sits down, stares into space and is silent. His wife\nlooks at him and asks him how he is. He says nothing – and yet he\ncommunicates something. It is immediately clear that something must have\nhappened. Even if you say nothing, you are saying something.\n2. All communication has a relationship aspect and a content aspect\nThe content aspect is what we say. The relationship aspect includes how we\nsay things, but also who says something (see ‘Schulz von Thun’s\nCommunication Model’). Who says something and how it is said always\nweigh heavier than what is said. If we are offended by a complete stranger,\nit affects us less than if our partner offends us. Also keep in mind Albert\nMehrabian’s 7%–38%–55% Rule. If we are talking to someone about our\nfeelings, this is the impact our words, tone of voice and body language\nhave: our words are 7 per cent, our tone of voice 38 per cent and our body\nlanguage 55 per cent responsible for whether that person likes us.\n3. Communication is always about cause and effect\nA woman is annoyed because her partner is grumbling. The man is\ngrumbling because the woman is annoyed. In other words: we seldom\nquarrel with ourselves – it will always take two to tango.\n4. Human communication makes use of analogue and digital modalities\nIn Watzlawick’s terms, ‘digital’ means verbally and ‘analogue’ means non-\nverbally – in other words, eye-rolling, a smug smile, ambiguous intonation.\nIf the two levels do not correlate, then we’re not on the same page.\n\f\n5. Communication is symmetric or complementary\nRelationships between partners are either symmetrical (equal) or\ncomplementary (unequal). Symmetric means that we talk at eye level (in\nthe relationship); complementary means that there is a kind of hierarchy\n(for example, between teacher and pupil). If we do not agree whether the\ncommunication is complementary or symmetrical, it becomes problematic.\nEveryone hears what you say. Friends listen to what you say. Best friends\nlisten to what you don’t say.\n\f\n\n\f\nHow to ask good questions\nIn the late nineteenth century, light conversation (or ‘small talk’ in modern\nEnglish – see ‘Small Talk’) was crucial to the success of an evening. Being\nrefined was not about saying the right thing without having to think too\nhard, nor was it about getting the other person to laugh at one’s charming,\nwitty remarks. Instead, the ideal neighbour at a dinner party was the one\nwho had mastered the fine art of asking questions. The explanation for this\nis simple, and truthful, and can be summed up with this rule: we do not\nappreciate those who are brilliant, but those who make us feel brilliant.\nBut because it is extremely difficult to ask the right question in the right\nsituation, a small crib sheet soon circulated around European salons. It\nconsisted of questions that seemed innocent but which bared the soul, such\nas ‘Who would you prefer to be?’, ‘How would you like to die?’ and\n‘Which characteristics do you most appreciate in a man?’ The author of the\nquestionnaire remains unknown to this day. In 1885, Marcel Proust (then\nonly thirteen years old) answered the questionnaire at his friend Antoinette\nFaure’s birthday party. In 1924, Faure’s son published Proust’s answers;\nsince then it has been known as ‘Proust’s Questionnaire’. The fact that he\ndidn’t invent it, but simply filled it in, speaks in favour of the charm of the\nabove rule.\nProust’s questions have three key qualities:\n1. They are open questions that you cannot answer with yes or no.\n2. The questions require no prior knowledge; in other words, there are no\nright or wrong answers, only honest ones.\n3. They are questions that centre on your counterpart rather than on you.\nWe all admire people who give good answers. But we admire those who ask\ngood questions even more. The people we remember most are the ones who\nreally listen."

    "raw_text": "Why we find it difficult to be friendly\nPsychologists generally agree that conflicts need to be dealt with, but the\nquestion is: how? The American psychologist Marshall B. Rosenberg\n(1934–2015) developed the idea of nonviolent communication based on the\npremise that it’s not what you say, but how you say it. He distinguishes\nbetween speaking snappishly, ‘language of the jackal’, and speaking from\nthe heart, ‘language of the giraffe’ (giraffes have the biggest heart of any\nland animal). This may sound like mumbo jumbo, but it comes closer to\nreality than most management jargon. The language of the jackal causes the\nspeaker to feel superior and the person being addressed to feel bad. Typical\nexamples of jackal language:\n· Analysis: ‘That’s wrong, because …’\n· Criticism: ‘The mistake you made was that you …’\n· Interpretations: ‘You do that because …’\n· Appraisals: ‘You’re smart/lazy, you’re right/wrong …’\n· Threats: ‘If you don’t do it immediately, I’ll have to …’\nAccording to Rosenberg, statements like these are ‘desires in disguise’.\nBecause we have not learned to ask for something politely or to express our\nwishes constructively, we resort to aggressive language. And aggression\nleads to counter-aggression or submissive subjugation.\nGiraffe language, on the other hand, works like this:\n· Observe without evaluating: ‘You always look out of the window when I\nwant to talk to you.’\n· Acknowledge and define your own or others’ feelings: ‘I’m worried.’\n· Acknowledge needs and take them seriously: ‘I want to know how you’re\ndoing.’\n· Express clear and achievable objectives based on these needs: ‘Please tell\nme what you need, so that we can talk about it.’\nBut why is it so difficult to be friendly? Often, we ourselves are the\nproblem. Take the so-called ‘attribution error’: if we arrive late, there was a\n\f\nlot of traffic. If others arrive late, they set off too late (or for people with a\nnegative frame of mind, the other way round). We are by nature prone to\npass judgement, and what’s more, it is easier to blame someone else than to\nthink about why something happened.\nThe essence of normal communication: we all like to be right. The essence\nof nonviolent communication: we are better off if we resolve a dispute than\nif we win it. Or in the words of Marshall Rosenberg: ‘Would you rather be\nright … or happy …?’\n\f\n\n\f\nHow we should express ourselves in order to be understood\nPeople’s three biggest fears: loving someone without being loved in return;\nsearching for friends and not finding any; saying something and not being\nunderstood. There is no solution to the first two. For the third there is at\nleast a principle. The British philosopher Paul Grice (1913–88) dedicated\nhis life to this problem and in 1975 finally formulated the so-called\nCooperative Principle, a basic rule for effective communication:\n‘Make your conversational contribution such as is required, at the stage\nat which it occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange\nin which you are engaged.’\nYou might be thinking that Grice could have done with some language\ntraining himself, but let’s take a closer look at what the Cooperative\nPrinciple is actually all about. According to Grice, speaker and listener want\nto (and have to) behave cooperatively. This means that one person wants to\nbe understood, the other to understand. In order for this to work, Grice\nproposed four conversational maxims:\n1. Maxim of quantity: say enough for your counterpart to understand, but\ndon’t say too much, or you will cause confusion.\n2. Maxim of quality: tell the truth, don’t speculate, don’t dupe the person\ninto believing something different.\n3. Maxim of relevance: don’t say anything irrelevant, don’t change the\nsubject.\n4. Maxim of manner: avoid ambiguity, vagueness, verbosity and volatility,\nand stick to a logical argument.\nIf we follow these maxims, then, as a general rule, we will be understood.\nBut what happens if we don’t follow them, which is the case in most of our\nconversations?\n· We can violate the maxims without being noticed. That’s called ‘lying’.\n(‘Did you wreck the car?’ ‘No, I didn’t’ – although you did.)\n· We can violate the maxims deliberately by saying something else but\nexpecting the listener to understand the message correctly. That’s called\n\f\n‘flouting’. (A typical form is irony: you look out of the window to see the\nstorm intensify. You then turn to your friend and say: ‘What wonderful\nweather!’)\n· We can refrain from cooperation. That’s called ‘opting out’. (If you say:\n‘My lips are sealed’, this implies you know something, but won’t talk\nabout it and this will end all communication.)\nOnly say what is true and important, and express it clearly and simply.\n\f\n\n\f\nHow much distance we keep from other people\nPerhaps you know the feeling: you’re sitting in the cinema, the film hasn’t\nstarted yet, the auditorium is barely a third full, and several rows are\ncompletely empty. Someone comes in, looks around, walks past the empty\nseats – and sits down right next to you! The feeling that you now have is\ncalled ‘expectancy violation’. You expected something different – that the\nperson would find an empty seat, not one right next to you. In 1985, the\nAmerican Judee Burgoon developed the Expectancy Violations Theory,\nwhich analyses how our expectations of another person affect the way we\nrespond to unanticipated violations of these expectations or social norms.\nAccording to Burgoon, the following rules apply in the Western world with\nregard to keeping our distance:\n1. Intimate space (elbow room): up to 50 cm. Within this space, we expect\nto be touched by the other person. It is reserved for close family, lovers\nand pets.\n2. Personal space: 50–120 cm. The typical distance we keep from\nsomebody we are talking to.\n3. Social space: 120–360 cm. The distance we keep from people we do not\nknow, with whom we do not communicate, but whom we have nothing\nagainst.\n4. Public space: 360 cm or more. This distance is best explained if we ask\nourselves: which people do we avoid?\nOf course, it is not only about distance, but also about physical and eye\ncontact. If someone turns away from us while we are speaking, it violates\nour expectations of the conversation. This is most easily observed in\nromantic relationships, where the usage of smartphones and social media is\nfor many a strong sign of divided attention and a source for trouble.\nThe distance we keep is also influenced by cultural and situational\nnorms. Different distance rules apply to dancing in a club and studying in a\nlibrary. In Switzerland, people greet one another with three little kisses; in\nthe USA, this would be regarded as too close for comfort.\n\f\nWhen in Rome, do as the Romans do."

    "raw_text": "Why we should talk to each other about how we talk to each other\nIt’s an archetypal misunderstanding: A couple are sitting in a car and the\ntraffic lights turn green without the driver noticing. The passenger says: ‘It’s\ngreen.’ The driver replies testily: ‘Am I driving or you?’\nThis example comes from Friedemann Schulz von Thun. His\n‘communication square’ does not count as a theory in the narrower sense,\nbut it breaks down the many pitfalls of communication in a clearer way than\nother approaches. According to Thun, every message has four layers:\n1. Content (what I am informing myself about).\n2. Appeal (what I want to achieve).\n3. Relationship (my relationship to the receiver).\n4. Self-disclosure (what I show of myself).\nOur example contains the content layer (‘The traffic light is green’), the\nappeal layer (‘Come on, drive!’), an allusion to the relationship (the\npassenger wants to help the driver) and the self-disclosure layer (the\npassenger is probably in a hurry). These are the four facets of the sender’s\nmessage.\nThe person receiving the message – in this case, the driver – does so with\nhis own four ‘ears’. On the content layer (‘The traffic light is green’) the\ntwo people are still in agreement, but the driver interprets the appeal\n(‘Come on, drive!’) differently (i.e. ‘Why are you so slow?’) and finds this\ninsulting. He reacts accordingly: ‘Am I driving or you?’\nWe encounter this kind of flawed communication all the time: ‘Hey,\nwhat’s this in the soup?’ – ‘If you don’t like it, eat bread.’ ‘When will you\nbe ready?’ – ‘Stop hassling me!’\nThe way we understand messages is determined by the sender’s and\nreceiver’s previous history, the context, the tone and many other non-verbal\nsignals. How can we solve misunderstandings? By talking to each other\nabout how to talk to each other; in other words, by practising ‘meta-\ncommunication’. Because good communication occurs when intention and\nunderstanding are in harmony."

    "raw_text": "‘What is thought is not always said; what is said is not always heard; what\nis heard is not always understood; what is understood is not always agreed;\nwhat is agreed is not always done; what is done is not always done again.’\nKonrad Lorenz\n\f\n\n\f\nWhy it’s worth talking to each other\nThe twentieth century was the century of mass murder. Two world wars\ntook place within a period of thirty years. In-between, there was some lousy\ndiplomacy. The logic of this period was: ‘The clever side never gives in and\ncomes out on top.’ To win you have to take action, not negotiate. Europe\nwas in ruins by the time the game was over.\nDuring this period, John von Neumann, a mathematician, and Oskar\nMorgenstern, an economist, developed their famous Game Theory. This\ntheory examines conflicts in which the result for all participants depends on\ndecisions made by others – as in negotiations. Game Theory is based on the\nobservation that people in conflicts behave in the same way as they would\nwhen playing a board game: they want to win, but do so by sticking to the\nrules of the game, otherwise it won’t work. How do you win but still follow\nthe rules? The solution: by approaching and talking to each other. Or, in the\nwords of game theorists, by cooperating.\nLet’s take a simple example. At some point, most adults decide not to\ngive each other Christmas presents any more. The pressure to consume is\nannoying, and, in any case, what do you give a person who has everything?\nBut typically some people still do buy a present, even if they agreed not to.\nThe person who gets the gift but didn’t give one in return now has a bad\nconscience; the person who gave but didn’t receive is disappointed. The\nresult: conflict.\nThere are only two logical solutions and both have to do with\ncommunication: you have to decide whether (a) everyone or (b) nobody\ngets a gift. But this super-simple Game Theory solution can only be\nachieved if both sides go along with the plan and if they make a binding\nagreement to stick to it: two complex actions that people find hard to carry\nout.\n‘Meeting jaw to jaw is better than war.’\nWinston Churchill\n\f\n\n\f\nHow your therapist talks to you\nWhat does your therapist do when talking to you? He or she makes a so-\ncalled ‘second-order observation’.\nA first-order observer sees the world as it appears to him or her: the\nworld is simply there. The second-order observer, however, ascribes what\nthe first-order observer sees to how it is seen. Important: we cannot observe\nourselves observing (which is also why therapists can’t treat themselves).\nThis is often referred to as the ‘blind spot’. In other words, we are unaware\nof the way in which we observe; we cannot see that we cannot see. So by\nidentifying someone’s blind spot, the second-order observer might open up\na new perspective, and make that person aware, for example, of the fact that\nhe or she could just as easily see something differently.\nAn example: a couple want to move in together, but she has one of those\nflats that you simply wouldn’t want to give up: a great location, low rent, a\nbig balcony. And the flat would be big enough for two. He hesitates,\nbecause he feels that he would be intruding and that it would still feel like\nher flat. They cannot afford a new flat for the two of them. She sees only\nthe potential advantages of her flat, he sees only the potential\ndisadvantages. Both are first-order observers and are talking at cross-\npurposes.\nA second-order observer could give them another perspective: the couple\ncould move into the woman’s flat, but on the condition that it becomes a\nshared flat that they move into as if it were new. This means she has to first\n‘move out’ of her flat, before the two of them ‘move in’ and refurbish it.\nDespite the fact that most people constantly think about themselves, it is\nimpossible to observe yourself while doing (or thinking) something. We can\nonly train ourselves to be more aware of moments when we act or think\naccording to old (and bad) habits. But in order to recognize these patterns\nwe need a second observer.\nWe can’t see that we are seeing something.\n\f\n\n\f\nWhich ‘I’ do you use to communicate?\nHere are two of the greatest interpreters of human communication:\n· Sigmund Freud (1856–1939), the founder of psychoanalysis, believed\nthat hidden pleasures and fears from our childhood are the motivation\nbehind our communication problems.\n· The psychiatrist Eric Berne (1910–70), however, believed that you do not\nhave to go on a painful journey into your past to get to know yourself; it is\nenough to observe yourself in communication with others.\nIn 1964, Berne proposed in his book Games People Play a counter-model to\nFreud’s theory, a book which due to its simplicity and clarity became a\nbestseller in the genre of communication and self-help books. According to\nBerne, it all starts with the three ‘ego states’ we adopt in relation to others:\n1. The parent ego state: we all are a little like our parents. This is evident\nwhen we patronize others or tell them what they should or should not do.\nBut also when we act thoughtfully, empathically or helpfully.\n2. The adult ego state: we act like adults when we communicate in a\nconsidered, controlled and relaxed way. In other words, when we treat the\nother party respectfully and respond to criticism factually and\nconstructively.\n3. The child ego state: we also carry in us the child that we once were. We\nare unrepentant, defiant, silly or anxious. But positive qualities such as\nimagination, curiosity and learning are also evident in our childlike\ncommunication.\nAll states occur in one person. So what use is transactional analysis in\npractice? When we communicate, it is always from one of these ego states.\nWe are not always aware of this; but it is most evident when we observe\nourselves. Let’s suppose that a proposal we put forward in a discussion is\nrejected by the group. If we react in an offended way or respond defiantly,\nwe are in child mode. If we weigh things up rationally and realize that our"

So here are\nsome tips from parenting experts:\n· Be a role model: actions speak louder than words. A child won’t\nunderstand that he shouldn’t scream if you scream at him.\n· Correct content, not form: the child says: ‘I draw horsy.’ That’s fine, as\nlong as she is drawing a horse.\n· Be consistent: ‘no’ means ‘no’ – even when the child is having a tantrum\nat the supermarket check-out. Loophole: only make threats that you can\ngo back on without losing face. So don’t say: ‘If you don’t stop right away\nwe won’t go away on holiday.’\n· Implement threats immediately: children learn more quickly and\neffectively if you carry out your threats straight away. Instead of taking\naway a toy once for a whole week (long duration, small effect), it is better\nto take away the toy ten times for two minutes (small duration, big effect).\n· Praise an action, not the child: ‘What you’re doing is great’ is better\nthan ‘You’re great.’\n· Ignore bad behaviour: when a child does not behave according to your\nexpectations, but isn’t putting himself or others in danger, it is better to\nignore him than to rebuke him (‘selective attention’).\n· Offer alternatives: give your child different options, but never more than\ntwo, and only if an alternative makes sense (there is no alternative to teeth\nbrushing).\n· Tell a child what she should do, and not what she shouldn’t do: it’s\nbetter to say: ‘Please slow down’ than ‘Don’t run!’\n· Ask questions that can be answered: ‘How was school today?’ is as\ndifficult for your child to answer as it would be for you to answer: ‘How\nwas March to April 2014 for you?’"

Afterwards, when we slowly descend the stairs, we are suddenly\nmuch smarter than before.’ This is how William Lewis Hertslet described\nthe term in his bestseller Der Treppenwitz der Weltgeschichte (Staircase Wit\nof World History), which was published in 1882.\nOver 130 years later it is still as relevant as ever.

    "raw_text": "What kind of image we have of the world\nIn communication, there is a fundamental rule: how something is said and\nby whom – the ‘narrative context’, or frame – determines how something is\nunderstood. To take one example, if a sensational piece of news is printed in\na reputable newspaper, we are more inclined to believe it than if it is\nreported in a tabloid.\nThis observation was made by Erving Goffman, who described this form\nof interpretation as ‘framing’. If we look at a picture in a museum, we know\nthat it is art even if it looks like a stick figure drawn by a child. This is\nbecause we have learned to recognize the frame ‘modern art’. Another\nexample: if we go to a restaurant, we know how to behave – how to interact\nwith the waiter, how to handle a knife and fork, and what to do with the\nmenu. We know this because we know the frame ‘restaurant’. In his seminal\nwork The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life, Goffman uses the imagery\nof theatre and acting to describe human social interaction. He believes that\nwe each adapt our behaviour to each frame and are therefore a different\nperson in each situation. This means that there is no such thing as\nauthenticity. We are one person when we are at work, another when we talk\nto our parents and quite another when we are lost in a foreign city and have\nto communicate with strangers.\nDaniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky famously showed how different\nways of phrasing frame a dilemma and affect people’s responses to a\nchoice. This logic is used to great effect in advertising. For example, two\nyoghurts are on sale: one is ‘90% fat-free’ and the other is touted as having\na ‘10% fat content’. Although both contain equal quantities of fat, people\ntend to choose the yoghurt advertised as ‘almost fat-free’, because the\nframe for the yoghurt purports that it is a fat-free, healthier product. The\nbottom line is: we seldom make rational choices.\nThere are no objective or authentic messages. Everything that is being\ncommunicated is always framed. And if you want to decode a message, try\nto understand the frame."

    "raw_text": "Why the medium is the message\nThe Canadian media scholar Marshall McLuhan (1911–80), who generally\nshunned the limelight, became the world’s most talked-about intellectual in\n1967. This was because he had summed up the media revolution – the\ntransition from print to TV – in a single sentence: ‘The medium is the\nmessage.’ The sentence is not as simple as it first appears.\nWhat does it mean?\nIt does not mean what you might initially think, i.e. that the medium has\nbecome more important than its message. (A hint: McLuhan’s theories\nnever focus on the obvious, clear-cut or logical.) Rather, the sentence means\nthat the medium is not important because of its message, but because it can\nchange our behaviour, our thinking and our lives.\nAnd what does that mean?\nIf we use the word medium, we are usually only referring to the channel via\nwhich information is transmitted. McLuhan believed that this channel is\nmore formative for our culture than the message it carries. If the message\nchanges, we simply change our minds. But when the medium changes, we\nchange our behaviour. This sounded crazy in the 1960s. But since the\nadvent of social media, and since we have started to reflect on the ways in\nwhich mobile devices dominate our everyday lives, it makes much more\nsense. Suddenly, his meaning is crystal-clear: it’s not what we read on our\nsmartphone that changes our behaviour, but that we are reading it on our\nsmartphone. (What makes our smartphone so fascinating that we stroke it\nmore than our new-born child? – See ‘The Uses and Gratifications\nTheory’.)\n‘We shape our tools and the tools shape us,’ wrote McLuhan. He also\nwrote: ‘People don’t really read newspapers. They just climb into them\nevery morning like into a hot bath.’ Was there ever a better description for\nthe Internet? In his time, McLuhan was taken more seriously by hippies\nthan academics. This was a double misunderstanding, because, as a\nconservative Catholic, he was opposed to the media developments he\ndescribed.\n\f\nThe news doesn’t change us; the medium does: take a minute and make a\nlist of five things that have changed in your behaviour since using a\nsmartphone. Now ask yourself: what changes do you regret? And finally:\nwhat would it take to undo them?\n\f\n\n\f\nWhat happens if you don’t look at your smartphone\nThe Internet has multiplied the number of ways in which we communicate.\nWhile we still communicate one to one (in a personal email, for example),\nwe now also often communicate one to many (e.g. in a Facebook post or\nWhatsApp group message).\nOne of the most important elements of online communication is self-\npresentation: we only want to show our best side. We post photos of\nperfectly prepared dishes, perfect holidays, perfect parties, perfect scores.\nAnd this starts a vicious circle: whenever we feel bored or alone, we look at\nour smartphone. But what are we looking for? We basically want to see that\nothers have seen us – a ‘like’, a ‘share’, a ‘retweet’ is proof of that. But\nwhen looking at social media we also see the apparently perfect lives of our\nfriends – which we are not part of – and how these lives are being ‘liked’\nand ‘shared’. Scientists call the ‘uneasy and sometimes all-consuming\nfeeling that we’re missing out – that our peers are doing or in possession of\nmore or something better than we are’ – ‘Fear of Missing Out’, or FoMO. A\nteam of psychologists at the University of Essex, led by Andy Przybylski,\ncame up with this name.\nPeople under the age of thirty-five suffer more from this phenomenon,\nmen more than women, teenagers more than adults, unhappy more than\nhappy people. To clarify: it’s not a question of really missing out on\nsomething; it’s about the feeling of having missed out on something. We’ve\nall been there: when we’re feeling down, bored or stressed out, we check\nour smartphone. But all this does is make us feel even worse. Smartphones\nact like an accelerant when it comes to FoMO – and thereby corroborate the\nfifty-year-old ‘McLuhan’s Media Theory’: ‘The medium is the message.’\n‘In the twentieth century “I think, therefore I am” no longer applies, but\nrather “Others are thinking of me, therefore I am.” ’\nPeter Sloterdijk\n\f\n\n\f\nHow to recognize fake news\nThe term ‘fake news’ has become ubiquitous in recent years. But what is\nfake news? Basically it is an aggressive way to influence people. But, fake\nor not, all news is influencing – something which the inventor of public\nrelations, Edward L. Bernays, took full advantage of. (Fun fact: Bernays\nwas the nephew of Sigmund Freud, founder of psychoanalysis.) His most\nfamous work, which he wrote in 1927, was originally entitled Propaganda,\nbut he later changed the name to Public Relations. Bernays wrote: ‘The\nconscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions\nof the masses is an important element in democratic society … We are\ngoverned, our minds moulded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested,\nlargely by men we have never heard of.’ It’s a pretty good description of the\nworld we live in, isn’t it? But how should we interpret Bernays’s strangely\neuphoric-sounding text?\nLike this: freedom of expression is a democratic right. When everyone\nexpresses their opinion, millions of opinions and interests collide, and chaos\nensues. So either you create order out of the chaos by implementing\nrestrictions (which would be a dictatorship) or you have to make your own\nopinion as attractive as possible and market it as such. You can use all the\ntricks of the trade to come out on top. You can manipulate a little, cheat a\nlittle, exaggerate a little to make yourself more interesting. Ideas can be\npresented as attractive or less attractive, and it is up to individuals to decide\nwhether they want to follow them. This means: PR and advertising or even\nfake news cannot force us to do anything we don’t want.\nIf you want to analyse (fake) news, a good starting point is the light-\nhearted model developed by the American sociologist Harold D. Lasswell\nin 1948, which still works astonishingly well today: for example, to\nseparate fakes from facts. The formula is: ‘Who says what in which channel\nto whom with what effect’:\n· WHO?: by answering ‘who’ said it, we divert our attention to the sender.\nLasswell called this ‘control analysis’: who is talking? What is their aim?\nWho are their allies?\n· WHAT?: by looking at ‘what’ is being said, we give attention to the\nactual message (the ‘content analysis’) – to identify the aim behind the"

    "raw_text": "What we want when we’re online\nWhat makes screens so attractive was a question already being asked by\nresearchers in the early days of television. In 1960, the sociologist Elihu\nKatz claimed to have the answer. His ‘Uses and Gratifications Theory’ was\nradically different from other media effect theories. He believed that media\nconsumption was an active, voluntary decision, and consequently did not\nask what media does to us, but what we do with media. He identified five\nreasons why we use media and what we use it for (spoiler alert: the first\nthree reasons are obvious, the second two interesting):\n1. Information and education: we consume media to discover what has\nhappened but also to educate ourselves.\n2. Entertainment: we consume media for our emotional or aesthetic\npleasure.\n3. Identification: we consume media because we identify with people we\nsee on screen.\n4. Integration and social interaction: we consume media so that later we\ncan talk about what we saw or heard with others. Today the so-called\n‘second screen’ comes into play: we watch TV and at the same time\nconsume via a second screen like a smartphone, with the consequence\nthat we are alone and yet not lonely (for example, #doctorwho or\n#strictly) – see ‘The FoMO Phenomenon’.\n5. Escapism: we consume media to escape reality. Everyone is familiar\nwith this behaviour: we immerse ourselves in a film, a game or the\nInternet and forget about ourselves.\nIt is important to notice that according to this theory media do not force us\ninto anything – we decide for ourselves what we want to use.\n‘When I die I want my tombstone to say “Free WiFi” so people will visit\nmore often.’\nUnknown\n\f\n\n\f\nHow messages can be understood differently\nA small but significant question: is what I can hear the same as what you\nare saying?\nEvery child that has ever played Chinese Whispers knows the answer:\nnot always.\nOne of the greatest communication theorists, Stuart Hall (1932–2014),\nwas of the same opinion. In fact, he took the idea further. He believed not\nonly that we are capable of misunderstanding, but that we play an active\nrole in understanding, per se. We interpret, or ‘decode’, the same message\ndifferently, depending on our social class, our level of knowledge and our\ncultural background. But, above all, the way we understand a message also\ndepends on how we want to understand it. An example is the cult 1960s TV\nseries Star Trek. Many fans interpreted the series as a classic science fiction\nadventure in space. But the gay community saw the close-knit relationships\nbetween the men and the rainbow crew (black African, Asian, Russian,\nVulcan) as an allusion to the fact that some of the characters were gay. It is\nirrelevant that Star Trek’s creator, Gene Roddenberry, denied this, because,\naccording to Stuart Hall, the message can be changed once it has been\nreceived. In other words, Star Trek fans saw in the series what they wanted\nto see.\nThe Encoding/Decoding Model contradicts the classic sender–receiver\nmodel, according to which the recipient plays a passive role. Hall argued\nthat the way we receive a message is an active and never clear-cut process,\nso that the message can always be understood differently. The sender\nencodes the message with a particular intention. The receiver decodes the\nmessage in order to understand it. And this decoding can happen in three\ndifferent ways:\n1. Dominant-hegemonic: the desired reading – we understand the message\nthe way it was intended\n2. Oppositional: we oppose or dismiss the intended meaning\n3. Negotiated: a combination of the two\nA message is more than just what is said. It changes depending on how it is\nunderstood.\n\f\nLet’s put this into practice: if you are a leader, always make your team\nrepeat to you how they have understood your message. (That is, by the way,\nthe reason why co-pilots always repeat what they just heard the pilot say.)"

    "raw_text": "How we interpret signs\nWhen we want to communicate something, we use signs – words, gestures,\nfacial expressions, formulas, symbols or traffic signs – that the other person\nhas to translate into meaning. Semiotics is the study of signs; it is a cross-\nsection of sciences from the disciplines of psychology, philosophy,\nsociology, linguistics, computer science, design, art and mathematics. The\nbottom line is: we find signs everywhere we come across culture rather than\nnature.\nThe key points in brief:\n· Some signs – the swastika, a traffic light, the Nike swoosh – are easy to\nspot and more legible than words. We see them and understand what is\nmeant. A story, a rating, a command or a message springs to mind.\n· Perception in most people proceeds from image to text. We remember\ndrawings better than words, recognize patterns in representations more\nthan in sentences.\n· Some of the most important semioticians believe that all the following are\nsigns: a Rolls-Royce in front of the door, a blue sky, a hundred-dollar\nnote, open shoelaces, a half-empty or half-full glass of water, a magic\nformula, a traffic jam on the motorway, a sunset. Nothing can be\nperceived merely as what it is. It will always (have to) be interpreted by\nthe viewer as a sign of something.\n‘The visual is like the political: everyone thinks they understand\nsomething about it, and to an extent this is true.’ So says the German\nProfessor of Mass Communication, Marion G. Müller. She makes an\nimportant point about the design of signs and symbols: they are complex\nbut need to be comprehensible, otherwise there can be no communication.\nMost people understand complicated matter better through images than in\nwords. We remember pictures better than text and are more likely to\nrecognize patterns in images than in sentences."

    "raw_text": "How we obfuscate with language\nSpeaking in euphemisms is a form of linguistic whitewashing.\nGovernments prefer to speak of ‘enhanced interrogation methods’ rather\nthan torture. The company spokesman will not say that staff are being\ndismissed, but that the company is ‘restructuring’. Products are ‘a bargain’,\nnot cheap. If we tell a lie we are simply ‘stretching the truth’. And when we\nare broke, we can give it the fancy expression ‘negative cash flow’. The\nopposite of a euphemism – when you give something a negative meaning –\nis called a dysphemism: someone with strong political views will\nimmediately become an ‘extremist’.\nEuphemisms are the stealth bombers of rhetoric. At first glance they are\nnot visible, but their attacks are insidious: by the time you become aware of\nthem, the damage is already done. The Nazis loved euphemisms: ‘land\nconsolidation’ instead of expulsion, ‘labour camp’ instead of concentration\ncamp, ‘special action’ instead of killing.\nEuphemisms crop up in almost all political and corporate\ncommunications; for example, a town hall meeting might suggest a friendly\nlocal gathering where everyone can contribute, but in fact the CEO just\nwants to get a particular message across. Downsizing suggests a sort of\ninevitability to making a company somewhat cosier in size without\nmentioning job cuts.\nEuphemisms are the mother tongue of manipulation. As a rule of thumb, if\nsomeone doesn’t use straight language, don’t act straight away – pause\nbefore acting.\n\f\n\n\f\nHow you can explain practically anything with spurious\ncorrelations\nIn Ancient Greece, debate was central to the forming of opinions. A\ndistinction between good and bad reasoning was made:\n· Good reasoning aims to convince, but it also lets itself be convinced.\nSimply put, it is the search for truth.\n· Bad reasoning has no interest in the truth; it is simply about wanting to be\nright.\nPlato called bad reasoning ‘sophistic’. The Sophists claimed to be able to\njustify any position through reasoning and logic. They aimed at defeating\ntheir opponents in debates using rhetorical strategies (see ‘Theory of\nRhetoric’) and logical arguments. The Sophists were unpopular, despised\nand – successful.\nA well-known example is that of Euathlus, who was educated in\nsophistry by Protagoras. They made an agreement that Euathlus would only\nhave to pay for his instruction after he won his first lawsuit. But after his\neducation Euathlus took up a different profession. Therefore he did not\nconduct any lawsuits, could not win any, and argued that he did not have to\npay for his instruction. Subsequently, Protagoras sued him and argued\nsophistically: ‘Euathlus will pay: if he wins the case, he will have to pay\naccording to the original agreement, and if he loses, the court will order him\nto pay.’ Euathlus, Protagoras’ best-trained Sophist, replied: ‘I will not have\nto pay on any account: because if I lose the case I do not have to pay\naccording to the original agreement, and if I win, I will owe you nothing\naccording to the verdict.’ It is an ingenious, logical argument, but also a\ndeliberately induced fallacy – a sophism.\nNow, you should not think that sophism died out with the Ancient\nGreeks. On the contrary: it still exists and is in excellent health! Modern\ninstances of sophism are spurious relationships: ‘In spring, storks return\nfrom the south. In spring the number of births demonstrably increases. The\ntwo things must be linked!’ No. The two statements correlate, but are not\ncausal. What’s more, they have nothing to do with each other.\n\f\n‘Most of you will have heard the maxim “Correlation does not imply\ncausation.” Just because two variables have a statistical relationship with\neach other does not mean that one is responsible for the other. For instance,\nice cream sales and forest fires are correlated because both occur more\noften in the summer heat. But there is no causation; you don’t set a patch of\nthe Montana brush on fire when you buy a pint of Häagen-Dazs.’\nNate Silver\n\f\n\n\f\nHow the media corroborates our opinions\nOne of the most frequently cited communication theories is George\nGerbner’s Cultivation Theory from 1976, which claims that people who\nwatch a lot of television are more likely to ‘cultivate’ the belief that reality\ncorresponds with what they are seeing on TV . He argued that watching a lot\nof television changes our perception of reality and causes anxiety.\nThe mass media – in the past film and TV , nowadays mostly games and\nthe Internet – confronts us with an exaggerated, stylized world. According\nto Gerbner, those who consume a lot of media start to see the real world in\nthe way it is stylized on screen. Some examples: in everyday life we rarely\nsee a policeman with a drawn gun; in a crime drama, however, it is\nstandard. In reality we rarely see violence; on screen we see it all the time.\nAccording to Gerbner, if we consume these kinds of on-screen images over\na long period of time, our perception of reality changes and we begin to\ninternalize it. Even if we don’t actually see any violence, we start to believe\nthe world is a violent place. And the more violent and frightening images\nwe see, the more anxious we become in our everyday lives.\nSo the media influences us. But to what extent? Does it mean, for\nexample, that excessively playing FPS (First Person Shooter) games will\ncause the player to go on a killing spree? No, the media does not form our\nopinions and beliefs, but it does reinforce them. So somebody who already\nhas violent fantasies will find affirmation for them online. But somebody\nwho coexists peacefully with others will not turn into a serial killer by\nwatching violent films several nights in a row.\nIt is important to remember that we prefer to watch things we enjoy – as\nis demonstrated most clearly by the filter-bubble effect: on the Internet,\nalgorithms try to predict what information we will be looking for based on\nour interests and opinions. That way there is little chance of being\nconvinced by a different opinion, because we are unlikely to be ‘served’\nany alternative views. When it comes to decision making this kind of self-\nconfirming information proves a huge risk, as explained in the chapter on\n‘Groupthink’.\nThe Cultivation Theory has been criticized for its lack of complexity.\nViewers are regarded as passive and easy to manipulate.

    "raw_text": "interested in the opposite view, take a look at ‘The Encoding/Decoding\nModel’.\nIf you like apples and spend hours watching a TV programme about pears,\nyou won’t suddenly prefer pears afterwards. But if you already like pears\nand spend hours watching a programme about pears, you will like pears\neven more afterwards.\n\f\n\n\f\nWhat opinion has to do with power\nEveryone has a voice, but not everyone is heard. The voices that prevail are\ncalled ‘hegemonic’. The creation of hegemony has little to do with\ndemocracy and everything to do with power. It is not a question of who has\nsomething legitimate or important to say, but always of who has sufficient\nresources and influence in a society to define their opinion as legitimate or\nimportant. The hegemonic perspective is considered neutral. Anything that\ndeviates from it is seen as an exception and ascribed to others. The\nhegemonic view claims not to represent a specific point of view, position or\nlife experience, but rather to represent things as simply ‘the way they are’.\nAn example: the media in the Western world is dominated by white male\njournalists. Nevertheless, the news never announces: ‘Today you will hear\nthe news from a white male perspective.’ ‘White’ and ‘male’ are not\nexplicitly named; they are regarded as general, neutral and non-specific.\nAnother example: if a married couple are heterosexual, their sexual\norientation isn’t mentioned; if they are homosexual it is.\nThe question of hegemonic voices is associated with the concept of\nwhich truths prevail. Here we come to the Standpoint Theory, whose most\nimportant proponents are Donna Haraway and Sandra Harding. They\nmaintain that a voice – or standpoint – cannot be objective or neutral, or\nexist outside a specific social context. Here is an example: in science – and\nin children’s books to the present day – the idea that prehistoric people\nhunted mammoths was long considered to be fact. Prehistoric people, or,\nmore concretely, prehistoric men, set off on dangerous mammoth-hunting\nexpeditions. But in fact this image was created in the nineteenth century at a\ntime when hunting was no longer essential for survival, but was simply a\nstatus symbol. In their interpretations of prehistory, archaeologists\nneglected unspectacular types of food procurement such as gathering\nberries and roots, or trapping small animals.\nThis is not to say that men did not sometimes slay a mammoth. But it\ndistorts the fact that they mainly collected berries. Here, the historians were\nnot objective, but confirmed the stereotype of men as brave fighters,\nwarriors and family breadwinners, as if this were a law of nature. Bottom\nline: if you believe that you hold an objective opinion, ask yourself what\nother points of view were excluded so that yours could prevail.\n\f\nIf you want to make sure that every voice in the room is heard, you can ask\nyour team not to express their opinion about a given topic, but rather\nbrainstorm different possible opinions. That way sooner or later even the\nunheard voices will appear on the flipchart and once they are up there, they\ncan be discussed.\n\f\nC O N C L U S I O N"

    "raw_text": "What we remember from a conversation\nHere’s a question: how do we know if a presentation, a job interview or a\ndate went well?\nWe usually have a good hunch – but do we really know? Assessing a date\nwould involve some pretty complicated number crunching: we’d have to\ncalculate how we felt, how the other person felt, what we had expected and\nso on. An impossible task.\nIt turns out our mind solves this problem by using a surprisingly simple\nstrategy, as Laurie Santos from Yale University explains brilliantly in a\nlecture: when we remember something we ignore most of it. Actually we\nmake an assessment based only on two parts of the experience:\n1. The peak – i.e. the part of the experience that was most extreme (either\npleasant or unpleasant).\n2. The end – i.e. whether it got better or worse at the end. (This is\nimportant: even a small improvement can make the date seem like an OK\nexperience, whereas a poor ending will ruin an otherwise great evening).\nThis is the Peak–End Rule, devised in a 1993 study by the Nobel laureate\nDaniel Kahneman and his colleagues.\nHow can we use this in our life?\nThe Peak–End Rule gives us some hints about how to make an experience\nspecial:\nWe often obsess about what kind of first impression we make on people,\nfearing that people might judge us based only on our outward appearance or\nfirst sentences. This thinking is based on the famous notion of ‘You only\nhave one chance to make a first impression.’ Though this holds true – the\nfirst thing we hear about someone influences our judgement of that person,\nthe first price we are quoted forms the basis for the negotiation; it is the\nanchor effect – maybe we should start obsessing about something else:\nthere might be only one chance to make a lasting impression. That lasting\nimpression is not necessarily the first impression, but rather the last one.\n\f\n(That is, by the way, the reason why we binge-watch TV shows: by ending\non a cliffhanger they have perfected the Peak–End Rule.)\nSo when it comes to communication, it is of course important how we\nstart a meeting, how we set the tone, how we break the ice. But, according\nto Kahneman’s work, maybe we should start focusing on how we want to\nend the whole damned thing.\n‘I don’t care about opening sentences.
