The passage is about a young man named Charles who struggles with his disinterest in formal schooling. He earns his Bachelor of Arts degree from Cambridge in May 1831 and hopes to leave schooling behind, but then receives a recommendation for an unpaid position as a naturalist on the HMS Beagle. The voyage is set to embark on a journey around the globe surveying various coastlines.

Charles initially turns down the offer due to his father's objections, who argues that it would jeopardize Charles' position in the church. However, after some thought, he decides to accept and eventually gets his father's consent. He boards the ship with Captain Robert FitzRoy and embarks on a journey filled with adventure and discovery.

During the voyage, Charles faces many challenges including seasickness, loneliness, and dealing with Captain FitzRoy's mood swings and religious fanaticism. Despite these struggles, he eventually adapts to life on board by observing the ship's crew members as if they were butterflies.

Charles arrives in Brazil where he experiences intense variety in vegetation and wildlife. He realizes that South America has interior parts yet unexplored by naturalists, which ignites his passion for discovery. Charles embarks on various expeditions throughout the continent collecting an array of unique animal and insect specimens.

A year into the journey, Charles discovers fossilized remains on a beach 400 miles south of Buenos Aires that would ultimately set his mind to thinking about evolutionary theories. This discovery would lead him down a path of questioning and exploration throughout his life as he sought to unravel the mysteries of life's origins and development.
