It was a warm summer evening in Los Angeles when I met him. The first thing that struck me about this man was the intensity with which he focused on his task. It didn't matter what it was - whether he was working out, studying tapes of opponents, or giving advice to fighters at the gym where he had trained. His passion for boxing was evident in every action, from his powerful right hand punches during mitt practice to his fluid footwork.

This man was none other than Freddie Roach, a former professional boxer turned world-renowned trainer. He retired from competitive boxing due to health issues but found solace and purpose in helping others achieve their dreams within the ring. Living in Las Vegas and moving from one bad job to another during his off-hours, he began frequenting the gym where he had once trained as an amateur fighter.

Without getting paid, Roach became a de facto assistant to legendary trainer Freddie Futch, even directly training some of the fighters himself. He knew Futch's system well and had internalized many of the techniques he taught. Roach added his own twist to the training sessions by taking the mitt work - the large padded gloves that trainers use in the ring to practice various punches and combinations with their fighters - to a higher level, creating longer and more fluid practice sessions.

It also gave him a chance to be more involved in the action, something he missed when working alongside Futch. After several years of honing his craft under Futch's tutelage, Roach realized that he was good at this and decided to leave Futch to begin his own career as a trainer.

To Roach, the sport was changing rapidly. Fighters had become faster than ever before, but trainers like Futch still promoted a rather static style of boxing that did not exploit these changes. Slowly, Roach began experimenting with the whole training dynamic. He expanded the mitt work into something larger, simulating an entire fight that could go on for several rounds.

This allowed him to get closer to his fighters, literally feeling their full arsenal of punches over time and seeing how they moved in the ring. He began studying tapes of opponents, looking for any pattern or weakness in their style. He would devise a strategy around this weakness and go over it with his boxers in the mitt work.

Interacting so closely with his fighters, Roach developed a different kind of rapport than what he had with Futch - more visceral and connected. But no matter the boxer, there seemed to be an inevitability of hitting a plateau where everything became stale and opponents would catch on to their weaknesses.

Working together in this way, Roach was able to transform a one-dimensional, relatively unknown fighter into perhaps the greatest boxer of his generation. In theory, there should be no limit to what we can learn from mentors who have wide experience. However, in practice, this is rarely the case. The reasons are several: at some point, the relationship can become flat; it's difficult for us to maintain the same level of attention that we had in the beginning; we might come to resent their authority as we gain skill and the difference between us becomes less pronounced.

Some mentors come from a different generation with a different worldview. At a certain point, some of their cherished principles might seem out of touch or irrelevant, and we unconsciously tune them out. The only solution is to evolve a more interactive dynamic with the mentor. If they can adapt to some of your ideas, the relationship becomes more animated. Feeling a growing openness on their part towards your input, you are less resentful. You reveal your own experiences and ideas, perhaps loosening them up so their principles don't harden into dogma.

This type of interaction is more in tune with our democratic times and can serve as an ideal for mentorship relationships today. However, it should not go along with a rebellious attitude or a lessening of respect. The dynamic sketched out earlier in this chapter remains the same. Like Pacquiao, you bring to the relationship the utmost admiration and your total attention. You are completely open to their instruction. Gaining their respect for how teachable you are, they will fall under your spell as Roach did with Pacquiao. With your intense focus, you improve in your skill levels, giving you the power to introduce more of yourself and your needs into the relationship.

You give them feedback on their instruction, perhaps adjusting some of their ideas. This must begin with you, as you set the tone with your hunger to learn. Once a back-and-forth dynamic is sparked, the relationship has almost limitless potential for learning and absorbing power.

There are times when we have no choice but to make a virtue out of necessity. That was the path taken by perhaps the greatest historical figure ever to attain mastery alone - Thomas Alva Edison (1847-1931). From a very early age, Edison became accustomed to doing things for himself due to his family's poverty. By the time he was twelve, he had already started earning money by selling newspapers on trains while traveling around his native Michigan for work. This experience developed an ardent curiosity within him that would ultimately lead him down the path of innovation and invention.

In essence, Edison's success stemmed from his ability to constantly learn and adapt without relying on others. It is a lesson that we can all take to heart in our own lives - regardless of whether we are facing adversity or simply seeking personal growth.
