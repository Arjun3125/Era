In his quest to decipher ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics, a young man named Jean-Francois Champollion (1790–1832) made remarkable progress. Raised in a small town near Grenoble, Champollion was drawn to the history of ancient civilizations from an early age and became fascinated with Egypt after hearing about the Rosetta Stone in 1802.

Champollion began to study hieroglyphics by learning Coptic, a language used by Egyptian Christians that had evolved from demotic and incorporated Greek elements. He mastered the language quickly and developed an intense relationship with hieroglyphs, bordering on obsession.

Despite his enthusiasm, Champollion struggled with political turmoil throughout his lifetime. A supporter of Napoleon, he lost his job as a professor when King Louis XVIII came to power after Napoleon's defeat. However, in 1821, he was rehabilitated by the government and could continue his research on hieroglyphics.

Champollion approached decipherment from a different perspective than others. He realized that languages evolve haphazardly, influenced by new groups entering society and shaped over time. Instead of approaching hieroglyphics as a mathematical code, he saw them as living organisms, complex and multifaceted.

Champollion's breakthrough came in September 1822 when accurate drawings of hieroglyphs from an ancient temple fell into his hands. Upon examining these depictions, he identified new letters for his knowledge, which ultimately helped him to unlock the secrets of the Rosetta Stone and decipher Egyptian hieroglyphics.
