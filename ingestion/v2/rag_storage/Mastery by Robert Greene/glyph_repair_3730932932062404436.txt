The text seems to be a passage about the process of learning and mastering complex skills, with an emphasis on practice and the fusion of mind and body. The author uses examples from flying a jet in combat to demonstrate this idea. They also discuss the importance of internalizing information and building skills gradually through conscious and deliberate effort.

The passage emphasizes that achieving great feats requires hard work and practice, rather than relying on innate talent or genius. It argues that by practicing consistently and deliberately, anyone can achieve a high level of mastery in any skill. The author also suggests that our cultural values often undervalue the importance of practice and may prevent us from recognizing the potential for growth and improvement in ourselves and others.
