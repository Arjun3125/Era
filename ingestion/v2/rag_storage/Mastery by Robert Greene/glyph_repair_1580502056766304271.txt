ABSORB THE MASTER'S POWER: THE MENTOR DYNAMIC
LIFE IS SHORT, AND YOUR TIME FOR LEARNING AND CREATIVITY IS LIMITED. WITHOUT ANY GUIDANCE, YOU CAN WASTE VALUABLE YEARS TRYING TO GAIN KNOWLEDGE AND PRACTICE FROM VARIOUS SOURCES. INSTEAD, YOU MUST FOLLOW THE EXAMPLE SET BY MASTERS THROUGHOUT THE AGES AND FIND THE PROPER MENTOR. CHOOSE THE MENTOR WHO BEST FITS YOUR NEEDS AND CONNECTS TO YOUR LIFE'S TASK. ONCE YOU HAVE INTERNALIZED THEIR KNOWLEDGE, YOU MUST MOVE ON AND NEVER REMAIN IN THEIR SHADOW. YOUR GOAL IS ALWAYS TO SURPASS YOUR MENTORS IN MASTERY AND BRILLIANCE.

THE ALCHEMY OF KNOWLEDGE

The importance of humility - the value of mentors - the mentor-protégé dynamic - learning as alchemy - interpretation of Michael Faraday story - Alexander the Great - the value of personal interaction - finding and attracting a mentor - famous figures or books as mentors - the mentor as father figure - when to cut the Master

STRATEGIES FOR DEEPENING THE MENTOR RELATIONSHIP

SOCIAL INTELLIGENCE
Often the greatest obstacle to our pursuit of mastery comes from the emotional drain we experience in dealing with the resistance and manipulations of the people around us. We misread their intentions and react in ways that cause confusion or conflict. Social intelligence is the ability to see people in the most realistic light possible. Navigating smoothly through the social environment, we have more time and energy to focus on learning and acquiring skills. Success attained without this intelligence is not true mastery, and will not last.
