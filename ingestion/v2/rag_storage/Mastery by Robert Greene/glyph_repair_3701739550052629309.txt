Fuller was walking along Lake Michigan and contemplating his life when he heard a voice. The voice told him not to seek validation for his thoughts and that he belonged to the universe, not himself. This message changed his outlook on life and led him to create unique inventions such as the Dymaxion car, Dymaxion house, and geodesic dome.

Temple Grandin faced a similar situation in her early years. Diagnosed with autism at age three, she struggled with learning disabilities and socializing with other children. However, she found comfort in interacting with animals and using her hands to create things.

Both Fuller and Grandin went on to make significant contributions to their respective fields despite their challenges. Their experiences serve as an inspiration to others who may feel limited by their circumstances or abilities.
