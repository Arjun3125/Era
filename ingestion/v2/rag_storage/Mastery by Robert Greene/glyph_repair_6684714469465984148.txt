The text was about Temple Grandin, an American scientist and author who has written many books on her experiences as someone with autism. She studied animal behavior and designed humane livestock handling systems, which have been adopted by the meat industry in the United States and other countries. The text explains how she used her unique perspective to study both animals and autism.

The other text was about Cesar Rodriguez, a former US Air Force pilot who struggled with flying due to his lack of innate talent for it. He had to practice extensively in order to improve his skills. However, as he put in the hours of practice, he realized that he could develop powers of concentration and the ability to fly in formation. Through sheer determination and hard work, he was able to rise through the ranks until he reached the level of fighter pilot.

The main theme in both stories is how perseverance, practice, and dedication can help individuals overcome their perceived weaknesses or limitations and achieve mastery in any field they choose.
