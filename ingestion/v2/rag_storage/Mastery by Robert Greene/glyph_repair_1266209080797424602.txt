The rocks, than if I had stayed upon the green shore and…
took tea and comfortable advice.”
In the aftermath of writing what he considered to be a mediocre poem, Keats took stock of all of the invaluable lessons he had learned. Never again would he suffer from writer's block—he had trained himself to write past any obstacle. He had acquired now the habit of writing quickly, with intensity and focus—concentrating his work in a few hours. He could revise with equal speed.
He had learned how to criticize himself and his overly romantic tendencies. He could look at his own work with a cold eye. He had learned that it was in the actual writing of the poem that the best ideas would often come to him, and that he had to boldly keep writing or he would miss such discoveries. Most important of all, as a counterexample to Endymion, he had hit upon a style that suited him—language as compact and dense with imagery as possible, with not a single wasted line.
With these lessons in hand, in the years 1818 to 1819, before he became gravely ill, Keats would produce some of the most memorable poems in the English language, including all of his greatest odes. This added up to perhaps the most productive two years of writing in the history of Western literature—all of it set up by the rigorous self-apprenticeship he had put himself through.
By nature, we humans shrink from anything that seems possibly painful or overtly difficult. We bring this natural tendency to our practice of any skill. Once we grow adept at some aspect of this skill, generally one that comes more easily to us, we prefer to practice this element over and over again. Our skill becomes lopsided as we avoid our weaknesses. Knowing that in our practice we can let down our guard, since we are not being watched or under pressure to perform, we bring to this a kind of dispersed attention. We tend also to be quite conventional in our practice routines. We generally follow what others have done, performing the accepted exercises for these skills.
This is the path of amateurs. To attain mastery, you must adopt what we shall call Resistance Practice. The principle is simple—you go in the opposite direction of all of your natural tendencies when it comes to practice.
First, you resist the temptation to be nice to yourself. You become your own worst critic; you see your work as if through the eyes of others. You recognize your weaknesses, precisely the elements you are not good at. Those are the aspects you give precedence to in your practice. You find a kind of perverse pleasure in working on them.
Second, you must learn to resist the urge for instant gratification. Instead, focus on slow and steady progress over time. The path to mastery is rarely a straight line—it's more like climbing up a mountain, where each step forward represents significant growth and learning. Resist the temptation to quit when things get tough or when you hit an obstacle that seems insurmountable.
Third, you must learn to resist the urge to compare yourself to others. This is one of the most common pitfalls of any skill development journey. Comparing ourselves to others can lead us down a rabbit hole of self-doubt and insecurity, which ultimately holds us back from achieving our full potential.
Instead, focus on your own progress and your unique strengths. Embrace the fact that everyone's path is different, and that there is no "right" or "wrong" way to approach any skill. The only person you should be comparing yourself to is yourself—the person you were yesterday or a week ago.
Finally, you must learn to resist the urge for perfection. Perfectionism can be a double-edged sword in skill development. On one hand, it can drive us towards excellence and push us to reach our full potential. But on the other hand, it can also paralyze us with fear of failure and hold us back from taking risks or trying new things.
Remember that no one is perfect—not even the world's greatest masters at their craft. We all have strengths and weaknesses, and it's through embracing our imperfections and learning to work with them that we ultimately achieve mastery in any skill.
