Weak and vulnerable creatures, early humans developed an intense focus and a mental capacity that has set them apart from all other animals on the planet. By standing upright and leveraging their powerful visual system, they could see far into the distance while also paying close attention to what was nearest at hand. This allowed them to detect danger and navigate their environment with unparalleled efficiency and accuracy.
