It is imagined that certain people in history - the naturally gifted, the geniuses - have either somehow bypassed or greatly shortened the Apprenticeship Phase due to their inherent brilliance. To support such an argument, people will bring up classic examples like Mozart and Einstein, who seemed to have emerged as creative geniuses out of nowhere. However, with the case of Mozart, it is generally agreed among classical music critics that he did not write an original substantial piece of music until well after ten years of composing. In fact, a study of some seventy great classical composers determined that with only three exceptions, all of the composers had needed at least ten years to produce their first great work, and the exceptions had somehow managed to create theirs in nine years. Einstein began his serious thought experiments at the age of sixteen. Ten years later he came up with his first revolutionary theory of relativity. It is impossible to quantify the time he spent honing his theoretical skills in those ten years, but it is not hard to imagine him working three hours a day on this particular problem, which would yield more than 10,000 hours after a decade. What separates Mozart and Einstein from others is the extreme youth with which they began their apprenticeships and the intensity with which they practiced, stemming from their total immersion in the subject. It is often the case that in our younger years we learn faster, absorb more deeply, and yet retain a kind of creative verve that tends to fade as we get older. There are no shortcuts or ways to bypass the Apprenticeship Phase. It is the nature of the human brain to require such lengthy exposure to a field, which allows for complex skills to become deeply embedded and frees the mind up for real creative activity. The very desire to find shortcuts makes you eminently unsuited to any kind of mastery. There is no possible reversal to this process.
