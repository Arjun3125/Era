As he examined the flora and fauna of South America, he speculated that these mountains had once stood in the Atlantic Ocean. A series of volcanoes, thousands of years ago, must have raised them higher and higher. Instead of relics to support stories in the Bible, he was finding evidence for something shockingly different.

As the journey progressed, Darwin noted some obvious changes in himself. He used to find almost any kind of work boring, but now he could labor all hours of the day; in fact, with so much to explore and learn, he hated wasting a single minute of the voyage. He had cultivated an incredible eye for the flora and fauna of South America. He could identify local birds by their songs, the markings on their eggs, their manner of taking flight. All of this information he could catalog and organize in an efficient manner. More important, his whole way of thinking had changed.

He would observe something, read and write about it, then develop a theory after even more observation, the theories and observations feeding off one another. Full of details about so many facets of the world he was exploring, ideas were sprouting up out of nowhere.

In September 1835, the Beagle left the Pacific Coast of South America and headed west for the journey home. Their first stop along the way was a series of virtually unoccupied islands known as the Galápagos. The islands were famous for their wildlife, but nothing could prepare Darwin for what he would find there. Captain FitzRoy gave him one week to explore one of the islands, and then they would be on their way. From the moment he stepped on the island, Darwin realized something was different: this small speck of land was crammed with life that was not like anywhere else—thousands of black marine iguanas swarming around him, on the beach and in the shallow water; 500-pound tortoises lumbering about the shore; seals, penguins, and flightless cormorants, all cold-water creatures inhabiting a tropical island.

By the end of the week, he had counted twenty-six unique species of land birds on this one island alone. His jars began to fill up with the most bizarre plants, snakes, lizards, fish, and insects. Back on board the Beagle, he began to catalog and categorize the remarkable number of specimens he had collected. He was struck by the fact that almost all of them represented completely new species. He then made an even more remarkable discovery: the species differed from island to island, even though they were only some fifty miles apart. The tortoise shells had different markings, and the birds' songs were distinctly different.

As he continued to explore and study these islands, Darwin began to develop a theory that would change the way we understand the natural world. He proposed that all species are related by common descent, and that they have evolved over time through the process of natural selection. This idea, which came to be known as evolution by natural selection, would revolutionize our understanding of the biological world.

Darwin's apprenticeship in the study of nature was not easy, but it was essential for his future success. He spent years observing and experimenting with various species, slowly developing the skills and knowledge that he needed to formulate his groundbreaking theories. He made countless mistakes along the way, but he also learned from them and grew as a scientist.

His journey through the Galápagos Islands was just one part of this apprenticeship, but it was an essential one. It was here that he first saw the evidence that would lead him to develop his theory of evolution by natural selection. It was here that he began to understand the complexity and diversity of life on Earth.

Darwin's story is a powerful reminder of the importance of apprenticeship in our lives. It shows us that we all have a unique path to follow, and that we must be willing to make mistakes and learn from them if we want to achieve greatness. It teaches us that success is not about following someone else's lead or relying on advice from a book; it is about finding our own way and discovering our true potential.
