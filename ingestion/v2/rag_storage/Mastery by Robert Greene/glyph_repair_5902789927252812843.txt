TEXT:
can	to	get	by.”
As	you	must	know	by	now,	these	voices	do	not	speak	the	truth.	Mastery	is
not	a	question	of	genetics	or	luck,	but	of	following	your	natural	inclinations	and
the	deep	desire	that	stirs	you	from	within.	Everyone	has	such	inclinations.	This
desire	within	you	is	not	motivated	by	egotism	or	sheer	ambition	for	power,	both
of	which	 are	 emotions	 that	 get	 in	 the	 way	 of	 mastery.	 It	 is	 instead	 a	 deep
expression	of	something	natural,	something	that	marked	you	at	birth	as	unique.
In	following	your	inclinations	and	moving	toward	mastery,	you	make	a	great
contribution	to	society,	enriching	it	with	discoveries	and	insights,	and	making	the
most	of	the	diversity	in	nature	and	among	human	society.	It	is	in	fact	the	height
of	selfishness	to	merely	consume	what	others	create	and	to	retreat	into	a	shell	of
limited	 goals	 and	 immediate	 pleasures.	 Alienating	 yourself	 from	 your
inclinations	can	only	lead	to	pain	and	disappointment	in	the	long	run,	and	a
sense	that	you	have	wasted	something	unique.	This	pain	will	be	expressed	in
bitterness	 and	 envy,	 and	 you	 will	 not	 recognize	 the	 true	 source	 of	 your
depression.
Your	
true	self
	does	not	speak	in	words	or	banal	phrases.	Its	voice	comes
from	
deep
	 within	 you,	 from	
the	 substrata	 of	 your	 psyche,	 from	 something
embedded	 physically	 within	 you.	 It	 emanates	 from	 your	 uniqueness,	 and	 it
communicates	through	sensations	and	powerful	desires	that	seem	to	transcend
you.	You	cannot	ultimately	understand	why	you	are	drawn	to	certain	activities	or
forms	of	knowledge.	This	cannot	be	described	in	words,	but	it	is	the	source	of
your	passion	and	motivation.
In	your	search	for	mastery,	you	must	embrace	this	inner	guide	and	follow	its	direction.
It	will	lead	you	to	greater	freedom	and	fulfillment	than	you	could	ever	imagine.
