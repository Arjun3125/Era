The text is about a man named Graham who had an idea for controlling a program by clicking on links. He and his friend Morris decided to give it a try, and within a few days they finished the first version of the software which functioned beautifully. They realized that their concept of a web application would work. Over the next few weeks, they refined the software and found their own angel investor who put up an initial $10,000 for a 10% share in the business.

The text then goes on to discuss how their company, Viaweb, took off due to the uniqueness of their idea, which was largely based on their distaste for Windows. They were able to generate a continuous stream of new releases of the software and interact directly with consumers, getting instant feedback and improving the program in days rather than months.

The text then provides some historical examples of inventors who had similar experiences, such as the invention of microprocessors, transistor radios, and eventually computers themselves. It discusses how these inventors were able to look at everyday things in a different light and imagine new uses for them. This ultimately led to their success.

The text ends by discussing how Graham's success with Viaweb led him to write essays for the Internet and give talks about technology startups. He then decided to try his hand at investing in other people's ideas. He came up with the idea of investing $15,000 in ten startups all at once. This would serve as a crash course for him in investing and business, and he recruited Robert Morris to join him in the venture.

The text concludes by discussing how Graham and Morris realized they were onto something powerful with their new approach to investing and decided to call it their "new co". If it really took off, not only would they make a fortune, but they would also have a significant impact on the economy by unleashing thousands of savvy entrepreneurs.
