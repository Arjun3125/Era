of time, developed a unique ability to understand the world around them through intensive observation and practice. They mastered skills such as hunting, toolmaking, and social interactions that allowed them to thrive in their environment. As they honed their abilities, they were able to tap into what can be described as a preverbal form of third-level intelligence.

This intelligence enabled them to think inside everything around them, anticipating behavioral patterns and enhancing their ability to track and kill prey. They could even feel the tools they used as extensions of their own hands, allowing for greater control over their instruments. This mastery was possible only after years of experience and practice, during which time they learned to focus on something higher than the specific actions involved.

Their relationship with time fundamentally changed how the human mind developed. Instead of viewing time as an enemy, they embraced it as a means to learn and adapt. By going through processes over months or years, they were able to move to higher levels of intelligence, think deeply, practice skills with finesse, and develop their own thoughts and ideas.

However, this focus on mastery can be easily lost when people believe that they can skip steps, avoid the process, or gain power quickly through shortcuts or reliance on natural talents. In doing so, they go against the grain of their natural development and risk becoming slaves to time. Instead of tapping into the potential of their minds and connecting with reality, they become trapped in a narrow chamber of thought.

The key to unlocking our full potential is to recognize that we have inherited an instrument - our brain - that is remarkably plastic. By embracing the process of learning, practice, and focus, we can connect with reality, develop our skills, and reach higher levels of intelligence.
