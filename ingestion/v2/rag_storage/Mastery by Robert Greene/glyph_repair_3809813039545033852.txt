The best mentors are often those who have wide knowledge and experience, and are not overly specialized in their field—they can train you to think on a higher level, and to make connections between different forms of knowledge. The paradigm for this is the Aristotle-Alexander the Great relationship. Philip II, Alexander's father and king of Macedonia, chose Aristotle to mentor his thirteen-year-old son because the philosopher had learned and mastered so many different fields. He could thus impart to Alexander an overall love of learning, and teach him how to think and reason in any kind of situation—the greatest skill of all. This ended up working to perfection. Alexander was able to effectively apply the reasoning skills he had gained from Aristotle to politics and warfare. To the end of his life he maintained an intense curiosity for any field of knowledge, always gathering about him experts he could learn from. Aristotle had imparted a form of wisdom that played a key role in Alexander's success. You will want as much personal interaction with the mentor as possible. A virtual relationship is never enough. There are cues and subtle aspects you can only pick up through a person-to-person interaction—such as a way of doing things that has evolved through much experience. These patterns of action are hard to put into words, and can only be absorbed through much personal exposure. In crafts or in sports this is more obvious. Tennis instructors, for example, can only reveal many secrets of their skills by demonstrating things before their pupils' eyes. But this process of absorption is also relevant to nonmanual skills. It was only through constant exposure to Davy's thought process that Faraday understood the power of finding the crucial experiment to demonstrate an idea, something he would adapt later on with great success. As the relationship progresses you can make this absorption process more conscious and direct, questioning them about the principles underlying their way of doing things. If you are clever, you can be a kind of midwife, getting them to analyze their own creativity for you, and mining all kinds of rich ideas in the process. They are often grateful for the opportunity to reveal the inner workings of their power, particularly to someone they do not perceive as a threat. Although one mentor at a time is best, it is not always possible to find the perfect one. In such a case, an alternate strategy is to find several mentors in your immediate environment, each one filling strategic gaps in your knowledge and experience. Having more than one mentor has side benefits, giving you several connections and important allies to rely upon later on. Similarly, if your circumstances limit your contacts, books can serve as temporary mentors, as The Improvement of the Mind did for Faraday. In such a case you will want to convert such books and writers into living mentors as much as possible. You personalize their voice, interact with the material, taking note of some of his weaknesses or character flaws, or even finding fault with his most cherished beliefs. Establishing your differences with the mentor is an important part of your self-development, whether he is of the good or bad parent type. In any event, you will probably have several mentors in your life, like stepping-stones along the way to mastery. At each phase of life you must find the appropriate teachers, getting what you want out of them, moving on, and feeling no shame for this. It is the path your own mentor probably took, and it is the way of the world.

One repays a teacher badly if one remains only at the level of gratitude. One must walk through the gate which the teacher opens by giving a large amount of trust to students and allowing them the freedom to walk their own paths. This is what the true mentor does, he allows you the freedom to grow. He does not make decisions for you. He lets you fail. And he allows you to succeed. He allows you to stumble along your own path and then picks you up when you fall down, teaches you from those experiences and sends you back out on the field to try again. This is how true mentors operate.

Another strategy for deepening the mentor dynamic is through constant communication and feedback. This involves regular check-ins with the mentor, seeking their advice and guidance, and then implementing that advice in your own life. It's also important to be open and honest about your progress, successes, and failures, as well as asking for constructive criticism and receiving it gracefully.

A third strategy is to take action on what you learn from the mentor. This could involve taking on a new project or challenge in your field of study, or experimenting with new ideas or techniques that your mentor has shared with you. By doing so, you are demonstrating not only your commitment to growth and development, but also your willingness to take risks and step outside of your comfort zone.

Finally, it's important to remember that the mentor-mentee relationship is a dynamic one, and that both parties must contribute actively to its success. A good mentor will provide guidance, support, and encouragement, but they cannot force you to grow or make progress in your field of study. Ultimately, the success of the mentor-mentee relationship depends on your own willingness to take ownership of your own growth and development, and to apply what you learn from your mentor in a meaningful way.
