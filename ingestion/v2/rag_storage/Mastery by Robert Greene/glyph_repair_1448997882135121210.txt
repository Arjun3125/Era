The text is about the process of mastering a skill or subject and achieving a feeling of heightened creativity, power, and command over reality. The author calls this sensation "mastery" and describes how it can be achieved through three distinct phases or levels: Apprenticeship, Creative-Active, and Mastery.

In the Apprenticeship phase, one learns the basic elements and rules of a field but has only a partial understanding and limited powers. In the Creative-Active phase, through practice and immersion, one gains a more comprehensive understanding and develops the ability to experiment and creatively play with the elements involved. Finally, in the Mastery phase, one's knowledge, experience, and focus become so deep that they can see the whole picture with complete clarity and access the essence of reality.

The author suggests that intuition is the key to achieving mastery; it is a sudden and immediate seizing of what is real without the need for words or formulas. Intuitive powers at the mastery level are a mix of instinctive and rational, conscious and unconscious, human and animal. By reconnecting with our childlike state and intuition, we can make sudden and powerful connections to our environment, allowing us to think and feel inside things and achieve true mastery in our field or subject.
