The text seems to be talking about several common patterns or shorthands and how you can subvert them. The passage suggests that looking at the "how" instead of the "what" means focusing on structure, which is the way parts relate to the whole. The text also advises paying more attention to details, immersing yourself in the small picture, and not overlooking anomalies. Lastly, it encourages fixating on what is absent rather than present.
