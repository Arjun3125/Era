    "raw_text": "Shop Class as Soulcraft\nMatthew B. Crawford\nSUMMER 2006 ~ 7\nAnyone in the market for a good used machine tool should talk to Noel \nDempsey , a dealer in Richmond, Virginia. Noel’s bustling warehouse is \nfull of metal lathes, milling machines, and table saws, and it turns out that \nmost of it is from schools. EBay is awash in such equipment, also from \nschools. It appears shop class is becoming a thing of the past, as educators \nprepare students to become “knowledge workers.” \nAt the same time, an engineering culture has developed in recent years \nin which the object is to “hide the works,” rendering the artifacts we use \nunintelligible to direct inspection. Lift the hood on some cars now (espe-\ncially German ones), and the engine appears a bit like the shimmering, \nfeatureless obelisk that so enthralled the cavemen in the opening scene of \nthe movie 2001: A Space Odyssey. Essentially , there is another hood under \nthe hood. This creeping concealedness takes various forms. The fasteners \nholding small appliances together now often require esoteric screwdrivers \nnot commonly available, apparently to prevent the curious or the angry \nfrom interrogating the innards. By way of contrast, older readers will \nrecall that until recent decades, Sears catalogues included blown-up parts \ndiagrams and conceptual schematics for all appliances and many other \nmechanical goods. It was simply taken for granted that such information \nwould be demanded by the consumer. \nA decline in tool use would seem to betoken a shift in our mode of \ninhabiting the world: more passive and more dependent. And indeed, \nthere are fewer occasions for the kind of spiritedness that is called forth \nwhen we take things in hand for ourselves, whether to fix them or to \nmake them. What ordinary people once made, they buy; and what they \nonce fixed for themselves, they replace entirely or hire an expert to repair, \nwhose expert fix often involves installing a pre-made replacement part. \nSo perhaps the time is ripe for reconsideration of an ideal that has \nfallen out of favor: manual competence, and the stance it entails toward \nthe built, material world. Neither as workers nor as consumers are we \nmuch called upon to exercise such competence, most of us anyway , and \nMatthew B. Crawford is a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute for Advanced Studies in \nCulture at the University of Virginia and a contributing editor of The New Atlantis. He \nwould like to thank Joe Davis and David Franz, both of the Institute, for their contributions \nto this article.\nCopyright 2006. All rights reserved.

But \nwe might pause to consider just how hard-headed these presumptions \nare, and whether they don’t, on the contrary , issue from a peculiar sort of \nidealism, one that insistently steers young people toward the most ghostly \nkinds of work.\nJudging from my admittedly cursory survey , articles began to appear \nin vocational education journals around 1985 with titles such as “The \nSoaring Technology Revolution” and “Preparing Kids for High-Tech \nand the Global Future.” Of course, there is nothing new about American \nfuture-ism. What is new is the wedding of future-ism to what might be \ncalled “virtualism”: a vision of the future in which we somehow take leave \nof material reality and glide about in a pure information economy. New \nand yet not so new—for fifty years now we’ve been assured that we are \nheaded for a “post-industrial economy.” While manufacturing jobs have \ncertainly left our shores to a disturbing degree, the manual trades have \nnot. If you need a deck built, or your car fixed, the Chinese are of no help. \nBecause they are in China. And in fact there are reported labor shortages \nin both construction and auto repair. Yet the trades and manufacturing \nare lumped together in the mind of the pundit class as “blue collar,” and \ntheir requiem is intoned. Even so, the Wall Street Journal recently won-\ndered whether “skilled [manual] labor is becoming one of the few sure \npaths to a good living.” This possibility was brought to light for many \nby the bestseller The Millionaire Next Door, which revealed that the typi-\ncal millionaire is the guy driving a pickup, with his own business in the \ntrades. My real concern here is not with the economics of skilled manual \nwork, but rather with its intrinsic satisfactions. I mention these economic \nrumors only to raise a suspicion against the widespread prejudice that \nsuch work is somehow not viable as a livelihood.\nThe Psychic Appeal of Manual Work \nI began working as an electrician’s helper at age fourteen, and started a \nsmall electrical contracting business after college, in Santa Barbara. In \nthose years I never ceased to take pleasure in the moment, at the end of a \njob, when I would flip the switch. “ And there was light.” It was an experi-\nence of agency and competence. The effects of my work were visible for all\n\f\nSUMMER 2006 ~ 9\nSHOP CLASS AS SOULCRAFT\nCopyright 2006. All rights reserved.

The well-founded pride of the tradesman is far from the gratuitous “self-\nesteem” that educators would impart to students, as though by magic.\nI was sometimes quieted at the sight of a gang of conduit entering \na large panel in a commercial setting, bent into nestled, flowing curves, \nwith varying offsets, that somehow all terminated in the same plane. This \nwas a skill so far beyond my abilities that I felt I was in the presence of \nsome genius, and the man who bent that conduit surely imagined this \nmoment of recognition as he worked. As a residential electrician, most of \nmy work got covered up inside walls. Yet even so, there is pride in meet-\ning the aesthetic demands of a workmanlike installation. Maybe another \nelectrician will see it someday. Even if not, one feels responsible to one’s \nbetter self. Or rather, to the thing itself—craftsmanship might be defined \nsimply as the desire to do something well, for its own sake. If the primary \nsatisfaction is intrinsic and private in this way , there is nonetheless a sort \nof self-disclosing that takes place. As Alexandre Kojève writes:\nThe man who works recognizes his own product in the World that has \nactually been transformed by his work: he recognizes himself in it, he \nsees in it his own human reality , in it he discovers and reveals to oth-\ners the objective reality of his humanity , of the originally abstract and \npurely subjective idea he has of himself.\nThe satisfactions of manifesting oneself concretely in the world \nthrough manual competence have been known to make a man quiet and \neasy. They seem to relieve him of the felt need to offer chattering interpre-\ntations of himself to vindicate his worth. He can simply point: the building \nstands, the car now runs, the lights are on. Boasting is what a boy does, \nwho has no real effect in the world. But craftsmanship must reckon with \nthe infallible judgment of reality , where one’s failures or shortcomings \ncannot be interpreted away.\nHobbyists will tell you that making one’s own furniture is hard to \njustify economically. And yet they persist. Shared memories attach to the \nmaterial souvenirs of our lives, and producing them is a kind of commu-\nnion, with others and with the future. Finding myself at loose ends one \nsummer in Berkeley , I built a mahogany coffee table on which I spared no \nexpense of effort. At that time I had no immediate prospect of becoming a \nfather, yet I imagined a child who would form indelible impressions of this \ntable and know that it was his father’s work. I imagined the table fading \ninto the background of a future life, the defects in its execution as well \nas inevitable stains and scars becoming a surface textured enough that\n\f\n10 ~ THE NEW ATLANTIS\nMATTHEW B.

More \nfundamentally , the durable objects of use produced by men “give rise to \nthe familiarity of the world, its customs and habits of intercourse between \nmen and things as well as between men and men,” as Hannah Arendt says. \n“The reality and reliability of the human world rest primarily on the fact \nthat we are surrounded by things more permanent than the activity by \nwhich they were produced, and potentially even more permanent than the \nlives of their authors.”\nBecause craftsmanship refers to objective standards that do not issue \nfrom the self and its desires, it poses a challenge to the ethic of consumer-\nism, as the sociologist Richard Sennett has recently argued. The crafts-\nman is proud of what he has made, and cherishes it, while the consumer \ndiscards things that are perfectly serviceable in his restless pursuit of the \nnew. The craftsman is then more possessive, more tied to what is pres-\nent, the dead incarnation of past labor; the consumer is more free, more \nimaginative, and so more valorous according to those who would sell us \nthings. Being able to think materially about material goods, hence criti-\ncally , gives one some independence from the manipulations of marketing, \nwhich typically divert attention from what a thing is  to a back-story inti-\nmated through associations, the point of which is to exaggerate minor \ndifferences between brands. Knowing the production narrative, or at \nleast being able to plausibly imagine it, renders the social narrative of the \nadvertisement less potent. The tradesman has an impoverished fantasy \nlife compared to the ideal consumer; he is more utilitarian and less given \nto soaring hopes. But he is also more autonomous.\nThis would seem to be significant for any political typology. Political \ntheorists from Aristotle to Thomas Jefferson have questioned the repub-\nlican virtue of the mechanic, finding him too narrow in his concerns to \nbe moved by the public good. Yet this assessment was made before the \nfull flowering of mass communication and mass conformity , which pose \na different set of problems for the republican character: enervation of \njudgment and erosion of the independent spirit. Since the standards of \ncraftsmanship issue from the logic of things rather than the art of persua-\nsion, practiced submission to them perhaps gives the craftsman some psy-\nchic ground to stand on against fantastic hopes aroused by demagogues, \nwhether commercial or political. The craftsman’s habitual deference is \nnot toward the New, but toward the distinction between the Right Way \nand the Wrong Way. However narrow in its application, this is a rare \nappearance in contemporary life—a disinterested, articulable, and pub-\nlicly affirmable idea of the good. Such a strong ontology is somewhat at\n\f\nSUMMER 2006 ~ 11\nSHOP CLASS AS SOULCRAFT\nCopyright 2006. All rights reserved.

The \negalitarian worry that has always attended tracking students into “college \nprep” and “vocational ed” is overlaid with another: the fear that acquir-\ning a specific skill set means that one’s life is determined. In college, by \ncontrast, many students don’t learn anything of particular application; \ncollege is the ticket to an open future. Craftsmanship entails learning \nto do one thing really well, while the ideal of the new economy is to be \nable to learn new things, celebrating potential rather than achievement. \nSomehow, every worker in the cutting-edge workplace is now supposed \nto act like an “intrapreneur,” that is, to be actively involved in the continu-\nous redefinition of his own job. Shop class presents an image of stasis that \nruns directly counter to what Richard Sennett identifies as “a key element \nin the new economy’s idealized self: the capacity to surrender, to give up \npossession of an established reality.” This stance toward “established real-\nity ,” which can only be called psychedelic, is best not indulged around a \ntable saw. It is dissatisfied with what Arendt calls the “reality and reliabil-\nity” of the world. It is a strange sort of ideal, attractive only to a peculiar \nsort of self—gratuitous ontological insecurity is no fun for most people.\nAs Sennett argues, most people take pride in being good at some-\nthing specific, which happens through the accumulation of experience. \nYet the flitting disposition is pressed upon workers from above by the \ncurrent generation of management revolutionaries, for whom the ethic of \ncraftsmanship is actually something to be rooted out from the workforce. \nCraftsmanship means dwelling on a task for a long time and going deeply \ninto it, because one wants to get it right. In management-speak, this is \ncalled being “ingrown.” The preferred role model is the management con-\nsultant, who swoops in and out, and whose very pride lies in his lack of \nparticular expertise. Like the ideal consumer, the management consultant \npresents an image of soaring freedom, in light of which the manual trades \nappear cramped and paltry.\nThe Cognitive Demands of Manual Work\nIn The Mind at Work , Mike Rose provides “cognitive biographies” of \nseveral trades, and depicts the learning process in a wood shop class. He \nwrites that “our testaments to physical work are so often focused on the \nvalues such work exhibits rather than on the thought it requires. It is a\n\f\n12 ~ THE NEW ATLANTIS\nMATTHEW B.

The steam engine is a good example. It was developed \nby mechanics who observed the relations between volume, pressure, and \ntemperature. This at a time when theoretical scientists were tied to the \ncaloric theory of heat, which later turned out to be a conceptual dead end. \nThe success of the steam engine contributed to the development of what \nwe now call classical thermodynamics. This history provides a nice illus-\ntration of a point made by Aristotle:\nLack of experience diminishes our power of taking a comprehensive \nview of the admitted facts. Hence those who dwell in intimate associa-\ntion with nature and its phenomena are more able to lay down princi-\nples such as to admit of a wide and coherent development; while those \nwhom devotion to abstract discussions has rendered unobservant of \nfacts are too ready to dogmatize on the basis of a few observations.\nAnother example is the Vernier scale used on machinists’ calipers and \nmicrometers. Invented in 1631, it is a sort of mechanical calculus that \nrenders continuous measurement in discrete digital approximation to \nfour decimal places. Such inventions capture a reflective moment in which \nsome skilled worker has made explicit the assumptions that are implicit \nin his manual skill.\nIn what has to be the best article ever published in an education jour-\nnal, the cognitive scientists Mike Eisenberg and Ann Nishioka Eisenberg \ngive real pedagogical force to this reflective moment, and draw out its \ntheoretical implications (“Shop Class for the Next Millennium: Education \nThrough Computer-Enriched Handicrafts,” in the Journal of Interactive \nMedia in Education). They offer a computer program to facilitate making \norigami, or rather Archimedean solids, by unfolding these solids into two \ndimensions. But they then have their students actually make the solids, \nout of paper cut according to the computer’s instructions. “Computational \ntools for crafting are entities poised somewhere between the abstract,\n\f\nSUMMER 2006 ~ 13\nSHOP CLASS AS SOULCRAFT\nCopyright 2006.

Figure 7 shows an example. Here, we \nare trying to create an approximation to a cone—a pyramid on a regu-\nlar octagonal base. HyperGami provides us with a folding net that will, \nindeed, produce a pyramid; but typically , no paper crafter would come \nup with a net of this sort, since it is fiendishly hard to join together \nthose eight tall triangles into a single vertex. In fact, this is an illustra-\ntive example of a more general idea—the difficulty of formalizing, in \npurely mathematical terms, what it means to produce a ‘realistic’ (and \nnot merely technically correct) solution to an algorithmic problem \nderived from human practice.\nI take their point to be that the crafting problem is in fact not reducible \nto an algorithmic problem. More precisely , any algorithmic solution to \nthe crafting problem cannot itself be generated algorithmically , as it must \ninclude ad hoc constraints known only through practice, that is, through \nembodied manipulations. Those constraints cannot be arrived at deductive-\nly , starting from mathematical entities. It is worth noting in passing that \nthis has implications for the theory of mind favored by artificial intelligence \nresearchers, as it speaks to the “computability” of pragmatic cognition. It \nwould be a task for cognitive science to determine if these considerations \nplace a theoretical limit on the automation of work, but I can speak first-\nhand to how one area of work is resistant to algorithmic thinking.\nFollowing graduate school in Chicago, I took a job in a Washington, \nD.C. think tank. I hated it, so I left and opened a motorcycle repair shop \nin Richmond. When I would come home from work, my wife would sniff \nat me and say “carbs” or “brakes,” corresponding to the various solvents \nused. Leaving a sensible trace, my day was at least imaginable to her. But \nwhile the filth and odors were apparent, the amount of head-scratching \nI’d done since breakfast was not. Mike Rose writes that in the practice \nof surgery , “dichotomies such as concrete versus abstract and technique \nversus reflection break down in practice. The surgeon’s judgment is \nsimultaneously technical and deliberative, and that mix is the source of its\n\f\n14 ~ THE NEW ATLANTIS\nMATTHEW B. CRAWFORD\nCopyright 2006. All rights reserved.

You come up with an imagined train of causes for \nmanifest symptoms and judge their likelihood before tearing anything \ndown. This imagining relies on a stock mental library , not of natural kinds \nor structures, like that of the surgeon, but rather the functional kinds of \nan internal combustion engine, their various interpretations by different \nmanufacturers, and their proclivities for failure. You also develop a library \nof sounds and smells and feels. For example, the backfire of a too-lean \nfuel mixture is subtly different from an ignition backfire. If the motor-\ncycle is thirty years old, from an obscure maker that went out of business \ntwenty years ago, its proclivities are known mostly through lore. It would \n probably be impossible to do such work in isolation, without access to a \ncollective historical memory; you have to be embedded in a community of \nmechanic-antiquarians. These relationships are maintained by telephone, \nin a network of reciprocal favors that spans the country. My most reliable \nsource, Fred Cousins in Chicago, had such an encyclopedic knowledge of \nobscure European motorcycles that all I could offer him in exchange was \nregular shipments of obscure European beer. \nThere is always a risk of introducing new complications when work-\ning on decrepit machines, and this enters the diagnostic logic. Measured \nin likelihood of screw-ups, the cost is not identical for all avenues of \ninquiry when deciding which hypothesis to pursue. For example, the fas-\nteners holding the engine covers on 1970s-era Hondas are Phillips-head, \nand they are always stripped and corroded. Do you really want to check the \ncondition of the starter clutch, if each of ten screws will need to be drilled \nout and extracted, risking damage to the engine case? Such impediments \ncan cloud one’s thinking. Put more neutrally , the attractiveness of any \nhypothesis is determined in part by physical circumstances that have no \nlogical connection to the diagnostic problem at hand, but a strong prag-\nmatic bearing on it (kind of like origami). The factory service manuals \ntell you to be systematic in eliminating variables, but they never take such \nfactors into account. So you have to develop your own decision tree for \nthe particular circumstances. The problem is that at each node of this new \ntree, your own, unquantifiable risk aversion introduces ambiguity. There \ncomes a point where you have to step back and get a larger gestalt. Have \na cigarette and walk around the lift. Any mechanic will tell you that it is \ninvaluable to have other mechanics around to test your reasoning against, \nespecially if they have a different intellectual disposition.\nMy shop-mate Tommy Van Auken was an accomplished visual art-\nist, and I was repeatedly struck by his ability to literally see things that\n\f\nSummer 2006 ~ 15\nShop Class as Soulcraft\nescaped me. I had the conceit of a being an empiricist, but seeing things \nis not a simple matter. Even on the relatively primitive vintage bikes that \nwere our specialty , some diagnostic situations contain so many variables, \nand symptoms can be so under-determining of causes, that explicit analyt-\nical reasoning comes up short. What is required then is the kind of judg-\nment that arises only from experience; hunches rather than rules. There \nwas more thinking going on in the bike shop than in the think tank.\nSocially , being the proprietor of a bike shop in a small city gave me a \nfeeling I never had before. I felt I had a place in society. Whereas “think \ntank” is an answer that, at best, buys you a few seconds when someone \nasks what you do, while you try to figure out what it is that you in fact \ndo, with “motorcycle mechanic” I got immediate recognition. I bartered \nservices with machinists and metal fabricators, which has a very differ-\nent feel than transactions with money , and further increased my sense \nof social embeddedness. There were three restaurants with cooks whose \nbikes I had restored, where unless I deceive myself I was treated as a sage \nbenefactor. I felt pride before my wife when we would go out to dinner and \nbe given preferential treatment, or simply a hearty greeting. There were \ngroup rides, and bike night every Tuesday at a certain bar. Sometimes one \nor two people would be wearing my shop’s T-shirt. It felt good. \nGiven the intrinsic richness of manual work, cognitively , socially , and \nin its broader psychic appeal, the question becomes why it has suffered \nsuch a devaluation in recent years as a component of education. The eco-\nnomic rationale so often offered, namely that manual work is somehow \ngoing to disappear, is questionable if not preposterous, so it is in the \nmurky realm of culture that we must look to understand these things. To \nthis end, perhaps we need to consider the origins of shop class, so that we \ncan better understand its demise.\nArts, Crafts, and the Assembly Line\nAt a time when Teddy Roosevelt preached the strenuous life and elites \nworried about their state of “over-civilized” spiritual decay , the project of \ngetting back in touch with “real life” took various forms. One was romantic \nfantasy about the pre-modern craftsman. This was understandable given \nchanges in the world of work at the turn of the century , a time when the \nbureaucratization of economic life was rapidly increasing the number of \npaper shufflers. The tangible elements of craft were appealing as an anti-\ndote to vague feelings of unreality , diminished autonomy , and a fragmented \nsense of self that were especially acute among the professional classes.\nCopyright 2006.

See www.TheNewAtlantis.com for more information.\nThe Arts and Crafts movement thus fit easily with the new thera-\npeutic ethic of self-regeneration. Depleted from his workweek in the \ncorporate world, the office worker repaired to his basement workshop \nto putter about and tinker, refreshing himself for the following week. As \nT. J. Jackson Lears writes in his history of the Progressive era, No Place \nof Grace, “toward the end of the nineteenth century , many beneficiaries of \nmodern culture began to feel they were its secret victims.” Various forms \nof antimodernism gained wide currency in the middle and upper classes, \nincluding the ethic of craftsmanship. Some Arts and Crafts enthusiasts con-\nceived their task to be evangelizing good taste as embodied in the works \nof craft, as against machine-age vulgarity. Cultivating an appreciation for \nobjets d’art was thus a form of protest against modernity , with a view to \nproviding a livelihood to dissident craftsmen. But it dovetailed with, and \ngave a higher urgency to, the nascent culture of luxury consumption. As \nLears tells the story , the great irony is that antimodernist sentiments of \naesthetic revolt against the machine paved the way for certain unattractive \nfeatures of late-modern culture: therapeutic self-absorption and the han-\nkering after “authenticity ,” precisely those psychic hooks now relied upon \nby advertisers. Such spiritualized, symbolic modes of craft practice and \ncraft consumption represented a kind of compensation for, and therefore \nan accommodation to, new modes of routinized, bureaucratic work.\nBut not everyone worked in an office. Indeed, there was class con-\nflict brewing, with unassimilated immigrants accumulating in America’s \nEastern cities and serious labor violence in Chicago and elsewhere. To the \nupper classes of those same cities, enamored of the craft ideal, the possibil-\nity presented itself that the laboring classes might remain satisfied with \ntheir material lot if they found joy in their labor. Shop class could serve to \nput the proper spin on manual work. Any work, it was posited, could be \n“artful” if done in the proper spirit; somehow a movement that had started \nwith reverence for the craftsman now offered an apologetic for factory \nwork. As Lears writes, “By shifting their attention from the conditions of \nlabor to the laborer’s frame of mind, craft ideologues could acclaim the \nvalue of any work, however monotonous.” \nThe Smith-Hughes Act of 1917 gave federal funding for manual train-\ning in two forms: as part of general education and as a separate vocational \nprogram. The invention of modern shop class thus serviced both cultural \nreflexes of the Arts and Crafts movement at once. The children of the \nmanagerial class could take shop as enrichment to the college-prep cur-\nriculum, making a bird-feeder to hang outside mom’s kitchen window, \nwhile the children of laborers would be socialized into the work ethic\n\f\nSUMMER 2006 ~ 17\nSHOP CLASS AS SOULCRAFT\nCopyright 2006.

The need for such socialization was not simply a mat-\nter of assimilating immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe who \nlacked a Protestant work ethic. It was recognized as a necessity for the \nbroader working-class population, precisely because the institutions that \nhad previously served this socializing function, apprenticeship and guild \ntraditions, had been destroyed by new modes of labor. Writing in 1918, \none Robert Hoxie worried thus: \nIt is evident...t h a t  t h e  n a t i v e  efficiency of the working class must suf-\nfer from the neglect of apprenticeship, if no other means of industrial \neducation is forthcoming. Scientific managers, themselves, have com-\nplained bitterly of the poor and lawless material from which they must \nrecruit their workers, compared with the efficient and self-respecting \ncraftsmen who applied for employment twenty years ago.\nNeedless to say , “scientific managers” were concerned more with the \n“efficient” part of this formula than with the “self-respecting” part, yet \nthe two are not independent. The quandary was how to make workers \nefficient and attentive, when their actual labor had been degraded by \nautomation. The motivation previously supplied by the intrinsic satisfac-\ntions of manual work was to be replaced with ideology; industrial arts \neducation now concerned itself with moral formation. Lears writes that \n“ American craft publicists, by treating craftsmanship . . . as an agent of \nsocialization, abandoned [the] effort to revive pleasurable labor. Manual \ntraining meant specialized assembly line preparation for the lower classes \nand educational or recreational experiences for the bourgeoisie.” \nOf the Smith-Hughes Act’s two rationales for shop class, vocational \nand general ed, only the latter emphasized the learning of aesthetic, math-\nematical, and physical principles through the manipulation of material \nthings (Dewey’s “learning by doing”). It is not surprising, then, that the \nact came four years after Henry Ford’s innovation of the assembly line. \nThe act’s dual educational scheme mirrored the assembly line’s sever-\ning of the cognitive aspects of manual work from its physical execution. \nSuch a partition of thinking from doing has bequeathed us the dichotomy \nof “white collar” versus “blue collar,” corresponding to mental versus \nmanual. These seem to be the categories that inform the educational land-\nscape even now, and this entails two big errors. First, it assumes that all \nblue collar work is as mindless as assembly line work, and second, that \nwhite collar work is still recognizably mental in character. Yet there is \nevidence to suggest that the new frontier of capitalism lies in doing to\n\f\n18 ~ THE NEW ATLANTIS\nMATTHEW B. CRAWFORD\nCopyright 2006. All rights reserved. See www.TheNewAtlantis.com for more information.\noffice work what was previously done to factory work: draining it of its \ncognitive elements. Paradoxically , educators who would steer students \ntoward cognitively rich work options might do this best by rehabilitating \nthe manual trades, based on a firmer grasp of what such work is really \nlike.  And would this not be in keeping with their democratic mission?  Let \nthem publicly honor those who gain real craft knowledge, the sort we all \ndepend on every day.\nThe Degradation of Blue-Collar Work\nThe degradation of work in the last century is often tied to the evils of \ntechnology in one way or another. And it is certainly true that “techni-\ncal progress has multiplied the number of simplified jobs,” as one French \nsociologist wrote in the 1950s. This writer pointed out a resemblance \nbetween the Soviet bloc and the Western bloc with regard to work; both \nrival civilizations were developing “that separation between planning and \nexecution which seems to be in our day a common denominator linking \nall industrial societies together.” Yet while technology plays a role in \nfacilitating this separation of planning and execution, the basic logic that \ndrives the separation rests not on technological progress, but rather on \na certain mode of economic relations, as Harry Braverman has shown in \nhis masterpiece of economic reflection, Labor and Monopoly Capital: The \nDegradation of Work in the Twentieth Century . Braverman was an avowed \nMarxist, writing in 1974. With the Cold War now safely decided, we may \nconsider anew, without defensive ire, the Marxian account of alienated \nlabor. Braverman gives a richly descriptive account of the degradation of \nmany different kinds of work. In doing so, he offers nothing less than an \nexplanation of why we are getting more stupid with every passing year—\nwhich is to say , the degradation of work is ultimately a cognitive matter. \nThe central culprit in Braverman’s account is “scientific manage-\nment,” which “enters the workplace not as the representative of science, \nbut as the representative of management masquerading in the trappings \nof science.” The tenets of scientific management were given their first \nand frankest articulation by Frederick Winslow Taylor, an unembar-\nrassed evangelist of efficiency whose Principles of Scientific Management  \nwas hugely influential in the early decades of the twentieth century. Stalin \nwas a big fan, as were the founders of the first MBA program, at Harvard, \nwhere Taylor was invited to lecture annually. Taylor writes, “The man-\nagers assume . . . the burden of gathering together all of the traditional \nknowledge which in the past has been possessed by the workmen and then\n\f\nSUMMER 2006 ~ 19\nSHOP CLASS AS SOULCRAFT\nCopyright 2006.

This \nprocess replaces what was previously an integral activity , rooted in craft \ntradition and experience, animated by the worker’s own mental image of, \nand intention toward, the finished product. Thus, according to Taylor, \n“ All possible brain work should be removed from the shop and centered \nin the planning or lay-out department.” It is a mistake to suppose that \nthe primary purpose of this partition is to render the work process more \nefficient. It may or may not result in extracting more value from a given \nunit of labor time. The concern is rather with labor cost. Once the cogni-\ntive aspects of the job are located in a separate management class, or bet-\nter yet in a process that, once designed, requires no ongoing judgment or \ndeliberation, skilled workers can be replaced with unskilled workers at a \nlower rate of pay. Taylor writes that the “full possibilities” of his system \n“will not have been realized until almost all of the machines in the shop \nare run by men who are of smaller caliber and attainments, and who are \ntherefore cheaper than those required under the old system.”\nWhat becomes of the skilled workers? They go elsewhere, of course. \nBut the competitive labor-cost advantage now held by the more modern \nfirm, which has aggressively separated planning from execution, compels \nthe whole industry to follow the same route, and entire skilled trades \ndisappear. Thus craft knowledge dies out, or rather gets instantiated in a \ndifferent form, as process engineering knowledge. The conception of the \nwork is remote from the worker who does it. \n Scientific management introduced the use of “time and motion \nanalysis” to describe the physiological capabilities of the human body \nin machine terms. As Braverman writes, “the more labor is governed by \nclassified motions which extend across the boundaries of trades and occu-\npations, the more it dissolves its concrete forms into the general types of \nwork motions. This mechanical exercise of human faculties according to \nmotion types which are studied independently of the particular kind of \nwork being done, brings to life the Marxist conception of ‘abstract labor.’” \nThe clearest example of abstract labor is thus the assembly line. The \nactivity (in the Aristotelian sense) of self-directed labor, conducted by the \nworker, is dissolved into abstract parts and then reconstituted as a process \ncontrolled by management.\nAt the turn of the last century , the manufacture of automobiles was \ndone by craftsmen recruited from bicycle and carriage shops: all-around\n\f\n20 ~ THE NEW ATLANTIS\nMATTHEW B.

In The Wheelwright’s Shop , \nGeorge Sturt relates his experience in taking over his family business \nof making wheels for carriages, in 1884, shortly before the advent of the \nautomobile. He had been a school teacher with literary ambitions, but \nnow finds himself almost overwhelmed by the cognitive demands of his \nnew trade. In Sturt’s shop, working exclusively with hand tools, the skills \nrequired to build a wheel regress all the way to the selection of trees to fell \nfor timber, the proper time for felling them, how to season them, and so \nforth. To select but one minor task out of the countless he describes, here \nis Sturt’s account of fabricating a part of a wheel’s rim called a felloe:\nYet it is in vain to go into details at this point; for when the simple \napparatus had all been gotten together for one simple-looking process, \na never-ending series of variations was introduced by the material. \nWhat though two felloes might seem much alike when finished? It \nwas the wheelwright himself who had to make them so. He it was \nwho hewed out that resemblance from quite dissimilar blocks, for no \ntwo  felloe-blocks were ever alike. Knots here, shakes there, rind-galls, \nwaney edges (edges with more or less bark in them), thicknesses, thin-\nnesses, were for ever affording new chances or forbidding previous \nsolutions, whereby a fresh problem confronted the workman’s ingenu-\nity every few minutes. He had no band-saw (as now [1923]) to drive, \nwith ruthless unintelligence, through every resistance. The timber was \nfar from being prey , a helpless victim, to a machine. Rather it would \nlend its own special virtues to the man who knew how to humour it.\nGiven their likely acquaintance with such a cognitively rich world of \nwork, it is hardly surprising that when Henry Ford introduced the assem-\nbly line in 1913, workers simply walked out. One of Ford’s biographers \nwrote, “So great was labor’s distaste for the new machine system that \ntoward the close of 1913 every time the company wanted to add 100 men \nto its factory personnel, it was necessary to hire 963.” \nThis would seem to be a crucial moment in the history of political \neconomy. Evidently , the new system provoked natural revulsion. Yet, at \nsome point, workers became habituated to it. How did this happen? One \nmight be tempted to inquire in a typological mode: What sort of men \nwere these first, the 100 out of 963 who stuck it out on the new assembly \nline? Perhaps it was the men who felt less revulsion because they had less \npride in their own powers, and were therefore more tractable. Less repub-\nlican, we might say. But if there was initially such a self-selection process, \nit quickly gave way to something less deliberate, more systemic.\n\f\nSUMMER 2006 ~ 21\nSHOP CLASS AS SOULCRAFT\nCopyright 2006.

See www.TheNewAtlantis.com for more information.\nIn a temporary suspension of the Taylorist logic, Ford was forced \nto double the daily wage of his workers to keep the line staffed. As \nBraverman writes, this “opened up new possibilities for the intensification \nof labor within the plants, where workers were now anxious to keep their \njobs.” These anxious workers were more productive. Indeed, Ford him-\nself later recognized his wage increase as “one of the finest cost-cutting \nmoves we ever made,” as he was able to double, and then triple, the rate \nat which cars were assembled by simply speeding up the conveyors. By \ndoing so he destroyed his competitors, and thereby destroyed the possibil-\nity of an alternative way of working. (It also removed the wage pressure \nthat comes from the existence of more enjoyable jobs.) At the Columbian \nWorld Expo held in Chicago in 1893, no fewer than seven large-scale \ncarriage builders from Cincinnati alone presented their wares. Adopting \nFord’s methods, the industry would soon be reduced to the Big Three. So \nworkers eventually became habituated to the abstraction of the assembly \nline. Evidently , it inspires revulsion only if one is acquainted with more \nsatisfying modes of work.\nHere the concept of wages as compensation achieves its fullest meaning, \nand its central place in modern economy. Changing attitudes toward con-\nsumption seemed to play a role. A man whose needs are limited will find \nthe least noxious livelihood and work in a subsistence mode, and indeed the \nexperience of early (eighteenth-century) capitalism, when many producers \nworked at home on a piece-rate basis, was that only so much labor could be \nextracted from them. Contradicting the assumptions of “rational behavior” \nof classical economics, it was found that when employers would increase \nthe piece rate in order to boost production, it actually had the opposite \neffect: workers would produce less, as now they could meet their fixed \nneeds with less work. Eventually it was learned that the only way to get \nthem to work harder was to play upon the imagination, stimulating new \nneeds and wants. The habituation of workers to the assembly line was thus \nperhaps made easier by another innovation of the early twentieth century: \nconsumer debt. As Jackson Lears has shown in a recent article, through \nthe installment plan, previously unthinkable acquisitions became thinkable, \nand more than thinkable: it became normal to carry debt. The display of \na new car bought on installment became a sign that one was trustworthy. \nIn a wholesale transformation of the old Puritan moralism, expressed by \nBenjamin Franklin (admittedly no Puritan) with the motto “Be frugal and \nfree,” the early twentieth century saw the moral legitimation of spending. \nIndeed, 1907 saw the publication of a book with the immodest title The New \nBasis of Civilization, by Simon Nelson Patten, in which the moral valence\n\f\n22 ~ THE NEW ATLANTIS\nMATTHEW B. CRAWFORD\nCopyright 2006. All rights reserved. See www.TheNewAtlantis.com for more information.\nof debt and spending is reversed, and the multiplication of wants becomes \nnot a sign of dangerous corruption but part of the civilizing process. That \nis, part of the disciplinary process. As Lears writes, “Indebtedness could \ndiscipline workers, keeping them at routinized jobs in factories and offices, \ngraying but in harness, meeting payments regularly.”\nThe Degradation of White-Collar Work\nMuch of the “jobs of the future” rhetoric surrounding the eagerness to \nend shop class and get every warm body into college, thence into a cubicle, \nimplicitly assumes that we are heading to a “post-industrial” economy in \nwhich everyone will deal only in abstractions. Yet trafficking in abstrac-\ntions is not the same as thinking. White collar professions, too, are subject \nto routinization and degradation, proceeding by the same process as befell \nmanual fabrication a hundred years ago: the cognitive elements of the job \nare appropriated from professionals, instantiated in a system or process, and \nthen handed back to a new class of workers—clerks—who replace the pro-\nfessionals. If genuine knowledge work is not growing but actually shrink-\ning, because it is coming to be concentrated in an ever-smaller elite, this has \nimplications for the vocational advice that students ought to receive.\n“Expert systems,” a term coined by artificial intelligence research-\ners, were initially developed by the military for battle command, then \nused to replicate industrial expertise in such fields as oil-well drilling \nand telephone-line maintenance. Then they found their way into medical \ndiagnosis, and eventually the cognitively murky , highly lucrative, regions \nof financial and legal advice. In The Electronic Sweatshop: How Computers \nare Transforming the Office of the Future into the Factory of the Past, Barbara \nGarson details how “Extraordinary human ingenuity has been used to \neliminate the need for human ingenuity.” She finds that, like Taylor’s \nrationalization of the shop floor, the intention of expert systems is “to \ntransfer knowledge, skill, and decision making from employee to employ-\ner.” While Taylor’s time and motion studies broke every concrete work \nmotion into minute parts, \nThe modern knowledge engineer performs similar detailed studies, \nonly he anatomizes decision making rather than bricklaying. So the \ntime-and-motion study has become a time-and-thought study ....T o  \nbuild an expert system, a living expert is debriefed and then cloned by \na knowledge engineer. That is to say , an expert is interviewed, typi-\ncally for weeks or months. The knowledge engineer watches the expert \nwork on sample problems and asks exactly what factors the expert\n\f\nSUMMER 2006 ~ 23\nSHOP CLASS AS SOULCRAFT\nCopyright 2006. All rights reserved.

Eventually \nhundreds or thousands of rules of thumb are fed into the computer. \nThe result is a program that can ‘make decisions’ or ‘draw conclusions’ \nheuristically instead of merely calculating with equations. Like a real \nexpert, a sophisticated expert system should be able to draw inferences \nfrom ‘iffy’ or incomplete data that seems to suggest or tends to rule \nout. In other words it uses (or replaces) judgment.\nThe human expert who is cloned achieves a vast dominion and immor-\ntality , in a sense. It is other experts, and future experts, who are displaced \nas expertise is centralized. “This means that more people in the advice \nor human service business will be employed as the disseminators, rather \nthan the originators, of this advice,” Garson writes. In his 2006 book \nThe Culture of the New Capitalism , Richard Sennett describes just such a \n process, “especially in the cutting-edge realms of high finance, advanced \ntechnology , and sophisticated services”: genuine knowledge work comes \nto be concentrated in an ever-smaller elite. It seems we must take a cold-\neyed view of “knowledge work,” and reject the image of a rising sea of \npure mentation that lifts all boats. More likely is a rising sea of clerkdom. \nTo expect otherwise is to hope for a reversal in the basic logic of the mod-\nern economy—that is, cognitive stratification. It is not clear to me what \nthis hope could be based on, though if history is any guide we have to \nwonder whether the excitation of such a hope has become an instrument \nby which young people are prepared for clerkdom, in the same perverse \nway that the craft ideology prepared workers for the assembly line. Both \nprovide a lens that makes the work look appealing from afar, but only by \npresenting an image that is upside down.\nThe Craftsman as Stoic\nWe are recalled to the basic antagonism of economic life: work is toil-\nsome and necessarily serves someone else’s interests. That’s why you get \npaid. Thus chastened, we may ask the proper question: what is it that we \nreally want for a young person when we give them vocational advice? The \nonly creditable answer, it seems to me, is one that avoids utopianism while \nkeeping an eye on the human good: work that engages the human capaci-\nties as fully as possible. What I have tried to show is that this humane and \ncommonsensical answer goes against the central imperative of capitalism, \nwhich assiduously partitions thinking from doing. What is to be done? I \noffer no program, only an observation that might be of interest to anyone \ncalled upon to give guidance to the young.\n\f\n24 ~ THE NEW ATLANTIS\nMATTHEW B. CRAWFORD\nCopyright 2006. All rights reserved. See www.TheNewAtlantis.com for more information.\nSince manual work has been subject to routinization for over a century , \nthe nonroutinized manual work that remains, outside the confines of the \nfactory , would seem to be resistant to much further routinization. There \nstill appear developments around the margins; for example, in the last \ntwenty years pre-fabricated roof trusses have eliminated some of the more \nchallenging elements from the jobs of framers who work for large tract \ndevelopers, and pre-hung doors have done the same for finish carpenters \ngenerally. But still, the physical circumstances of the jobs performed by \ncarpenters, plumbers, and auto mechanics vary too much for them to be \nexecuted by idiots; they require circumspection and adaptability. One feels \nlike a man, not a cog in a machine. The trades are then a natural home \nfor anyone who would live by his own powers, free not only of deadening \nabstraction, but also of the insidious hopes and rising insecurities that \nseem to be endemic in our current economic life. This is the stoic ideal.\nSo what advice should one give to a young person? By all means, go \nto college. In fact, approach college in the spirit of craftsmanship, going \ndeep into liberal arts and sciences. In the summers, learn a manual trade. \nYou’re likely to be less damaged, and quite possibly better paid, as an \nindependent tradesman than as a cubicle-dwelling tender of information \nsystems. To heed such advice would require a certain contrarian streak, \nas it entails rejecting a life course mapped out by others as obligatory and \ninevitable."
