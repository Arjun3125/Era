To weave \nthese slender threads of a broken life into a firm pattern of meaning and responsibility is the object \nand challenge of logo-therapy, which is Dr. Frankl's own version of modern existential analysis. \nIn this book, Dr. Frankl explains the experience which led to his discovery of logotherapy. As a long-\ntime prisoner in bestial concentration camps he found himself stripped to naked existence. His \nfather, mother, brother, and his wife died in camps or were sent to the gas ovens, so that, excepting \nfor his sister, his entire family perished in these camps. How could he—every possession lost, every \nvalue destroyed, suffering from hunger, cold and brutality, hourly expecting extermination—how \ncould he find life worth preserving? A psychiatrist who personally has faced such extremity is a \npsychiatrist worth listening to. He, if anyone, should be able to view our human condition wisely and \nwith compassion. Dr. Frankl's words have a profoundly honest ring, for they rest on experiences too \ndeep for deception. What he has to say gains in prestige because of his present position on the \nMedical Faculty of the University of Vienna and because of the renown of the logotherapy clinics \nthat today are springing up in many lands, patterned on his own famous Neurological Policlinic in \nVienna. \n \nOne cannot help but compare Viktor Frankl's approach to theory and therapy with the work of his \npredecessor, Sigmund Freud. Both physicians concern themselves primarily with the nature and cure \nof neuroses. Freud finds the root of these distressing disorders in the anxiety caused by conflicting \nand unconscious motives. Frankl distinguishes several forms of neurosis, and traces some of them \n(the noogenic neuroses) to the failure of the sufferer to find meaning and a sense of responsibility in \nhis existence. Freud stresses frustration in the sexual life; Frankl, frustration in the \"will-to-meaning.\" \nIn Europe today there is a marked turning away from Freud and a widespread embracing of \nexistential analysis, which takes several related forms—the school of logotherapy being one. It is \ncharacteristic of Frankl's tolerant outlook that he does not repudiate Freud, but builds gladly on his \ncontributions; nor does he quarrel with other forms of existential therapy, but welcomes kinship \nwith them. \n \nThe present narrative, brief though it is, is artfully constructed and gripping. On two occasions I have \nread it through at a single sitting, unable to break away from its spell. Somewhere beyond the \nmidpoint of the story Dr. Frankl introduces his own philosophy of logotherapy. He introduces it so \ngently into the continuing narrative that only after finishing the book does the reader realize that \nhere is an essay of profound depth, and not just one more brutal tale of concentration camps. \nFrom this autobiographical fragment the reader learns much. He learns what a human being does \nwhen he suddenly realizes he has \"nothing to lose except his so ridiculously naked life.\" Frankl's \ndescription of the mixed flow of emotion and apathy is arresting. First to the rescue comes a cold \ndetached curiosity concerning one's fate. Swiftly, too, come strategies to preserve the remnants of \none's life, though the chances of surviving are slight. Hunger, humiliation, fear and deep anger at \ninjustice are rendered tolerable by closely guarded images of beloved persons, by religion, by a grim \nsense of humour, and even by glimpses of the healing beauties of nature—a tree or a sunset.  \nBut these moments of comfort do not establish the will to live unless they help the prisoner make \nlarger sense out of his apparently senseless suffering. It is here that we encounter the central theme \nof existentialism: to live is to suffer, to survive is to find meaning in the suffering. If there is a \npurpose in life at all, there must be a purpose in suffering and in dying. But no man can tell another \nwhat this purpose is. Each must find out for himself, and must accept the responsibility that his\n\f\nanswer prescribes. If he succeeds he will continue to grow in spite of all indignities. Frankl is fond of \nquoting Nietzsche, \"He who has a why to live can bear with almost any how.\" \n \nIn the concentration camp every circumstance conspires to make the prisoner lose his hold. All the \nfamiliar goals in life are snatched away. What alone remains is \"the last of human freedoms\"—the \nability to \"choose one's attitude in a given set of circumstances.\" This ultimate freedom, recognized \nby the ancient Stoics as well as by modern existentialists, takes on vivid significance in Frankl's story. \nThe prisoners were only average men, but some, at least, by choosing to be \"worthy of their \nsuffering\" proved man's capacity to rise above his outward fate. \n \nAs a psychotherapist, the author, of course, wants to know how men can be helped to achieve this \ndistinctively human capacity. How can one awaken in a patient the feeling that he is responsible to \nlife for something, however grim his circumstances may be? Frankl gives us a moving account of one \ncollective therapeutic session he held with his fellow prisoners. \n \nAt the publisher's request Dr. Frankl has added a statement of the basic tenets of logotherapy as \nwell as a bibliography. Up to now most of the publications of this \"Third Viennese School of \nPsychotherapy\" (the predecessors being the Freudian and Adlerian Schools) have been chiefly in \nGerman. The reader will therefore welcome Dr. Frankl's supplement to his personal narrative. \nUnlike many European existentialists, Frankl is neither pessimistic nor antireligious. On the contrary, \nfor a writer who faces fully the ubiquity of suffering and the forces of evil, he takes a surprisingly \nhopeful view of man's capacity to transcend his predicament and discover an adequate guiding \ntruth. \n \nI recommend this little book heartily, for it is a gem of dramatic narrative, focused upon the deepest \nof human problems. It has literary and philosophical merit and provides a compelling introduction to \nthe most significant psychological movement of our day. \n \nGORDON W. ALLPORT \n \n \nGordon W. Allport, formerly a professor of psychology at Harvard University, was one of the foremost writers and teachers \nin the field in this hemisphere. He was author of a large number of original works on psychology and was the editor of the \nJournal of Abnormal and Social Psychology. It is chiefly through the pioneering work of Professor Allport that Dr. Frankl's \nmomentous theory was introduced to this country; moreover, it is to his credit that the interest shown here in logotherapy \nis growing by leaps and bounds.\n\f\nPreface to the 1992Edition\n \nThis book has now lived to see nearly one hundred printings in English—in addition to having \nbeen published in twenty-one other languages. And the English editions alone have sold more than \nthree million copies. \n \nThese are the dry facts, and they may well be the reason why reporters of American newspapers and \nparticularly of American TV stations more often than not start their interviews, after listing these \nfacts, by exclaiming: \"Dr. Frankl, your book has become a true bestseller—how do you feel about \nsuch a success?\" Whereupon I react by reporting that in the first place I do not at all see in the \nbestseller status of my book an achievement and accomplishment on my part but rather an \nexpression of the misery of our time: if hundreds of thousands of people reach out for a book whose \nvery title promises to deal with the question of a meaning to life, it must be a question that burns \nunder their fingernails. \n \nTo be sure, something else may have contributed to the impact of the book: its second, theoretical \npart (\"Logotherapy in a Nutshell\") boils down, as it were, to the lesson one may distil from the first \npart, the autobiographical account (\"Experiences in a Concentration Camp\"), whereas PART ONE \nserves as the existential validation of my theories. Thus, both parts mutually support their credibility. \n \nI had none of this in mind when I wrote the book in 1945. And I did so within nine successive days \nand with the firm determination that the book should be published anonymously. In fact, the first \nprinting of the original German version does not show my name on the cover, though at the last \nmoment, just before the book's initial publication, I did finally give in to my friends who had urged \nme to let it be published with my name at least on the title page. At first, however, it had been \nwritten with the absolute conviction that, as an anonymous opus, it could never earn its author \nliterary fame. I had wanted simply to convey to the reader by way of a concrete example that life \nholds a potential meaning under any conditions, even the most miserable ones. And I thought that if \nthe point were demonstrated in a situation as extreme as that in a concentration camp, my book \nmight gain a hearing. I therefore felt responsible for writing down what I had gone through, for I \nthought it might be helpful to people who are prone to despair. \n \nAnd so it is both strange and remarkable to me that— among some dozens of books I have \nauthored—precisely this one, which I had intended to be published anonymously so that it could \nnever build up any reputation on the part of the author, did become a success. Again and again I \ntherefore admonish my students both in Europe and in America: \"Don't aim at success—the more \nyou aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, \ncannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one's \ndedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other \nthan oneself. Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by \nnot caring about it. I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to \ncarry it out to the best of \n \nyour knowledge. Then you will live to see that in the long run—in the long run, I say!—success will \nfollow you precisely because you had forgotten to think of it.\" \n \nThe reader may ask me why I did not try to escape what was in store for me after Hitler had \noccupied Austria. Let me answer by recalling the following story. Shortly before the United States \nentered World War II, I received an invitation to come to the American Consulate in Vienna to pick \nup my immigration visa. My old parents were overjoyed because they expected that I would soon be\n\f\nallowed to leave Austria. I suddenly hesitated, however. The question beset me: could I really afford \nto leave my parents alone to face their fate, to be sent, sooner or later, to a concentration camp, or \neven to a so-called extermination camp? Where did my responsibility lie? Should I foster my brain \nchild, logotherapy, by emigrating to fertile soil where I could write my books? Or should I \nconcentrate on my duties as a real child, the child of my parents who had to do whatever he could to \nprotect them? I pondered the problem this way and that but could not arrive at a solution; this was \nthe type of dilemma that made one wish for \"a hint from Heaven,\" as the phrase goes. \n \nIt was then that I noticed a piece of marble lying on a table at home. When I asked my father about \nit, he explained that he had found it on the site where the National Socialists had burned down the \nlargest Viennese synagogue. He had taken the piece home because it was a part of the tablets on \nwhich the Ten Commandments were inscribed. One gilded Hebrew letter was engraved on the \npiece; my father explained that this letter stood for one of the Commandments. Eagerly I asked, \n\"Which one is it?\" He answered, \"Honour thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long upon \nthe land.\" At that moment I decided to stay with my father and my mother upon the land, and to let \nthe American visa lapse. \n \nVIKTOR E.

    "raw_text": "PART ONE \n \nExperiences in a Concentration Camp \n \nTHIS BOOK DOES NOT CLAIM TO BE an account of facts and events but of personal experiences, \nexperiences which millions of prisoners have suffered time and again. It is the inside story of a \nconcentration camp, told by one of its survivors. This tale is not concerned with the great horrors, \nwhich have already been described often enough (though less often believed), but with the \nmultitude of small torments. In other words, it will try to answer this question: How was everyday \nlife in a concentration camp reflected in the mind of the average prisoner? \n \nMost of the events described here did not take place in the large and famous camps, but in the small \nones where most of the real extermination took place. This story is not about the suffering and \ndeath of great heroes and martyrs, nor is it about the prominent Capos—prisoners who acted as \ntrustees, having special privileges—or well-known prisoners. Thus it is not so much concerned with \nthe sufferings of the mighty, but with the sacrifices, the crucifixion and the deaths of the great army \nof unknown and unrecorded victims. It was these common prisoners, who bore no distinguishing \nmarks on their sleeves, whom the Capos really despised. While these ordinary prisoners had little or \nnothing to eat, the Capos were never hungry; in fact many of the Capos fared better in the camp \nthan they had in their entire lives. Often they were harder on the prisoners than were the guards, \nand beat them more cruelly than the SS men did. These Capos, of course, were chosen only from \nthose prisoners whose characters promised to make them suitable for such procedures, and if they \ndid not comply with what was expected of them, they were immediately demoted. They soon \nbecame much like the SS men and the camp wardens and may be judged on a similar psychological \nbasis. \n \nIt is easy for the outsider to get the wrong conception of camp life, a conception mingled with \nsentiment and pity. Little does he know of the hard fight for existence which raged among the \nprisoners. This was an unrelenting struggle for daily bread and for life itself, for one's own sake or for \nthat of a good friend. \n \nLet us take the case of a transport which was officially announced to transfer a certain number of \nprisoners to another camp; but it was a fairly safe guess that its final destination would be the gas \nchambers. A selection of sick or feeble prisoners incapable of work would be sent to one of the big \ncentral camps which were fitted with gas chambers and crematoriums. The selection process was \nthe signal for a free fight among all the prisoners, or of group against group. All that mattered was \nthat one's own name and that of one's friend were crossed off the list of victims, though everyone \nknew that for each man saved another victim had to be found. \n \nA definite number of prisoners had to go with each transport. It did not really matter which, since \neach of them was nothing but a number. On their admission to the camp (at least this was the \nmethod in Auschwitz) all their documents had been taken from them, together with their other \npossessions. Each prisoner, therefore, had had an opportunity to claim a fictitious name or \nprofession; and for various reasons many did this. The authorities were interested only in the \ncaptives' numbers. These numbers were often tattooed on their skin, and also had to be sewn to a \ncertain spot on the trousers, jacket, or coat. Any guard who wanted to make a charge against a \nprisoner just glanced at his number (and how we dreaded such glances!); he never asked for his \nname.\n\f\nTo return to the convoy about to depart. There was neither time nor desire to consider moral or \nethical issues. Every man was controlled by one thought only: to keep himself alive for the family \nwaiting for him at home, and to save his friends. With no hesitation, therefore, he would arrange for \nanother prisoner, another \"number,\" to take his place in the transport. \n \nAs I have already mentioned, the process of selecting Capos was a negative one; only the most \nbrutal of the prisoners were chosen for this job (although there were some happy exceptions). But \napart from the selection of Capos which was undertaken by the SS, there was a sort of self-selecting \nprocess going on the whole time among all of the prisoners. On the average, only those prisoners \ncould keep alive who, after years of trekking from camp to camp, had lost all scruples in their fight \nfor existence; they were prepared to use every means, honest and otherwise, even brutal force, \ntheft, and betrayal of their friends, in order to save themselves. We who have come back, by the aid \nof many lucky chances or miracles—whatever one may choose to call them—we know: the best of \nus did not return. \n \nMany factual accounts about concentration camps are already on record. Here, facts will be \nsignificant only as far as they are part of a man's experiences. It is the exact nature of these \nexperiences that the following essay will attempt to describe. For those who have been inmates in a \ncamp, it will attempt to explain their experiences in the light of present-day knowledge. And for \nthose who have never been inside, it may help them to comprehend, and above all to understand, \nthe experiences of that only too small percentage of prisoners who survived and who now find life \nvery difficult. These former prisoners often say, \"We dislike talking about our experiences. No \nexplanations are needed for those who have been inside, and the others will understand neither \nhow we felt then nor how we feel now.\" \n \nTo attempt a methodical presentation of the subject is very difficult, as psychology requires a certain \nscientific detachment. But does a man who makes his observations while he himself is a prisoner \npossess the necessary detachment? Such detachment is granted to the outsider, but he is too far \nremoved to make any statements of real value. Only the man inside knows. His judgments may not \nbe objective; his evaluations may be out of proportion. This is inevitable. An attempt must be made \nto avoid any personal bias, and that is the real difficulty of a book of this kind. At times it will be \nnecessary to have the courage to tell of very intimate experiences. I had intended to write this book \nanonymously, using my prison number only. But when the manuscript was completed, I saw that as \nan anonymous publication it would lose half its value, and that I must have the courage to state my \nconvictions openly. I therefore refrained from deleting any of the passages, in spite of an intense \ndislike of exhibitionism. \n \nI shall leave it to others to distil the contents of this book into dry theories. These might become a \ncontribution to the psychology of prison life, which was investigated after the First World War, and \nwhich acquainted us with the syndrome of \"barbed wire sickness.\" We are indebted to the Second \nWorld War for enriching our knowledge of the \"psychopathology of the masses,\" (if I may quote a \nvariation of the well-known phrase and title of a book by LeBon), for the war gave us the war of \nnerves and it gave us the concentration camp. \n \nAs this story is about my experiences as an ordinary prisoner, it is important that I mention, not \nwithout pride, that I was not employed as a psychiatrist in camp, or even as a doctor, except for the \nlast few weeks. A few of my colleagues were lucky enough to be employed in poorly heated first-aid \nposts applying bandages made of scraps of waste paper. But I was Number 119,104, and most of the \ntime I was digging and laying tracks for railway lines. At one time, my job was to dig a tunnel, \nwithout help, for a water main under a road. This feat did not go unrewarded; just before Christmas \n1944, I was presented with a gift of so-called \"premium coupons.\" These were issued by the\n\f\nconstruction firm to which we were practically sold as slaves: the firm paid the camp authorities a \nfixed price per day, per prisoner. The coupons cost the firm fifty pfennigs each and could be \nexchanged for six cigarettes, often weeks later, although they sometimes lost their validity. I became \nthe proud owner of a token worth twelve cigarettes. But more important, the cigarettes could be \nexchanged for twelve soups, and twelve soups were often a very real respite from starvation. \n \nThe privilege of actually smoking cigarettes was reserved for the Capo, who had his assured quota of \nweekly coupons; or possibly for a prisoner who worked as a foreman in a warehouse or workshop \nand received a few cigarettes in exchange for doing dangerous jobs. The only exceptions to this were \nthose who had lost the will to live and wanted to \"enjoy\" their last days. Thus, when we saw a \ncomrade smoking his own cigarettes, we knew he had given up faith in his strength to carry on, and, \nonce lost, the will to live seldom returned. \n \nWhen one examines the vast amount of material which has been amassed as the result of many \nprisoners' observations and experiences, three phases of the inmate's mental reactions to camp life \nbecome apparent: the period following his admission; the period when he is well entrenched in \ncamp routine; and the period following his release and liberation. \n \nThe symptom that characterizes the first phase is shock. Under certain conditions shock may even \nprecede the prisoner's formal admission to the camp. I shall give as an example the circumstances of \nmy own admission. \n \nFifteen hundred persons had been travelling by train for several days and nights: there were eighty \npeople in each coach. All had to lie on top of their luggage, the few remnants of their personal \npossessions. The carriages were so full that only the top parts of the windows were free to let in the \ngrey of dawn. Everyone expected the train to head for some munitions factory, in which we would \nbe employed as forced labour. We did not know whether we were still in Silesia or already in Poland. \nThe engine's whistle had an uncanny sound, like a cry for help sent out in commiseration for the \nunhappy load which it was destined to lead into perdition. Then the train shunted, obviously nearing \na main station. Suddenly a cry broke from the ranks of the anxious passengers, \"There is a sign, \nAuschwitz!\" Everyone's heart missed a beat at that moment. Auschwitz—the very name stood for all \nthat was horrible: gas chambers, crematoriums, massacres. Slowly, almost hesitatingly, the train \nmoved on as if it wanted to spare its passengers the dreadful realization as long as possible: \nAuschwitz! \n \nWith the progressive dawn, the outlines of an immense camp became visible: long stretches of \nseveral rows of barbed wire fences; watch towers; search lights; and long columns of ragged human \nfigures, grey in the greyness of dawn, trekking along the straight desolate roads, to what destination \nwe did not know. There were isolated shouts and whistles of command. We did not know their \nmeaning. My imagination led me to see gallows with people dangling on them. I was horrified, but \nthis was just as well, because step by step we had to become accustomed to a terrible and immense \nhorror. \n \nEventually we moved into the station. The initial silence was interrupted by shouted commands. We \nwere to hear those rough, shrill tones from then on, over and over again in all the camps. Their \nsound was almost like the last cry of a victim, and yet there was a difference. It had a rasping \nhoarseness, as if it came from the throat of a man who had to keep shouting like that, a man who \nwas being murdered again and again. The carriage doors were flung open and a small detachment of \nprisoners stormed inside. They wore striped uniforms, their heads were shaved, but they looked well \nfed. They spoke in every possible European tongue, and all with a certain amount of humour, which \nsounded grotesque under the circumstances. Like a drowning man clutching a straw, my inborn\n\f\noptimism (which has often controlled my feelings even in the most desperate situations) clung to \nthis thought: These prisoners look quite well, they seem to be in good spirits and even laugh. Who \nknows? I might manage to share their favourable position. \n \nIn psychiatry there is a certain condition known as \"delusion of reprieve.\" The condemned man, \nimmediately before his execution, gets the illusion that he might be reprieved at the very last \nminute. We, too, clung to shreds of hope and believed to the last moment that it would not be so \nbad. Just the sight of the red cheeks and round faces of those prisoners was a great encouragement. \nLittle did we know then that they formed a specially chosen elite, who for years had been the \nreceiving squad for new transports as they rolled into the station day after day. They took charge of \nthe new arrivals and their luggage, including scarce items and smuggled jewellery. Auschwitz must \nhave been a strange spot in this Europe of the last years of the war. There must have been unique \ntreasures of gold and silver, platinum and diamonds, not only in the huge storehouses but also in the \nhands of the SS. \n \nFifteen hundred captives were cooped up in a shed built to accommodate probably two hundred at \nthe most. We were cold and hungry and there was not enough room for everyone to squat on the \nbare ground, let alone to lie down. One five-ounce piece of bread was our only food in four days. Yet \nI heard the senior prisoners in charge of the shed bargain with one member of the receiving party \nabout a tie-pin made of platinum and diamonds. Most of the profits would eventually be traded for \nliquor—schnapps. I do not remember any more just how many thousands of marks were needed to \npurchase the quantity of schnapps required for a \"gay evening,\" but I do know that those long-term \nprisoners needed schnapps. Under such conditions, who could blame them for trying to dope \nthemselves? There was another group of prisoners who got liquor supplied in almost unlimited \nquantities by the SS: these were the men who were employed in the gas chambers and \ncrematoriums, and who knew very well that one day they would be relieved by a new shift of men, \nand that they would have to leave their enforced role of executioner and become victims \nthemselves. \n \nNearly everyone in our transport lived under the illusion that he would be reprieved, that everything \nwould yet be well. We did not realize the meaning behind the scene that was to follow presently. \nWe were told to leave our luggage in the train and to fall into two lines—women on one side, men \non the other—in order to file past a senior SS officer. Surprisingly enough, I had the courage to hide \nmy haversack under my coat. My line filed past the officer, man by man. I realized that it would be \ndangerous if the officer spotted my bag. He would at least knock me down; I knew that from \nprevious experience. Instinctively, I straightened on approaching the officer, so that he would not \nnotice my heavy load. Then I was face to face with him. He was a tall man who looked slim and fit in \nhis spotless uniform. What a contrast to us, who were untidy and grimy after our long journey! He \nhad assumed an attitude of careless ease, supporting his right elbow with his left hand. His right \nhand was lifted, and with the forefinger of that hand he pointed very leisurely to the right or to the \nleft. None of us had the slightest idea of the sinister meaning behind that little movement of a man's \nfinger, pointing now to the right and now to the left, but far more frequently to the left. \n \nIt was my turn. Somebody whispered to me that to be sent to the right side would mean work, the \nway to the left being for the sick and those incapable of work, who would be sent to a special camp. I \njust waited for things to take their course, the first of many such times to come. My haversack \nweighed me down a bit to the left, but I made an effort to walk upright. The SS man looked me over, \nappeared to hesitate, then put both his hands on my shoulders. I tried very hard to look smart, and \nhe turned my shoulders very slowly until I faced right, and I moved over to that side.\n\f\nThe significance of the finger game was explained to us in the evening. It was the first selection, the \nfirst verdict made on our existence or non-existence. For the great majority of our transport, about \n90 per cent, it meant death. Their sentence was carried out within the next few hours. Those who \nwere sent to the left were marched from the station straight to the crematorium. This building, as I \nwas told by someone who worked there, had the word \"bath\" written over its doors in several \nEuropean languages. On entering, each prisoner was handed a piece of soap, and then but mercifully \nI do not need to describe the events which followed. Many accounts have been written about this \nhorror. \n \nWe who were saved, the minority of our transport, found out the truth in the evening. I inquired \nfrom prisoners who had been there for some time where my colleague and friend P had been sent. \n\"Was he sent to the left side?\" \n\"Yes,\" I replied. \n\"Then you can see him there,\" I was told. \n\"Where?\" A hand pointed to the chimney a few hundred yards off, which was sending a column of \nflame up into the grey sky of Poland. It dissolved into a sinister cloud of smoke. \n\"That's where your friend is, floating up to Heaven,\" was the answer. But I still did not understand \nuntil the truth was explained to me in plain words. \n \nBut I am telling things out of their turn. From a psychological point of view, we had a long, long way \nin front of us from the break of that dawn at the station until our first night's rest at the camp. \n \nEscorted by SS guards with loaded guns, we were made to run from the station, past electrically \ncharged barbed wire, through the camp, to the cleansing station; for those of us who had passed the \nfirst selection, this was a real bath. Again our illusion of reprieve found confirmation. The SS men \nseemed almost charming. Soon we found out their reason. They were nice to us as long as they saw \nwatches on our wrists and could persuade us in well-meaning tones to hand them over. Would we \nnot have to hand over all our possessions anyway, and why should not that relatively nice person \nhave the watch? Maybe one day he would do one a good turn. \n \nWe waited in a shed which seemed to be the anteroom to the disinfecting chamber. SS men \nappeared and spread out blankets into which we had to throw all our possessions, all our watches \nand jewellery. There were still naive prisoners among us who asked, to the amusement of the more \nseasoned ones who were there as helpers, if they could not keep a wedding ring, a medal or a good-\nluck piece. No one could yet grasp the fact that everything would be taken away. \n \nI tried to take one of the old prisoners into my confidence. Approaching him furtively, I pointed to \nthe roll of paper in the inner pocket of my coat and said, \"Look, this is the manuscript of a scientific \nbook. I know what you will say; that I should be grateful to escape with my life, that that should be \nall I can expect of fate. But I cannot help myself. I must keep this manuscript at all costs; it contains \nmy life's work. Do you understand that?\" \n \nYes, he was beginning to understand. A grin spread slowly over his face, first piteous, then more \namused, mocking, insulting, until he bellowed one word at me in answer to my question, a word that \nwas ever present in the vocabulary of the camp inmates: \"Shit!\" At that moment I saw the plain \ntruth and did what marked the culminating point of the first phase of my psychological reaction: I \nstruck out my whole former life. \n \nSuddenly there was a stir among my fellow travellers, who had been standing about with pale, \nfrightened faces, helplessly debating. Again we heard the hoarsely shouted commands. We were \ndriven with blows into the immediate anteroom of the bath. There we assembled around an SS man\n\f\nwho waited until we had all arrived. Then he said, \"I will give you two minutes, and I shall time you \nby my watch. In these two minutes you will get fully undressed and drop everything on the floor \nwhere you are standing. You will take nothing with you except your shoes, your belt or suspenders, \nand possibly a truss. I am starting to count— now!\" \n \nWith unthinkable haste, people tore off their clothes. As the time grew shorter, they became \nincreasingly nervous and pulled clumsily at their underwear, belts and shoelaces. Then we heard the \nfirst sounds of whipping; leather straps beating down on naked bodies. \n \nNext we were herded into another room to be shaved: not only our heads were shorn, but not a hair \nwas left on our entire bodies. Then on to the showers, where we lined up again. We hardly \nrecognized each other; but with great relief some people noted that real water dripped from the \nsprays. \n \nWhile we were waiting for the shower, our nakedness was brought home to us: we really had \nnothing now except our bare bodies—even minus hair; all we possessed, literally, was our naked \nexistence. What else remained for us as a material link with our former lives? For me there were my \nglasses and my belt; the latter I had to exchange later on for a piece of bread. There was an extra bit \nof excitement in store for the owners of trusses. In the evening the senior prisoner in charge of our \nhut welcomed us with a speech in which he gave us his word of honour that he would hang, \npersonally, \"from that beam\"—he pointed to it—any person who had sewn money or precious \nstones into his truss. Proudly he explained that as a senior inhabitant the camp laws entitled him to \ndo so. \n \nWhere our shoes were concerned, matters were not so simple. Although we were supposed to keep \nthem, those who had fairly decent pairs had to give them up after all and were given in exchange \nshoes that did not fit. In for real trouble were those prisoners who had followed the apparently well-\nmeant advice (given in the anteroom) of the senior prisoners and had shortened their jackboots by \ncutting the tops off, then smearing soap on the cut edges to hide the sabotage. The SS men seemed \nto have waited for just that. All suspected of this crime had to go into a small adjoining room. After a \ntime we again heard the lashings of the strap, and the screams of tortured men. This time it lasted \nfor quite a while. \n \nThus the illusions some of us still held were destroyed one by one, and then, quite unexpectedly, \nmost of us were overcome by a grim sense of humour. We knew that we had nothing to lose except \nour so ridiculously naked lives. When the showers started to run, we all tried very hard to make fun, \nboth about ourselves and about each other. After all, real water did flow from the sprays! \n \nApart from that strange kind of humour, another sensation seized us: curiosity. I have experienced \nthis kind of curiosity before, as a fundamental reaction toward certain strange circumstances. When \nmy life was once endangered by a climbing accident, I felt only one sensation at the critical moment: \ncuriosity, curiosity as to whether I should come out of it alive or with a fractured skull or some other \ninjuries. \n \nCold curiosity predominated even in Auschwitz, somehow detaching the mind from its surroundings, \nwhich came to be regarded with a kind of objectivity. At that time one cultivated this state of mind \nas a means of protection. We were anxious to know what would happen next; and what would be \nthe consequence, for example, of our standing in the open air, in the chill of late autumn, stark \nnaked, and still wet from the showers. In the next few days our curiosity evolved into surprise; \nsurprise that we did not catch cold.\n\f\nThere were many similar surprises in store for new arrivals. The medical men among us learned first \nof all: \"Textbooks tell lies!\" Somewhere it is said that man cannot exist without sleep for more than a \nstated number of hours. Quite wrong! I had been convinced that there were certain things I just \ncould not do: I could not sleep without this or I could not live with that or the other. The first night in \nAuschwitz we slept in beds which were constructed in tiers. On each tier (measuring about six-and-a-\nhalf to eight feet) slept nine men, directly on the boards. Two blankets were shared by each nine \nmen. We could, of course, lie only on our sides, crowded and huddled against each other, which had \nsome advantages because of the bitter cold. Though it was forbidden to take shoes up to the bunks, \nsome people did use them secretly as pillows in spite of the fact that they were caked with mud. \nOtherwise one's head had to rest on the crook of an almost dislocated arm. And yet sleep came and \nbrought oblivion and relief from pain for a few hours. \n \nI would like to mention a few similar surprises on how much we could endure: we were unable to \nclean our teeth, and yet, in spite of that and a severe vitamin deficiency, we had healthier gums than \never before. We had to wear the same shirts for half a year, until they had lost all appearance of \nbeing shirts. For days we were unable to wash, even partially, because of frozen water-pipes, and yet \nthe sores and abrasions on hands which were dirty from work in the soil did not suppurate (that is, \nunless there was frostbite). Or for instance, a light sleeper, who used to be disturbed by the slightest \nnoise in the next room, now found himself lying pressed against a comrade who snored loudly a few \ninches from his ear and yet slept quite soundly through the noise. \n \nIf someone now asked of us the truth of Dostoevsky’s statement that flatly defines man as a being \nwho can get used to anything, we would reply, \"Yes, a man can get used to anything, but do not ask \nus how.\" But our psychological investigations have not taken us that far yet; neither had we \nprisoners reached that point. We were still in the first phase of our psychological reactions. \n \nThe thought of suicide was entertained by nearly everyone, if only for a brief time. It was born of the \nhopelessness of the situation, the constant danger of death looming over us daily and hourly, and \nthe closeness of the deaths suffered by many of the others. From personal convictions which will be \nmentioned later, I made myself a firm promise, on my first evening in camp, that I would not \"run \ninto the wire.\" This was a phrase used in camp to describe the most popular method of suicide—\ntouching the electrically charged barbed-wire fence. It was not entirely difficult for me to make this \ndecision. There was little point in committing suicide, since, for the average inmate, life expectation, \ncalculating objectively and counting all likely chances, was very poor. He could not with any \nassurance expect to be among the small percentage of men who survived all the selections. The \nprisoner of Auschwitz, in the first phase of shock, did not fear death. Even the gas chambers lost \ntheir horrors for him after the first few days—after all, they spared him the act of committing \nsuicide. \n \nFriends whom I have met later have told me that I was not one of those whom the shock of \nadmission greatly depressed. I only smiled, and quite sincerely, when the following episode occurred \nthe morning after our first night in Auschwitz. In spite of strict orders not to leave our \"blocks,\" a \ncolleague of mine, who had arrived in Auschwitz several weeks previously, smuggled himself into our \nhut. He wanted to calm and comfort us and tell us a few things. He had become so thin that at first \nwe did not recognize him. With a show of good humour and a Devil-may-care attitude he gave us a \nfew hurried tips: \"Don't be afraid! Don't fear the selections! Dr. M(the SS medical chief) has a soft \nspot for doctors.\" (This was wrong; my friend's kindly words were misleading. One prisoner, the \ndoctor of a block, of huts and a man of some sixty years, told me how he had entreated Dr. M to let \noff his son, who was destined for gas. Dr. M coldly refused.)\n\f\n\"But one thing I beg of you\"; he continued, \"shave daily, if at all possible, even if you have to use a \npiece of glass to do it ... even if you have to give your last piece of bread for it. You will look younger \nand the scraping will make your cheeks look ruddier. If you want to stay alive, there is only one way: \nlook fit for work. If you even limp, because, let us say, you have a small blister on your heel, and an \nSS man spots this, he will wave you aside and the next day you are sure to be gassed. Do you know \nwhat we mean by a 'Moslem'? A man who looks miserable, down and out, sick and emaciated, and \nwho cannot manage hard physical labour any longer . . . that is a 'Moslem.' Sooner or later, usually \nsooner, every 'Moslem' goes to the gas chambers. Therefore, remember: shave, stand and walk \nsmartly; then you need not be afraid of gas. All of you standing here, even if you have only been \nhere twenty-four hours, you need not fear gas, except perhaps you.\" And then he pointed to me and \nsaid, \"I hope you don't mind my telling you frankly.\" To the others he repeated, \" Of all of you he is \nthe only one who must fear the next selection. So, don't worry!\" And I smiled. I am now convinced \nthat anyone in my place on that day would have done the same. \n \nI think it was Lessing who once said, \"There are things which must cause you to lose your reason or \nyou have none to lose.\" An abnormal reaction to an abnormal situation is normal behaviour. Even \nwe psychiatrists expect the reactions of a man to an abnormal situation, such as being committed to \nan asylum, to be abnormal in proportion to the degree of his normality. The reaction of a man to his \nadmission to a concentration camp also represents an abnormal state of mind, but judged \nobjectively it is a normal and, as will be shown later, typical reaction to the given circumstances. \nThese reactions, as I have described them, began to change in a few days. The prisoner passed from \nthe first to the second phase; the phase of relative apathy, in which he achieved a kind of emotional \ndeath. \n \nApart from the already described reactions, the newly arrived prisoner experienced the tortures of \nother most painful emotions, all of which he tried to deaden. First of all, there was his boundless \nlonging for his home and his family. This often could become so acute that he felt himself consumed \nby longing. Then there was disgust; disgust with all the ugliness which surrounded him, even in its \nmere external forms. \n \nMost of the prisoners were given a uniform of rags which would have made a scarecrow elegant by \ncomparison. Between the huts in the camp lay pure filth, and the more one worked to clear it away, \nthe more one had to come in contact with it. It was a favourite practice to detail a new arrival to a \nwork group whose job was to clean the latrines and remove the sewage. If, as usually happened, \nsome of the excrement splashed into his face during its transport over bumpy fields, any sign of \ndisgust by the prisoner or any attempt to wipe off the filth would only be punished with a blow from \na Capo. And thus the mortification of normal reactions was hastened. \n \nAt first the prisoner looked away if he saw the punishment parades of another group; he could not \nbear to see fellow prisoners march up and down for hours in the mire, their movements directed by \nblows. Days or weeks later things changed. Early in the morning, when it was still dark, the prisoner \nstood in front of the gate with his detachment, ready to march. He heard a scream and saw how \n34 Man's Search for Meaning \n \na comrade was knocked down, pulled to his feet again, and knocked down once more—and why? He \nwas feverish but had reported to sick-bay at an improper time. He was being punished for this \nirregular attempt to be relieved of his duties. \n \nBut the prisoner who had passed into the second stage of his psychological reactions did not avert \nhis eyes any more. By then his feelings were blunted, and he watched unmoved. Another example: \nhe found himself waiting at sickbay, hoping to be granted two days of light work inside the camp\n\f\nbecause of injuries or perhaps oedema or fever. He stood unmoved while a twelve-year-old boy was \ncarried in who had been forced to stand at attention for hours in the snow or to work outside with \nbare feet because there were no shoes for him in the camp. His toes had become frostbitten, and \nthe doctor on duty picked off the black gangrenous stumps with tweezers, one by one. Disgust, \nhorror and pity are emotions that our spectator could not really feel any more. The sufferers, the \ndying and the dead, became such commonplace sights to him after a few weeks of camp life that \nthey could not move him any more. \n \nI spent some time in a hut for typhus patients who ran very high temperatures and were often \ndelirious, many of them moribund. After one of them had just died, I watched without any \nemotional upset the scene that followed, which was repeated over and over again with each death. \nOne by one the prisoners approached the still warm body. One grabbed the remains of a messy meal \nof potatoes; another decided that the corpse's wooden shoes were an improvement on his own, and \nexchanged them. A third man did the same with the dead man's coat, and another was glad to be \nable to secure some—just imagine!—genuine string. \n \nAll this I watched with unconcern. Eventually I asked the \"nurse\" to remove the body. When he \ndecided to do so, he took the corpse by its legs, allowing it to drop into the small corridor between \nthe two rows of boards which were the beds for the fifty typhus patients, and dragged it across the \nbumpy earthen floor toward the door. The two steps which led up into the open air always \nconstituted a problem for us, since we were exhausted from a chronic lack of food. After a few \nmonths' stay in the camp we could not walk up those steps, which were each about six inches high, \nwithout putting our hands on the door jambs to pull ourselves up. \n \nThe man with the corpse approached the steps. Wearily he dragged himself up. Then the body: first \nthe feet, then the trunk, and finally—with an uncanny rattling noise— the head of the corpse \nbumped up the two steps. \n \nMy place was on the opposite side of the hut, next to the small, sole window, which was built near \nthe floor. While my cold hands clasped a bowl of hot soup from which I sipped greedily, I happened \nto look out the window. The corpse which had just been removed stared in at me with glazed eyes. \nTwo hours before I had spoken to that man. Now I continued sipping my soup. \n \nIf my lack of emotion had not surprised me from the standpoint of professional interest, I would not \nremember this incident now, because there was so little feeling involved in it. \n \nApathy, the blunting of the emotions and the feeling that one could not care any more, were the \nsymptoms arising during the second stage of the prisoner's psychological reactions, and which \neventually made him insensitive to daily and hourly beatings. By means of this insensibility the \nprisoner soon surrounded himself with a very necessary protective shell. \n \nBeatings occurred on the slightest provocation, sometimes for no reason at all. For example, bread \nwas rationed out at our work site and we had to line up for it. Once, the man behind me stood off a \nlittle to one side and that lack of symmetry displeased the SS guard. I did not know what was going \non in the line behind me, nor in the mind of the SS guard, but suddenly I received two sharp blows \non my head. Only then did I spot the guard at my side who was using his stick. At such a moment it is \nnot the physical pain which hurts the most (and this applies to adults as much as to punished \nchildren); it is the mental agony caused by the injustice, the unreasonableness of it all. \n \nStrangely enough, a blow which does not even find its mark can, under certain circumstances, hurt \nmore than one that finds its mark. Once I was standing on a railway track in a snowstorm. In spite of\n\f\nthe weather our party had to keep on working. I worked quite hard at mending the track with gravel, \nsince that was the only way to keep warm. For only one moment I paused to get my breath and to \nlean on my shovel. Unfortunately the guard turned around just then and thought I was loafing. The \npain he caused me was not from any insults or any blows. That guard did not think it worth his while \nto say anything, not even a swear word, to the ragged, emaciated figure standing before him, which \nprobably reminded him only vaguely of a human form. Instead, he playfully picked up a stone and \nthrew it at me. That, to me, seemed the way to attract the attention of a beast, to call a domestic \nanimal back to its job, a creature with which you have so little in common that you do not even \npunish it. \n \nThe most painful part of beatings is the insult which they imply. At one time we had to carry some \nlong, heavy girders over icy tracks. If one man slipped, he endangered not only himself but all the \nothers who carried the same girder. An old friend of mine had a congenitally dislocated hip. He was \nglad to be capable of working in spite of it, since the physically disabled were almost certainly sent to \ndeath when a selection took place. He limped over the track with an especially heavy girder, and \nseemed about to fall and drag the others with him. As yet, I was not carrying a girder so I jumped to \nhis assistance without stopping to think. I was immediately hit on the back, rudely reprimanded and \nordered to return to my place. A few minutes previously the same guard who struck me had told us \ndeprecatingly that we \"pigs\" lacked the spirit of comradeship. \n \nAnother time, in a forest, with the temperature at 2°F, we began to dig up the topsoil, which was \nfrozen hard, in order to lay water pipes. By then I had grown rather weak physically. Along came a \nforeman with chubby rosy cheeks. His face definitely reminded me of a pig's head. I noticed that he \nwore lovely warm gloves in that bitter cold. For a time he watched me silently. I felt that trouble was \nbrewing, for in front of me lay the mound of earth which showed exactly how much I had dug. \n \nThen he began: \"You pig, I have been watching you the whole time! I'll teach you to work, yet! Wait \ntill you dig dirt with your teeth—you'll die like an animal! In two days I'll finish you off! You've never \ndone a stroke of work in your life. What were you, swine? A businessman?\" \n \nI was past caring. But I had to take his threat of killing me seriously, so I straightened up and looked \nhim directly in the eye. \"I was a doctor—a specialist.\" \n\"What? A doctor? I bet you got a lot of money out of people.\" \n\"As it happens, I did most of my work for no money at all, in clinics for the poor.\" But, now, I had said \ntoo much. He threw himself on me and knocked me down, shouting like a madman. I can no longer \nremember what he shouted. \n \nI want to show with this apparently trivial story that there are moments when indignation can rouse \neven a seemingly hardened prisoner—indignation not about cruelty or pain, but about the insult \nconnected with it. That time blood rushed to my head because I had to listen to a man judge my life \nwho had so little idea of it, a man (I must confess: the following remark, which I made to my fellow-\nprisoners after the scene, afforded me childish relief) \"who looked so vulgar and brutal that the \nnurse in the out-patient ward in my hospital would not even have admitted him to the waiting \nroom.\" \n \nFortunately the Capo in my working party was obligated to me; he had taken a liking to me because I \nlistened to his love stories and matrimonial troubles, which he poured out during the long marches \nto our work site. I had made an impression on him with my diagnosis of his character and with my \npsychotherapeutic advice. After that he was grateful, and this had already been of value to me. On \nseveral previous occasions he had reserved a place for me next to him in one of the first five rows of \nour detachment, which usually consisted of two hundred and eighty men. That favour was\n\f\nimportant. We had to line up early in the morning while it was still dark. Everybody was afraid of \nbeing late and of having to stand in the back rows. If men were required for an unpleasant and \ndisliked job, the senior Capo appeared and usually collected the men he needed from the back rows. \nThese men had to march away to another, especially dreaded kind of work under the command of \nstrange guards. Occasionally the senior Capo chose men from the first five rows, just to catch those \nwho tried to be clever. All protests and entreaties were silenced by a few well-aimed kicks, and the \nchosen victims were chased to the meeting place with shouts and blows. \n \nHowever, as long as my Capo felt the need of pouring out his heart, this could not happen to me. I \nhad a guaranteed place of honour next to him. But there was another advantage, too. Like nearly all \nthe camp inmates I was suffering from oedema. My legs were so swollen and the skin on them so \ntightly stretched that I could scarcely bend my knees. I had to leave my shoes unlaced in order to \nmake them fit my swollen feet. There would not have been space for socks even if I had had any. So \nmy partly bare feet were always wet and my shoes always full of snow. This, of course, caused \nfrostbite and chilblains. Every single step became real torture. Clumps of ice formed on our shoes \nduring our marches over snow-covered fields. Over and again men slipped and those following \nbehind stumbled on top of them. Then the column would stop for a moment, but not for long. One \nof the guards soon took action and worked over the men with the butt of his rifle to make them get \nup quickly. The more to the front of the column you were, the less often you were disturbed by \nhaving to stop and then to make up for lost time by running on your painful feet. I was very happy to \nbe the personally appointed physician to His Honour the Capo, and to march in the first row at an \neven pace. \n \nAs an additional payment for my services, I could be sure that as long as soup was being dealt out at \nlunchtime at our work site, he would, when my turn came, dip the ladle right to the bottom of the \nvat and fish out a few peas. This Capo, a former army officer, even had the courage to whisper to the \nforeman, whom I had quarrelled with, that he knew me to be an unusually good worker. That didn't \nhelp matters, but he nevertheless managed to save my life (one of the many times it was to be \nsaved). The day after the episode with the foreman he smuggled me into another work party. \n \nThere were foremen who felt sorry for us and who did their best to ease our situation, at least at the \nbuilding site. But even they kept on reminding us that an ordinary labourer did several times as \nmuch work as we did, and in a shorter time. But they did see reason if they were told that a normal \nworkman did not live on 10-1/2 ounces of bread (theoretically—actually we often had less) and 1-\n3/4 pints of thin soup per day; that a normal labourer did not live under the mental stress we had to \nsubmit to, not having news of our families, who had either been sent to another camp or gassed \nright away; that a normal workman was not threatened by death continuously, daily and hourly. I \neven allowed myself to say once to a kindly foreman, \"If you could learn from me how to do a brain \noperation in as short a time as I am learning this road work from you, I would have great respect for \nyou.\" And he grinned. \n \nI shall never forget how I was roused one night by the groans of a fellow prisoner, who threw himself \nabout in his sleep, obviously having a horrible nightmare. Since I had always been especially sorry for \npeople who suffered from fearful dreams or deliria, I wanted to wake the poor man. Suddenly I drew \nback the hand which was ready to shake him, frightened at the thing I was about to do. At that \nmoment I became intensely conscious of the fact that no dream, no matter how horrible, could be as \nbad as the reality of the camp which surrounded us, and to which I was about to recall him. \nApathy, the main symptom of the second phase, was a necessary mechanism of self-defence. Reality \ndimmed, and all efforts and all emotions were cantered on one task: preserving one's own life and \nthat of the other fellow. It was typical to hear the prisoners, while they were being herded back to \ncamp from their work sites in the evening, sigh with relief and say, \"Well, another day is over.\"\n\f\nIt can be readily understood that such a state of strain, coupled with the constant necessity of \nconcentrating on the task of staying alive, forced the prisoner's inner life down to a primitive level. \nSeveral of my colleagues in camp who were trained in psychoanalysis often spoke of a \"regression\" \nin the camp inmate—a retreat to a more primitive form of mental life. His wishes and desires \nbecame obvious in his dreams. \n \nWhat did the prisoner dream about most frequently? Of bread, cake, cigarettes, and nice warm \nbaths. The lack of having these simple desires satisfied led him to seek wish-fulfilment in dreams. \n \nWhether these dreams did any good is another matter; the dreamer had to wake from them to the \nreality of camp life, and to the terrible contrast between that and his dream illusions. \n \nBecause of the high degree of undernourishment which the prisoners suffered, it was natural that \nthe desire for food was the major primitive instinct around which mental life cantered. Let us \nobserve the majority of prisoners when they happened to work near each other and were, for once, \nnot closely watched. They would immediately start discussing food. One fellow would ask another \nworking next to him in the ditch what his favourite dishes were. Then they would exchange recipes \nand plan the menu for the day when they would have a reunion—the day in a distant future when \nthey would be liberated and returned home. They would go on and on, picturing it all in detail, until \nsuddenly a warning was passed down the trench, usually in the form of a special password or \nnumber: \"The guard is coming.\" \n \nI always regarded the discussions about food as dangerous. Is it not wrong to provoke the organism \nwith such detailed and affective pictures of delicacies when it has somehow managed to adapt itself \nto extremely small rations and low calories? Though it may afford momentary psychological relief, it \nis an illusion which physiologically, surely, must not be without danger. \n \nDuring the later part of our imprisonment, the daily ration consisted of very watery soup given out \nonce daily, and the usual small bread ration. In addition to that, there was the so-called \"extra \nallowance,\" consisting of three-fourths of an ounce of margarine, or of a slice of poor quality \nsausage, or of a little piece of cheese, or a bit of synthetic honey, or a spoonful of watery jam, \nvarying daily. In calories, this diet was absolutely inadequate, especially taking into consideration our \nheavy manual work and our constant exposure to the cold in inadequate clothing. The sick who were \n\"under special care\"—that is, those who were allowed to lie in the huts instead of leaving the camp \nfor work—-were even worse off. \n \nWhen the last layers of subcutaneous fat had vanished, and we looked like skeletons disguised with \nskin and rags, we could watch our bodies beginning to devour themselves. The organism digested its \nown protein, and the muscles disappeared. Then the body had no powers of resistance left. One \nafter another the members of the little community in our hut died. Each of us could calculate with \nfair accuracy whose turn would be next, and when his own would come. After many observations we \nknew the symptoms well, which made the correctness of our prognoses quite certain. \"He won't last \nlong,\" or, \"This is the next one,\" we whispered to each other, and when, during our daily search for \nlice, we saw our own naked bodies in the evening, we thought alike: This body here, my body, is \nreally a corpse already. What has become of me? I am but a small portion of a great mass of human \nflesh ... of a mass behind barbed wire, crowded into a few earthen huts; a mass of which daily a \ncertain portion begins to rot because it has become lifeless. \n \nI mentioned above how unavoidable were the thoughts about food and favourite dishes which \nforced themselves into the consciousness of the prisoner, whenever he had a moment to spare. \nPerhaps it can be understood, then, that even the strongest of us was longing for the time when he\n\f\nwould have fairly good food again, not for the sake of good food itself, but for the sake of knowing \nthat the sub-human existence, which had made us unable to think of anything other than food, \nwould at last cease. \n \nThose who have not gone through a similar experience can hardly conceive of the soul-destroying \nmental conflict and clashes of will power which a famished man experiences. They can hardly grasp \nwhat it means to stand digging in a trench, listening only for the siren to announce 9:30 or 10:00 \nA.M.—the half-hour lunch interval—when bread would be rationed out (as long as it was still \navailable); repeatedly asking the foreman—if he wasn't a disagreeable fellow—what the time was; \nand tenderly touching a piece of bread in one's coat pocket, first stroking it with frozen gloveless \nfingers, then breaking off a crumb and putting it in one's mouth and finally, with the last bit of will \npower, pocketing it again, having promised oneself that morning to hold out till afternoon. \n \nWe could hold endless debates on the sense or nonsense of certain methods of dealing with the \nsmall bread ration, which was given out only once daily during the latter part of our confinement. \nThere were two schools of thought. One was in favour of eating up the ration immediately. This had \nthe twofold advantage of satisfying the worst hunger pangs for a very short time at least once a day \nand of safeguarding against possible theft or loss of the ration. The second group, which held with \ndividing the ration up, used different arguments. I finally joined their ranks. \n \nThe most ghastly moment of the twenty-four hours of camp life was the awakening, when, at a still \nnocturnal hour, the three shrill blows of a whistle tore us pitilessly from our exhausted sleep and \nfrom the longings in our dreams. We then began the tussle with our wet shoes, into which we could \nscarcely force our feet, which were sore and swollen with oedema. And there were the usual moans \nand groans about petty troubles, such as the snapping of wires which replaced shoelaces. One \nmorning I heard someone, whom I knew to be brave and dignified, cry like a child because he finally \nhad to go to the snowy marching grounds in his bare feet, as his shoes were too shrunken for him to \nwear. In those ghastly minutes, I found a little bit of comfort; a small piece of bread which I drew out \nof my pocket and munched with absorbed delight. \n \nUndernourishment, besides being the cause of the general preoccupation with food, probably also \nexplains the fact that the sexual urge was generally absent. Apart from the initial effects of shock, \nthis appears to be the only explanation of a phenomenon which a psychologist was bound to \nobserve in those all-male camps: that, as opposed to all other strictly male establishments—such as \narmy barracks—there was little sexual perversion. Even in his dreams the prisoner did not seem to \nconcern himself with sex, although his frustrated emotions and his finer, higher feelings did find \ndefinite expression in them. \n \nWith the majority of the prisoners, the primitive life and the effort of having to concentrate on just \nsaving one's skin led to a total disregard of anything not serving that purpose, and explained the \nprisoners' complete lack of sentiment. This was brought home to me on my transfer from Auschwitz \nto a camp affiliated with Dachau. The train which carried us—about 2,000 prisoners—passed \nthrough Vienna. At about midnight we passed one of the Viennese railway stations. The track was \ngoing to lead us past the street where I was born, past the house where I had lived many years of my \nlife, in fact, until I was taken prisoner. \n \nThere were fifty of us in the prison car, which had two small, barred peepholes. There was only \nenough room for one group to squat on the floor, while the others, who had to stand up for hours, \ncrowded round the peepholes. Standing on tiptoe and looking past the others' heads through the \nbars of the window, I caught an eerie glimpse of my native town. We all felt more dead than alive, \nsince we thought that our transport was heading for the camp at Mauthausen and that we had only\n\f\none or two weeks to live. I had a distinct feeling that I saw the streets, the squares and the houses of \nmy childhood with the eyes of a dead man who had come back from another world and was looking \ndown on a ghostly city. \n \nAfter hours of delay the train left the station. And there was the street—my street! The young lads \nwho had a number of years of camp life behind them and for whom such a journey was a great \nevent stared attentively through the peephole. I began to beg them, to entreat them, to let me \nstand in front for one moment only. I tried to explain how much a look through that window meant \nto me just then. My request was refused with rudeness and cynicism: \"You lived here all those \nyears? Well, then you have seen quite enough already!\" \n \nIn general there was also a \"cultural hibernation\" in the camp. There were two exceptions to this: \npolitics and religion. Politics were talked about everywhere in camp, almost continuously; the \ndiscussions were based chiefly on rumours, which were snapped up and passed around avidly. The \nrumours about the military situation were usually contradictory. They followed one another rapidly \nand succeeded only in making a contribution to the war of nerves that was waged in the minds of all \nthe prisoners. Many times, hopes for a speedy end to the war, which had been fanned by optimistic \nrumours, were disappointed. Some men lost all hope, but it was the incorrigible optimists who were \nthe most irritating companions. \n \nThe religious interest of the prisoners, as far and as soon as it developed, was the most sincere \nimaginable. The depth and vigour of religious belief often surprised and moved a new arrival. Most \nimpressive in this connection were improvised prayers or services in the corner of a hut, or in the \ndarkness of the locked cattle truck in which we were brought back from a distant work site, tired, \nhungry and frozen in our ragged clothing. \n \nIn the winter and spring of 1945 there was an outbreak of typhus which infected nearly all the \nprisoners. The mortality was great among the weak, who had to keep on with their hard work as \nlong as they possibly could. The quarters for the sick were most inadequate, there were practically \nno medicines or attendants. Some of the symptoms of the disease were extremely disagreeable: an \nirrepressible aversion to even a scrap of food (which was an additional danger to life) and terrible \nattacks of delirium. The worst case of delirium was suffered by a friend of mine who thought that he \nwas dying and wanted to pray. In his delirium he could not find the words to do so. To avoid these \nattacks of delirium, I tried, as did many of the others, to keep awake for most of the night. For hours \nI composed speeches in my mind. Eventually I began to reconstruct the manuscript which I had lost \nin the disinfection chamber of Auschwitz, and scribbled the key words in shorthand on tiny scraps of \npaper. \n \nOccasionally a scientific debate developed in camp. Once I witnessed something I had never seen, \neven in my normal life, although it lay somewhat near my own professional interests: a spiritualistic \nséance. I had been invited to attend by the camp's chief doctor (also a prisoner), who knew that I \nwas a specialist in psychiatry. The meeting took place in his small, private room in the sick quarters. \nA small circle had gathered, among them, quite illegally, the warrant officer from the sanitation \nsquad. \n \nOne man began to invoke the spirits with a kind of prayer. The camp's clerk sat in front of a blank \nsheet of paper, without any conscious intention of writing. During the next ten minutes (after which \ntime the séance was terminated because of the medium's failure to conjure the spirits to appear) his \npencil slowly drew lines across the paper, forming quite legibly \"VAE V.\" It was asserted that the clerk \nhad never learned Latin and that he had never before heard the words \"vae victis\"—woe to the \nvanquished. In my opinion he must have heard them once in his life, without recollecting them, and\n\f\nthey must have been available to the \"spirit\" (the spirit of his subconscious mind) at that time, a few \nmonths before our liberation and the end of the war. \n \nIn spite of all the enforced physical and mental primitiveness of the life in a concentration camp, it \nwas possible for spiritual life to deepen. Sensitive people who were used to a rich intellectual life \nmay have suffered much pain (they were often of a delicate constitution), but the damage to their \ninner selves was less. They were able to retreat from their terrible surroundings to a life of inner \nriches and spiritual freedom. Only in this way can one explain the apparent paradox that some \nprisoners of a less hardy makeup often seemed to survive camp life better than did those of a robust \nnature. In order to make myself clear, I am forced to fall back on personal experience. Let me tell \nwhat happened on those early mornings when we had to march to our work site. \n \nThere were shouted commands: \"Detachment, forward march! Left-2-3-4! Left-2-3-4! Left-2-3-4! \nLeft-2-3-4! First man about, left and left and left and left! Caps off!\" These words sound in my ears \neven now. At the order \"Caps off!\" we passed the gate of the camp, and searchlights were trained \nupon us. Whoever did not march smartly got a kick. And worse off was the man who, because of the \ncold, had pulled his cap back over his ears before permission was given. \n \nWe stumbled on in the darkness, over big stones and through large puddles, along the one road \nleading from the camp. The accompanying guards kept shouting at us and driving us with the butts \nof their rifles. Anyone with very sore feet supported himself on his neighbour’s arm. Hardly a word \nwas spoken; the icy wind did not encourage talk. Hiding his mouth behind his upturned collar, the \nman marching next to me whispered suddenly: \"If our wives could see us now! I do hope they are \nbetter off in their camps and don't know what is happening to us.\" \n \nThat brought thoughts of my own wife to mind. And as we stumbled on for miles, slipping on icy \nspots, supporting each other time and again, dragging one another up and onward, nothing was \nsaid, but we both knew: each of us was thinking of his wife. Occasionally I looked at the sky, where \nthe stars were fading and the pink light of the morning was beginning to spread behind a dark bank \nof clouds. But my mind clung to my wife's image, imagining it with an uncanny acuteness. I heard her \nanswering me, saw her smile, her frank and encouraging look. Real or not, her look was then more \nluminous than the sun which was beginning to rise. \n \nA thought transfixed me: for the first time in my life I saw the truth as it is set into song by so many \npoets, proclaimed as the final wisdom by so many thinkers. The truth —that love is the ultimate and \nthe highest goal to which man can aspire. Then I grasped the meaning of the greatest secret that \nhuman poetry and human thought and belief have to impart: The salvation of man is through love \nand in love. I understood how a man who has nothing left in this world still may know bliss, be it only \nfor a brief moment, in the contemplation of his beloved. In a position of utter desolation, when man \ncannot express himself in positive action, when his only achievement may consist in enduring his \nsufferings in the right way—an honourable way— in such a position man can, through loving \ncontemplation of the image he carries of his beloved, achieve fulfilment. For the first time in my life I \nwas able to understand the meaning of the words, \"The angels are lost in perpetual contemplation \nof an infinite glory.\" \n \nIn front of me a man stumbled and those following him fell on top of him. The guard rushed over \nand used his whip on them all. Thus my thoughts were interrupted for a few minutes. But soon my \nsoul found its way back from the prisoner's existence to another world, and I resumed talk with my \nloved one: I asked her questions, and she answered; she questioned me in return, and I answered.\n\f\n\"Stop!\" We had arrived at our work site. Everybody rushed into the dark hut in the hope of getting a \nfairly decent tool. Each prisoner got a spade or a pickaxe. \n \n\"Can't you hurry up, you pigs?\" Soon we had resumed the previous day's positions in the ditch. The \nfrozen ground cracked under the point of the pickaxes, and sparks flew. The men were silent, their \nbrains numb. \n \nMy mind still clung to the image of my wife. A thought crossed my mind: I didn't even know if she \nwere still alive. I knew only one thing—which I have learned well by now: Love goes very far beyond \nthe physical person of the beloved. It finds its deepest meaning in his spiritual being, his inner self. \nWhether or not he is actually present, whether or not he is still alive at all, ceases somehow to be of \nimportance. \n \nI did not know whether my wife was alive, and I had no means of finding out (during all my prison \nlife there was no outgoing or incoming mail); but at that moment it ceased to matter. There was no \nneed for me to know; nothing could touch the strength of my love, my thoughts, and the image of \nmy beloved. Had I known then that my wife was dead, I think that I would still have given myself, \nundisturbed by that knowledge, to the contemplation of her image, and that my mental \nconversation with her would have been just as vivid and just as satisfying. \"Set me like a seal upon \nthy heart, love is as strong as death.\" \n \nThis intensification of inner life helped the prisoner find a refuge from the emptiness, desolation and \nspiritual poverty of his existence, by letting him escape into the past. When given free rein, his \nimagination played with past events, often not important ones, but minor happenings and trifling \nthings. His nostalgic memory glorified them and they assumed a strange character. Their world and \ntheir existence seemed very distant and the spirit reached out for them longingly: In my mind I took \nbus rides, unlocked the front door of my apartment, answered my telephone, switched on the \nelectric lights. Our thoughts often cantered on such details, and these memories could move one to \ntears. \n \nAs the inner life of the prisoner tended to become more intense, he also experienced the beauty of \nart and nature as never before. Under their influence he sometimes even forgot his own frightful \ncircumstances. If someone had seen our faces on the journey from Auschwitz to a Bavarian camp as \nwe beheld the mountains of Salzburg with their summits glowing in the sunset, through the little \nbarred windows of the prison carriage, he would never have believed that those were the faces of \nmen who had given up all hope of life and liberty. Despite that factor—or maybe because of it—we \nwere carried away by nature's beauty, which we had missed for so long. \n \nIn camp, too, a man might draw the attention of a comrade working next to him to a nice view of the \nsetting sun shining through the tall trees of the Bavarian woods (as in the famous water colour by \nDiirer), the same woods in which we had built an enormous, hidden munitions plant. One evening, \nwhen we were already resting on the floor of our hut, dead tired, soup bowls in hand, a fellow \nprisoner rushed in and asked us to run out to the assembly grounds and see the wonderful sunset. \nStanding outside we saw sinister clouds glowing in the west and the whole sky alive with clouds of \never-changing shapes and colours, from steel blue to blood red. The desolate grey mud huts \nprovided a sharp contrast, while the puddles on the muddy ground reflected the glowing sky. Then, \nafter minutes of moving silence, one prisoner said to another, \"How beautiful the world could be!\" \n \nAnother time we were at work in a trench. The dawn was grey around us; grey was the sky above; \ngrey the snow in the pale light of dawn; grey the rags in which my fellow prisoners were clad, and \ngrey their faces. I was again conversing silently with my wife, or perhaps I was struggling to find the\n\f\nreason for my sufferings, my slow dying. In a last violent protest against the hopelessness of \nimminent death, I sensed my spirit piercing through the enveloping gloom. I felt it transcend that \nhopeless, meaningless world, and from somewhere I heard a victorious \"Yes\" in answer to my \nquestion of the existence of an ultimate purpose. At that moment a light was lit in a distant \nfarmhouse, which stood on the horizon as if painted there, in the midst of the miserable grey of a \ndawning morning in Bavaria. \"Et lux in tenebris lucet\"—and the light shineth in the darkness. For \nhours I stood hacking at the icy ground. The guard passed by, insulting me, and once again 1 \ncommuned with my beloved. More and more I felt that she was present, that she was with me; I had \nthe feeling that I was able to touch her, able to stretch out my hand and grasp hers. The feeling was \nvery strong: she was there. Then, at that very moment, a bird flew down silently and perched just in \nfront of me, on the heap of soil which I had dug up from the ditch, and looked steadily at me. \n \nEarlier, I mentioned art. Is there such a thing in a concentration camp? It rather depends on what \none chooses to call art. A kind of cabaret was improvised from time to time. A hut was cleared \ntemporarily, a few wooden benches were pushed or nailed together and a program was drawn up. \nIn the evening those who had fairly good positions in camp—the Capos and the workers who did not \nhave to leave camp on distant marches—assembled there. They came to have a few laughs or \nperhaps to cry a little; anyway, to forget. There were songs, poems, jokes, some with underlying \nsatire regarding the camp. All were meant to help us forget, and they did help. The gatherings were \nso effective that a few ordinary prisoners went to see the cabaret in spite of their fatigue even \nthough they missed their daily portion of food by going. \n \nDuring the half-hour lunch interval when soup (which the contractors paid for and for which they did \nnot spend much) was ladled out at our work site, we were allowed to assemble in an unfinished \nengine room. On entering, everyone got a ladleful of the watery soup. While we sipped it greedily, a \nprisoner climbed onto a tub and sang Italian arias. We enjoyed the songs, and he was guaranteed a \ndouble helping of soup, straight \"from the bottom\"—that meant with peas! \n \nRewards were given in camp not only for entertainment, but also for applause. I, for example, could \nhave found protection (how lucky I was never in need of it!) from the camp's most dreaded Capo, \nwho for more than one good reason was known as \"The Murderous Capo.\" This is how it happened. \nOne evening I had the great honour of being invited again to the room where the spiritualistic \nséance had taken place. There were gathered the same intimate friends of the chief doctor and, \nmost illegally, the warrant officer from the sanitation squad was again present. The Murderous Capo \nentered the room by chance, and he was asked to recite one of his poems, which had become \nfamous (or infamous) in camp. He did not need to be asked twice and quickly produced a kind of \ndiary from which he began to read samples of his art. I bit my lips till they hurt in order to keep from \nlaughing at one of his love poems, and very likely that saved my life. Since I was also generous with \nmy applause, my life might have been saved even had I been detailed to his working party to which I \nhad previously been assigned for one day—a day that was quite enough for me. It was useful, \nanyway, to be known to The Murderous Capo from a favourable angle. So I applauded as hard as I \ncould. \n \nGenerally speaking, of course, any pursuit of art in camp was somewhat grotesque. I would say that \nthe real impression made by anything connected with art arose only from the ghostlike contrast \nbetween the performance and the background of desolate camp life. I shall never forget how I \nawoke from the deep sleep of exhaustion on my second night in Auschwitz—roused by music. The \nsenior warden of the hut had some kind of celebration in his room, which was near the entrance of \nthe hut. Tipsy voices bawled some hackneyed tunes. Suddenly there was a silence and into the night \na violin sang a desperately sad tango, an unusual tune not spoiled by frequent playing. The violin \nwept and a part of me wept with it, for on that same day someone had a twenty-fourth birthday.\n\f\nThat someone lay in another part of the Auschwitz camp, possibly only a few hundred or a thousand \nyards away, and yet completely out of reach. That someone was my wife. \n \nTo discover that there was any semblance of art in a concentration camp must be surprise enough \nfor an outsider, but he may be even more astonished to hear that one could find a sense of humour \nthere as well; of course, only the faint trace of one, and then only for a few seconds or minutes. \nHumour was another of the soul's weapons in the fight for self-preservation. It is well known that \nhumour, more than anything else in the human make-up, can afford an aloofness and an ability to \nrise above any situation, even if only for a few seconds. I practically trained a friend of mine who \nworked next to me on the building site to develop a sense of humour. I suggested to him that we \nwould promise each other to invent at least one amusing story daily, about some incident that could \nhappen one day after our liberation. He was a surgeon and had been an assistant on the staff of a \nlarge hospital. So I once tried to get him to smile by describing to him how he would be unable to \nlose the habits of camp life when he returned to his former work. On the building site (especially \nwhen the supervisor made his tour of inspection) the foreman encouraged us to work faster by \nshouting: \"Action! Action!\" I told my friend, \"One day you will be back in the operating room, \nperforming a big abdominal operation. Suddenly an orderly will rush in announcing the arrival of the \nsenior surgeon by shouting, 'Action! Action!' \" \n \nSometimes the other men invented amusing dreams about the future, such as forecasting that \nduring a future dinner engagement they might forget themselves when the soup was served and beg \nthe hostess to ladle it \"from the bottom.\" \n \nThe attempt to develop a sense of humour and to see things in a humorous light is some kind of a \ntrick learned while mastering the art of living. Yet it is possible to practice the art of living even in a \nconcentration camp, although suffering is omnipresent. To draw an analogy: a man's suffering is \nsimilar to the behaviour of gas. If a certain quantity of gas is pumped into an empty chamber, it will \nfill the chamber completely and evenly, no matter how big the chamber. Thus suffering completely \nfills the human soul and conscious mind, no matter whether the suffering is great or little. Therefore \nthe \"size\" of human suffering is absolutely relative. \n \nIt also follows that a very trifling thing can cause the greatest of joys. Take as an example something \nthat happened on our journey from Auschwitz to the camp affiliated with Dachau. We had all been \nafraid that our transport was heading for the Mauthausen camp. We became more and more tense \nas we approached a certain bridge over the Danube which the train would have to cross to reach \nMauthausen, according to the statement of experienced travelling companions. Those who have \nnever seen anything similar cannot possibly imagine the dance of joy performed in the carriage by \nthe prisoners when they saw that our transport was not crossing the bridge and was instead heading \n\"only\" for Dachau. \n \nAnd again, what happened on our arrival in that camp, after a journey lasting two days and three \nnights? There had not been enough room for everybody to crouch on the floor of the carriage at the \nsame time. The majority of us had to stand all the way, while a few took turns at squatting on the \nscanty straw which was soaked with human urine. When we arrived the first important news that we \nheard from older prisoners was that this comparatively small camp (its population was 2,500) had no \n\"oven,\" no crematorium, no gas! That meant that a person who had become a \"Moslem\" could not \nbe taken straight to the gas chamber, but would have to wait until a so-called \"sick convoy\" had \nbeen arranged to return to Auschwitz. This joyful surprise put us all in a good mood. The wish of the \nsenior warden of our hut in Auschwitz had come true: we had come, as quickly as possible, to a \ncamp which did not have a \"chimney\"—unlike Auschwitz. We laughed and cracked jokes in spite of, \nand during, all we had to go through in the next few hours.\n\f\nWhen we new arrivals were counted, one of us was missing. So we had to wait outside in the rain \nand cold wind until the missing man was found. He was at last discovered in a hut, where he had \nfallen asleep from exhaustion. Then the roll call was turned into a punishment parade. All through \nthe night and late into the next morning, we had to stand outside, frozen and soaked to the skin \nafter the strain of our long journey. And yet we were all very pleased! There was no chimney in this \ncamp and Auschwitz was a long way off. \n \nAnother time we saw a group of convicts pass our work site. How obvious the relativity of all \nsuffering appeared to us then! We envied those prisoners their relatively well-regulated, secure and \nhappy life. They surely had regular opportunities to take baths, we thought sadly. They surely had \ntoothbrushes and clothesbrushes, mattresses—a separate one for each of them—and monthly mail \nbringing them news of the whereabouts of their relatives, or at least of whether they were still alive \nor not. We had lost all that a long time ago. \n \nAnd how we envied those of us who had the opportunity to get into a factory and work in a \nsheltered room! It was everyone's wish to have such a lifesaving piece of luck. The scale of relative \nluck extends even further. Even among those detachments outside the camp (in one of which I was a \nmember) there were some units which were considered worse than others. One could envy a man \nwho did not have to wade in deep, muddy clay on a steep slope emptying the tubs of a small field \nrailway for twelve hours daily. Most of the daily accidents occurred on this job, and they were often \nfatal. \n \nIn other work parties the foremen maintained an apparently local tradition of dealing out numerous \nblows, which made us talk of the relative luck of not being under their command, or perhaps of \nbeing under it only temporarily. Once, by an unlucky chance, I got into such a group. If an air raid \nalarm had not interrupted us after two hours (during which time the foreman had worked on me \nespecially), making it necessary to regroup the workers afterwards, I think that I would have \nreturned to camp on one of the sledges which carried those who had died or were dying from \nexhaustion. No one can imagine the relief that the siren can bring in such a situation; not even a \nboxer who has heard the bell signifying the finish of a round and who is thus saved at the last minute \nfrom the danger of a knockout. \n \nWe were grateful for the smallest of mercies. We were glad when there was time to delouse before \ngoing to bed, although in itself this was no pleasure, as it meant standing naked in an unheated hut \nwhere icicles hung from the ceiling. But we were thankful if there was no air raid alarm during this \noperation and the lights were not switched off. If we could not do the job properly, we were kept \nawake half the night. \n \nThe meagre pleasures of camp life provided a kind of negative happiness,—\"freedom from \nsuffering,\" as Schopenhauer put it—and even that in a relative way only. Real positive pleasures, \neven small ones, were very few. I remember drawing up a kind of balance sheet of pleasures one day \nand finding that in many, many past weeks I had experienced only two pleasurable moments. One \noccurred when, on returning from work, I was admitted to the cook house after a long wait and was \nassigned to the line filing up to prisoner-cook F. He stood behind one of the huge pans and ladled \nsoup into the bowls which were held out to him by the prisoners, who hurriedly filed past. He was \nthe only cook who did not look at the men whose bowls he was filling; the only cook who dealt out \nthe soup equally, regardless of recipient, and who did not make favourites of his personal friends or \ncountrymen, picking out the potatoes for them, while the others got watery soup skimmed from the \ntop.\n\f\nBut it is not for me to pass judgment on those prisoners who put their own people above everyone \nelse. Who can throw a stone at a man who favours his friends under circumstances when, sooner or \nlater, it is a question of life or death? No man should judge unless he asks himself in absolute \nhonesty whether in a similar situation he might not have done the same. \n \nLong after I had resumed normal life again (that means a long time after my release from camp), \nsomebody showed me an illustrated weekly with photographs of prisoners lying crowded on their \nbunks, staring dully at a visitor. \"Isn't this terrible, the dreadful staring faces—everything about it.\" \n \n\"Why?\" I asked, for I genuinely did not understand. For at that moment I saw it all again: at 5:00 A.M. \nit was still pitch dark outside. I was lying on the hard boards in an earthen hut where about seventy \nof us were \"taken care of.\" We were sick and did not have to leave camp for work; we did not have \nto go on parade. We could lie all day in our little corner in the hut and doze and wait for the daily \ndistribution of bread (which, of course, was reduced for the sick) and for the daily helping of soup \n(watered down and also decreased in quantity). But how content we were; happy in spite of \neverything. While we cowered against each other to avoid any unnecessary loss of warmth, and \nwere too lazy and disinterested to move a finger unnecessarily, we heard shrill whistles and shouts \nfrom the square where the night shift had just returned and was assembling for roll call. The door \nwas flung open, and the snowstorm blew into our hut. An exhausted comrade, covered with snow, \nstumbled inside to sit down for a few minutes. But the senior warden turned him out again. It was \nstrictly forbidden to admit a stranger to a hut while a check-up on the men was in progress. How \nsorry I was for that fellow and how glad not to be in his skin at that moment, but instead to be sick \nand able to doze on in the sick quarters! What a lifesaver it was to have two days there, and perhaps \neven two extra days after those! \n \nAll this came to my mind when I saw the photographs in the magazine. When I explained, my \nlisteners understood why I did not find the photograph so terrible: the people shown on it might not \nhave been so unhappy after all. \n \nOn my fourth day in the sick quarters I had just been detailed to the night shift when the chief \ndoctor rushed in and asked me to volunteer for medical duties in another camp containing typhus \npatients. Against the urgent advice of my friends (and despite the fact that almost none of my \ncolleagues offered their services), I decided to volunteer. I knew that in a working party I would die \nin a short time. But if I had to die there might at least be some sense in my death. I thought that it \nwould doubtless be more to the purpose to try and help my comrades as a doctor than to vegetate \nor finally lose my life as the unproductive labourer that I was then. \n \nFor me this was simple mathematics, not sacrifice. But secretly, the warrant officer from the \nsanitation squad had ordered that the two doctors who had volunteered for the typhus camp should \nbe \"taken care of\" till they left. We looked so weak that he feared that he might have two additional \ncorpses on his hands, rather than two doctors. \n \nI mentioned earlier how everything that was not connected with the immediate task of keeping \noneself and one's closest friends alive lost its value. Everything was sacrificed to this end. A man's \ncharacter became involved to the point that he was caught in a mental turmoil which threatened all \nthe values he held and threw them into doubt. Under the influence of a world which no longer \nrecognized the value of human life and human dignity, which had robbed man of his will and had \nmade him an object to be exterminated (having planned, however, to make full use of him first—to \nthe last ounce of his physical resources)— under this influence the personal ego finally suffered a \nloss of values. If the man in the concentration camp did not struggle against this in a last effort to \nsave his self-respect, he lost the feeling of being an individual, a being with a mind, with inner\n\f\nfreedom and personal value. He thought of himself then as only a part of an enormous mass of \npeople; his existence descended to the level of animal life. The men were herded—sometimes to \none place then to another; sometimes driven together, then apart—like a flock of sheep without a \nthought or a will of their own. A small but dangerous pack watched them from all sides, well versed \nin methods of torture and sadism. They drove the herd incessantly, backwards and forwards, with \nshouts, kicks and blows. And we, the sheep, thought of two things only—how to evade the bad dogs \nand how to get a little food. \n \nJust like sheep that crowd timidly into the centre of a herd, each of us tried to get into the middle of \nour formations. That gave one a better chance of avoiding the blows of the guards who were \nmarching on either side and to the front and rear of our column. The central position had the added \nadvantage of affording protection against the bitter winds. It was, therefore, in an attempt to save \none's own skin that one literally tried to submerge into the crowd. This was done automatically in \nthe formations. But at other times it was a very conscious effort on our part—in conformity with one \nof the camp's most imperative laws of self-preservation: Do not be conspicuous. We tried at all \ntimes to avoid attracting the attention of the SS. \n \nThere were times, of course, when it was possible, and even necessary, to keep away from the \ncrowd. It is well known that an enforced community life, in which attention is paid to everything one \ndoes at all times, may result in an irresistible urge to get away, at least for a short while. The \nprisoner craved to be alone with himself and his thoughts. He yearned for privacy and for solitude. \nAfter my transportation to a so-called \"rest camp,\" I had the rare fortune to find solitude for about \nfive minutes at a time. Behind the earthen hut where I worked and in which were crowded about \nfifty delirious patients, there was a quiet spot in a corner of the double fence of barbed wire \nsurrounding the camp. A tent had been improvised there with a few poles and branches of trees in \norder to shelter a half-dozen corpses (the daily death rate in the camp). There was also a shaft \nleading to the water pipes. I squatted on the wooden lid of this shaft whenever my services were not \nneeded. I just sat and looked out at the green flowering slopes and the distant blue hills of the \nBavarian landscape, framed by the meshes of barbed wire. I dreamed longingly, and my thoughts \nwandered north and northeast, in the direction of my home, but I could only see clouds. \n \nThe corpses near me, crawling with lice, did not bother me. Only the steps of passing guards could \nrouse me from my dreams; or perhaps it would be a call to the sick-bay or to collect a newly arrived \nsupply of medicine for my hut— consisting of perhaps five or ten tablets of aspirin, to last for several \ndays for fifty patients. I collected them and then did my rounds, feeling the patients' pulses and \ngiving half-tablets to the serious cases. But the desperately ill received no medicine. It would not \nhave helped, and besides, it would have deprived those for whom there was still some hope. For \nlight cases, I had nothing, except perhaps a word of encouragement. In this way I dragged myself \nfrom patient to patient, though I myself was weak and exhausted from a serious attack of typhus. \nThen I went back to my lonely place on the wood cover of the water shaft. \n \nThis shaft, incidentally, once saved the lives of three fellow prisoners. Shortly before liberation, mass \ntransports were organized to go to Dachau, and these three prisoners wisely tried to avoid the trip. \nThey climbed down the shaft and hid there from the guards. I calmly sat on the lid, looking innocent \nand playing a childish game of throwing pebbles at the barbed wire. On spotting me, the guard \nhesitated for a moment, but then passed on. Soon I could tell the three men below that the worst \ndanger was over. \n \nIt is very difficult for an outsider to grasp how very little value was placed on human life in camp. The \ncamp inmate was hardened, but possibly became more conscious of this complete disregard of \nhuman existence when a convoy of sick men was arranged. The emaciated bodies of the sick were\n\f\nthrown on two-wheeled carts which were drawn by prisoners for many miles, often through \nsnowstorms, to the next camp. If one of the sick men had died before the cart left, he was thrown \non anyway—the list had to be correct I The list was the only thing that mattered. A man counted \nonly because he had a prison number. One literally became a number: dead or alive—that was \nunimportant; the life of a \"number\" was completely irrelevant. What stood behind that number and \nthat life mattered even less: the fate, the history, the name of the man. In the transport of sick \npatients that I, in my capacity as a doctor, had to accompany from one camp in Bavaria to another, \nthere was a young prisoner whose brother was not on the list and therefore would have to be left \nbehind. The young man begged so long that the camp warden decided to work an exchange, and the \nbrother took the place of a man who, at the moment, preferred to stay behind. But the list had to be \ncorrect! That was easy. The brother just exchanged numbers with the other prisoner. \n \nAs I have mentioned before, we had no documents; everyone was lucky to own his body, which, \nafter all, was still breathing. All else about us, i.e., the rags hanging from our gaunt skeletons, was \nonly of interest if we were assigned to a transport of sick patients. The departing \"Moslems\" were \nexamined with unabashed curiosity to see whether their coats or shoes were not better than one's \nown. After all, their fates were sealed. But those who stayed behind in camp, who were still capable \nof some work, had to make use of every means to improve their chances of survival. They were not \nsentimental. The prisoners saw themselves completely dependent on the moods of the guards—\nplaythings of fate—and this made them even less human than the circumstances warranted. \n \nIn Auschwitz I had laid down a rule for myself which proved to be a good one and which most of my \ncomrades later followed. I generally answered all kinds of questions truthfully. But I was silent about \nanything that was not expressly asked for. If I were asked my age, I gave it. If asked about my \nprofession, I said \"doctor,\" but did not elaborate. The first morning in Auschwitz an SS officer came \nto the parade ground. We had to fall into separate groups of prisoners: over forty years, under forty \nyears, metal workers, mechanics, and so forth. Then we were examined for ruptures and some \nprisoners had to form a new group. The group that I was in was driven to another hut, where we \nlined up again. After being sorted out once more and having answered questions as to my age and \nprofession, I was sent to another small group. Once more we were driven to another hut and \ngrouped differently. This continued for some time, and I became quite unhappy, finding myself \namong strangers who spoke unintelligible foreign languages. Then came the last selection, and I \nfound myself back in the group that had been with me in the first hut! They had barely noticed that I \nhad been sent from hut to hut in the meantime. But I was aware that in those few minutes fate had \npassed me in many different forms. \n \nWhen the transport of sick patients for the \"rest camp\" was organized, my name (that is, my \nnumber) was put on the list, since a few doctors were needed. But no one was convinced that the \ndestination was really a rest camp. A few weeks previously the same transport had been prepared. \nThen, too, everyone had thought that it was destined for the gas ovens. When it was announced \nthat anyone who volunteered for the dreaded night shift would be taken off the transport list, \neighty-two prisoners volunteered immediately. A quarter of an hour later the transport was \ncancelled, but the eighty-two stayed on the list for the night shift. For the majority of them, this \nmeant death within the next fortnight. \n \nNow the transport for the rest camp was arranged for the second time. Again no one knew whether \nthis was a ruse to obtain the last bit of work from the sick—if only for fourteen days—or whether it \nwould go to the gas ovens or to a genuine rest camp. The chief doctor, who had taken a liking to me, \ntold me furtively one evening at a quarter to ten, \"I have made it known in the orderly room that you \ncan still have your name crossed off the list; you may do so up till ten o'clock.\""

    "raw_text": "I told him that this was not my way; that I had learned to let fate take its course. \"I might as well stay \nwith my friends,\" I said. There was a look of pity in his eyes, as if he knew. . . . He shook my hand \nsilently, as though it were a farewell, not for life, but from life. Slowly I walked back to my hut. There \nI found a good friend waiting for me. \n\"You really want to go with them?\" he asked sadly. \n\"Yes, I am going.\" \nTears came to his eyes and I tried to comfort him. Then there was something else to do—to make \nmy will: \n\"Listen, Otto, if I don't get back home to my wife, and if you should see her again, then tell her that I \ntalked of her daily, hourly. You remember. Secondly, I have loved her more than anyone. Thirdly, the \nshort time I have been married to her outweighs everything, even all we have gone through here.\" \nOtto, where are you now? Are you alive? What has happened to you since our last hour together? \nDid you find your wife again? And do you remember how I made you learn my will by heart—word \nfor word—in spite of your childlike tears? \n \nThe next morning I departed with the transport. This time it was not a ruse. We were not heading \nfor the gas chambers, and we actually did go to a rest camp. Those who had pitied me remained in a \ncamp where famine was to rage even more fiercely than in our new camp. They tried to save \nthemselves, but they only sealed their own fates. Months later, after liberation, I met a friend from \nthe old camp. He related to me how he, as camp policeman, had searched for a piece of human flesh \nthat was missing from a pile of corpses. He confiscated it from a pot in which he found it cooking. \nCannibalism had broken out. I had left just in time. \n \nDoes this not bring to mind the story of Death in Teheran? A rich and mighty Persian once walked in \nhis garden with one of his servants. The servant cried that he had just encountered Death, who had \nthreatened him. He begged his master to give him his fastest horse so that he could make haste and \nflee to Teheran, which he could reach that same evening. The master consented and the servant \ngalloped off on the horse. On returning to his house the master himself met Death, and questioned \nhim, \"Why did you terrify and threaten my servant?\" \"I did not threaten him; I only showed surprise \nin still finding him here when I planned to meet him tonight in Teheran,\" said Death. \n \nThe camp inmate was frightened of making decisions and of taking any sort of initiative whatsoever. \nThis was the result of a strong feeling that fate was one's master, and that one must not try to \ninfluence it in any way, but instead let it take its own course. In addition, there was a great apathy, \nwhich contributed in no small part to the feelings of the prisoner. At times, lightning decisions had to \nbe made, decisions which spelled life or death. The prisoner would have preferred to let fate make \nthe choice for him. \n \nThis escape from commitment was most apparent when a prisoner had to make the decision for or \nagainst an escape attempt. In those minutes in which he had to make up his mind—and it was \nalways a question of minutes—he suffered the tortures of Hell. Should he make the attempt to flee? \nShould he take the risk? \n \nI, too, experienced this torment. As the battle-front drew nearer, I had the opportunity to escape. A \ncolleague of mine who had to visit huts outside the camp in the course of his medical duties wanted \nto escape and take me with him. Under the preteens of holding a consultation about a patient \nwhose illness required a specialist's advice, he smuggled me out. Outside the camp, a member of a \nforeign resistance movement was to supply us with uniforms and documents. At the last moment \nthere were some technical difficulties and we had to return to camp once more. We used this \nopportunity to provide ourselves with provisions —a few rotten potatoes—and to look for a \nrucksack.\n\f\nWe broke into an empty hut of the women's camp, which was vacant, as the women had been sent \nto another camp. The hut was in great disorder; it was obvious that many women had acquired \nsupplies and fled. There were rags, straw, rotting food, and broken crockery. Some bowls were still \nin good condition and would have been very valuable to us, but we decided not to take them. We \nknew that lately, as conditions had become desperate, they had been used not only for food, but \nalso as washbasins and chamber pots. (There was a strictly enforced rule against having any kind of \nutensil in the hut. However, some people were forced to break this rule, especially the typhus \npatients, who were much too weak to go outside even with help.) While I acted as a screen, my \nfriend broke into the hut and returned shortly with a rucksack which he hid under his coat. He had \nseen another one inside which I was to take. So we changed places and I went in. As I searched in \nthe rubbish, finding the rucksack and even a toothbrush, I suddenly saw, among all the things that \nhad been left behind, the body of a woman. \n \nI ran back to my hut to collect all my possessions: my food bowl, a pair of torn mittens \"inherited\" \nfrom a dead typhus patient, and a few scraps of paper covered with shorthand notes (on which, as I \nmentioned before, I had started to reconstruct the manuscript which I lost at Auschwitz). I made a \nquick last round of my patients, who were lying huddled on the rotten planks of wood on either side \nof the huts. I came to my only countryman, who was almost dying, and whose life it had been my \nambition to save in spite of his condition. I had to keep my intention to escape to myself, but my \ncomrade seemed to guess that something was wrong (perhaps I showed a little nervousness). In a \ntired voice he asked me, \"You, too, are getting out?\" I denied it, but I found it difficult to avoid his \nsad look. After my round I returned to him. Again a hopeless look greeted me and somehow I felt it \nto be an accusation. The unpleasant feeling that had gripped me as soon as I had told my friend I \nwould escape with him became more intense. Suddenly I decided to take fate into my own hands for \nonce. I ran out of the hut and told my friend that I could not go with him. As soon as I had told him \nwith finality that I had made up my mind to stay with my patients, the unhappy feeling left me. I did \nnot know what the following days would bring, but I had gained an inward peace that I had never \nexperienced before. I returned to the hut, sat down on the boards at my countryman's feet and tried \nto comfort him; then I chatted with the others, trying to quiet them in their delirium. \n \nOur last day in camp arrived. As the battle-front came nearer, mass transports had taken nearly all \nthe prisoners to other camps. The camp authorities, the Capos and the cooks had fled. On this day \nan order was given that the camp must be evacuated completely by sunset. Even the few remaining \nprisoners (the sick, a few doctors, and some \"nurses\") would have to leave. At night, the camp was \nto be set on fire. In the afternoon the trucks which were to collect the sick had not yet appeared. \nInstead the camp gates were suddenly closed and the barbed wire closely watched, so that no one \ncould attempt an escape. The remaining prisoners seemed to be destined to burn with the camp. For \nthe second time my friend and I decided to escape. \n \nWe had been given an order to bury three men outside the barbed wire fence. We were the only \ntwo in camp who had strength enough to do the job. Nearly all the others lay in the few huts which \nwere still in use, prostrate with fever and delirium. We now made our plans: along with the first \nbody we would smuggle out my friend's rucksack, hiding it in the old laundry tub which served as a \ncoffin. When we took out the second body we would also carry out my rucksack, and on the third \ntrip we intended to make our escape. The first two trips went according to plan. After we returned, I \nwaited while my friend tried to find a piece of bread so that we would have something to eat during \nthe next few days in the woods. I waited. Minutes passed. I became more and more impatient as he \ndid not return. After three years of imprisonment, I was picturing freedom joyously, imagining how \nwonderful it would be to run toward the battle-front. But we did not get that far.\n\f\nThe very moment when my friend came back, the camp gate was thrown open. A splendid, \naluminium-coloured car, on which were painted large red crosses, slowly rolled on to the parade \nground. A delegate from the International Red Cross in Geneva had arrived, and the camp and its \ninmates were under his protection. The delegate billeted himself in a farmhouse in the vicinity, in \norder to be near the camp at all times in case of emergency. Who worried about escape now? Boxes \nwith medicines were unloaded from the car, cigarettes were distributed, we were photographed and \njoy reigned supreme. Now there was no need for us to risk running toward the fighting line. \n \nIn our excitement we had forgotten the third body, so we carried it outside and dropped it into the \nnarrow grave we had dug for the three corpses. The guard who accompanied us—a relatively \ninoffensive man—suddenly became quite gentle. He saw that the tables might be turned and tried \nto win our goodwill. He joined in the short prayers that we offered for the dead men before \nthrowing soil over them. After the tension and excitement of the past days and hours, those last \ndays in our race with death, the words of our prayer asking for peace, were as fervent as any ever \nuttered by the human voice. \n \nAnd so the last day in camp passed in anticipation of freedom. But we had rejoiced too early. The \nRed Cross delegate had assured us that an agreement had been signed, and that the camp must not \nbe evacuated. But that night the SS arrived with trucks and brought an order to clear the camp. The \nlast remaining prisoners were to be taken to a central camp, from which they would be sent to \nSwitzerland within forty-eight hours—to be exchanged for some prisoners of war. We scarcely \nrecognized the SS. They were so friendly, trying to persuade us to get in the trucks without fear, \ntelling us that we should be grateful for our good luck. Those who were strong enough crowded into \nthe trucks and the seriously ill and feeble were lifted up with difficulty. My friend and I—we did not \nhide our rucksacks now—stood in the last group, from which thirteen would be chosen for the next \nto last truck. The chief doctor counted out the requisite number, but he omitted the two of us. The \nthirteen were loaded into the truck and we had to stay behind. Surprised, very annoyed and \ndisappointed, we blamed the chief doctor, who excused himself by saying that he had been tired \nand distracted. He said that he had thought we still intended to escape. Impatiently we sat down, \nkeeping our rucksacks on our backs, and waited with the few remaining prisoners for the last truck. \nWe had to wait a long time. Finally we lay down on the mattresses of the deserted guard-room, \nexhausted by the excitement of the last few hours and days, during which we had fluctuated \ncontinually between hope and despair. We slept in our clothes and shoes, ready for the journey. \n \nThe noise of rifles and cannons woke us; the flashes of tracer bullets and gun shots entered the hut. \nThe chief doctor dashed in and ordered us to take cover on the floor. One prisoner jumped on my \nstomach from the bed above me and with his shoes on. That awakened me all right! Then we \ngrasped what was happening: the battle-front had reached us! The shooting decreased and morning \ndawned. Outside on the pole at the camp gate a white flag floated in the wind. \n \nMany weeks later we found out that even in those last hours fate had toyed with us few remaining \nprisoners. We found out just how uncertain human decisions are, especially in matters of life and \ndeath. I was confronted with photographs which had been taken in a small camp not far from ours. \nOur friends who had thought they were travelling to freedom that night had been taken in the trucks \nto this camp, and there they were locked in the huts and burned to death. Their partially charred \nbodies were recognizable on the photograph. I thought again of Death in Teheran. \n \nApart from its role as a defensive mechanism, the prisoners' apathy was also the result of other \nfactors. Hunger and lack of sleep contributed to it (as they do in normal life, also) and to the general \nirritability which was another characteristic of the prisoners' mental state. The lack of sleep was due \npartly to the pestering of vermin which infested the terribly overcrowded huts because of the\n\f\ngeneral lack of hygiene and sanitation. The fact that we had neither nicotine nor caffeine also \ncontributed to the state of apathy and irritability. \n \nBesides these physical causes, there were mental ones, in the form of certain complexes. The \nmajority of prisoners suffered from a kind of inferiority complex. We all had once been or had \nfancied ourselves to be \"somebody.\" Now we were treated like complete nonentities. (The \nconsciousness of one's inner value is anchored in higher, more spiritual things, and cannot be shaken \nby camp life. But how many free men, let alone prisoners, possess it?) Without consciously thinking \nabout it, the average prisoner felt himself utterly degraded. This became obvious when one \nobserved the contrasts offered by the singular sociological structure of the camp. The more \n\"prominent\" prisoners, the Capos, the cooks, the store-keepers and the camp policemen, did not, as \na rule, feel degraded at all, like the majority of prisoners, but on the contrary—promoted! Some \neven developed miniature delusions of grandeur. The mental reaction of the envious and grumbling \nmajority toward this favoured minority found expression in several ways, sometimes in jokes. For \ninstance, I heard one prisoner talk to another about a Capo, saying, \"Imagine! I knew that man when \nhe was only the president of a large bank. Isn't it fortunate that he has risen so far in the world?\" \n \nWhenever the degraded majority and the promoted minority came into conflict (and there were \nplenty of opportunities for this, starting with the distribution of food) the results were explosive. \nTherefore, the general irritability (whose physical causes were discussed above) became most \nintense when these mental tensions were added. It is not surprising that this tension often ended in \na general fight. Since the prisoner continually witnessed scenes of beatings, the impulse toward \nviolence was increased. I myself felt my fists clench when anger came over me while I was famished \nand tired. I was usually very tired, since we had to stoke our stove—which we were allowed to keep \nin our hut for the typhus patients—throughout the nights. However, some of the most idyllic hours I \nhave ever spent were in the middle of the night when all the others were delirious or sleeping. I \ncould lie stretched out in front of the stove and roast a few pilfered potatoes in a fire made from \nstolen charcoal. But the following day I always felt even more tired, insensitive and irritable. \n \nWhile I was working as a doctor in the typhus block, I also had to take the place of the senior block \nwarden who was ill. Therefore, I was responsible to the camp authority for keeping the hut clean—if \n\"clean\" can be used to describe such a condition. The preteens at inspection to which the hut was \nfrequently submitted was more for the purpose of torture than of hygiene. More food and a few \ndrugs would have helped, but the only concern of the inspectors was whether a piece of straw was \nleft in the centre corridor, or whether the dirty, ragged and verminous blankets of the patients were \ntucked in neatly at their feet. As to the fate of the inmates, they were quite unconcerned. If I \nreported smartly, whipping my prison cap from my shorn head and clicking my heels, \"Hut number \nVI/9: 52 patients, two nursing orderlies, and one doctor,\" they were satisfied. And then they would \nleave. But until they arrived—often they were hours later than announced, and sometimes did not \ncome at all—I was forced to keep straightening blankets, picking up bits of straw which fell from the \nbunks, and shouting at the poor devils who tossed in their beds and threatened to upset all my \nefforts at tidiness and cleanliness. Apathy was particularly increased among the feverish patients, so \nthat they did not react at all unless they were shouted at. Even this failed at times, and then it took \ntremendous self-control not to strike them. For one's own irritability took on enormous proportions \nin the face of the other's apathy and especially in the face of the danger (i.e., the approaching \ninspection) which was caused by it. \n \nIn attempting this psychological presentation and a psychopathological explanation of the typical \ncharacteristics of a concentration camp inmate, I may give the impression that the human being is \ncompletely and unavoidably influenced by his surroundings. (In this case the surroundings being the \nunique structure of camp life, which forced the prisoner to conform his conduct to a certain set"

    "raw_text": "pattern.) But what about human liberty? Is there no spiritual freedom in regard to behaviour and \nreaction to any given surroundings? Is that theory true which would have us believe that man is no \nmore than a product of many conditional and environmental factors—be they of a biological, \npsychological or sociological nature? Is man but an accidental product of these? Most important, do \nthe prisoners' reactions to the singular world of the concentration camp prove that man cannot \nescape the influences of his surroundings? Does man have no choice of action in the face of such \ncircumstances? \n \nWe can answer these questions from experience as well as on principle. The experiences of camp life \nshow that man does have a choice of action. There were enough examples, often of a heroic nature, \nwhich proved that apathy could be overcome, irritability suppressed. Man can preserve a vestige of \nspiritual freedom, of independence of mind, even in such terrible conditions of psychic and physical \nstress. \n \nWe who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts \ncomforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but \nthey offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the \nhuman freedoms—to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own \nway. \n \nAnd there were always choices to make. Every day, every hour, offered the opportunity to make a \ndecision, a decision which determined whether you would or would not submit to those powers \nwhich threatened to rob you of your very self, your inner freedom; which determined whether or \nnot you would become the plaything of circumstance, renouncing freedom and dignity to become \nmoulded into the form of the typical inmate. \n \nSeen from this point of view, the mental reactions of the inmates of a concentration camp must \nseem more to us than the mere expression of certain physical and sociological conditions. Even \nthough conditions such as lack of sleep, insufficient food and various mental stresses may suggest \nthat the inmates were bound to react in certain ways, in the final analysis it becomes clear that the \nsort of person the prisoner became was the result of an inner decision, and not the result of camp \ninfluences alone. Fundamentally, therefore, any man can, even under such circumstances, decide \nwhat shall become of him—mentally and spiritually. He may retain his human dignity even in a \nconcentration camp. Dostoevsky said once, \"There is only one thing that I dread: not to be worthy of \nmy sufferings.\" These words frequently came to my mind after I became acquainted with those \nmartyrs whose behaviour in camp, whose suffering and death, bore witness to the fact that the last \ninner freedom cannot be lost. It can be said that they were worthy of their sufferings; the way they \nbore their suffering was a genuine inner achievement. It is this spiritual freedom— which cannot be \ntaken away—that makes life meaningful and purposeful. \n \nAn active life serves the purpose of giving man the opportunity to realize values in creative work, \nwhile a passive life of enjoyment affords him the opportunity to obtain fulfilment in experiencing \nbeauty, art, or nature. But there is also purpose in that life which is almost barren of both creation \nand enjoyment and which admits of but one possibility of high moral behaviour: namely, in man's \nattitude to his existence, an existence restricted by external forces. A creative life and a life of \nenjoyment are banned to him. But not only creativeness and enjoyment are meaningful. If there is a \nmeaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering. Suffering is an ineradicable part of \nlife, even as fate and death. Without suffering and death human life cannot be complete. \n \nThe way in which a man accepts his fate and all the suffering it entails, the way in which he takes up \nhis cross, gives him ample opportunity—even under the most difficult circumstances—to add a\n\f\ndeeper meaning to his life. It may remain brave, dignified and unselfish. Or in the bitter fight for self-\npreservation he may forget his human dignity and become no more than an animal. Here lies the \nchance for a man either to make use of or to forgo the opportunities of attaining the moral values \nthat a difficult situation may afford him. And this decides whether he is worthy of his sufferings or \nnot. \n \nDo not think that these considerations are unworldly and too far removed from real life. It is true \nthat only a few people are capable of reaching such high moral standards. Of the prisoners only a \nfew kept their full inner liberty and obtained those values which their suffering afforded, but even \none such example is sufficient proof that man's inner strength may raise him above his outward fate. \nSuch men are not only in concentration camps. Everywhere man is confronted with fate, with the \nchance of achieving something through his own suffering. \n \nTake the fate of the sick—especially those who are incurable. I once read a letter written by a young \ninvalid, in which he told a friend that he had just found out he would not live for long, that even an \noperation would be of no help. He wrote further that he remembered a film he had seen in which a \nman was portrayed who waited for death in a courageous and dignified way. The boy had thought it \na great accomplishment to meet death so well. Now—he wrote—fate was offering him a similar \nchance. \n \nThose of us who saw the film called Resurrection—taken from a book by Tolstoy—years ago, may \nhave had similar thoughts. Here were great destinies and great men. For us, at that time, there was \nno great fate; there was no chance to achieve such greatness. After the picture we went to the \nnearest cafe, and over a cup of coffee and a sandwich we forgot the strange metaphysical thoughts \nwhich for one moment had crossed our minds. But when we ourselves were confronted with a great \ndestiny and faced with the decision of meeting it with equal spiritual greatness, by then we had \nforgotten our youthful resolutions of long ago, and we failed. \n \nPerhaps there came a day for some of us when we saw the same film again, or a similar one. But by \nthen other pictures may have simultaneously unrolled before one's inner eye; pictures of people \nwho attained much more in their lives than a sentimental film could show. Some details of a \nparticular man's inner greatness may have come to one's mind, like the story of the young woman \nwhose death I witnessed in a concentration camp. It is a simple story. There is little to tell and it may \nsound as if I had invented it; but to me it seems like a poem. \n \nThis young woman knew that she would die in the next few days. But when I talked to her she was \ncheerful in spite of this knowledge. \"I am grateful that fate has hit me so hard,\" she told me. \"In my \nformer life I was spoiled and did not take spiritual accomplishments seriously.\" Pointing through the \nwindow of the hut, she said, \"This tree here is the only friend I have in my loneliness.\" Through that \nwindow she could see just one branch of a chestnut tree, and on the branch were two blossoms. \"I \noften talk to this tree,\" she said to me. I was startled and didn't quite know how to take her words. \nWas she delirious? Did she have occasional hallucinations? Anxiously I asked her if the tree replied. \n\"Yes.\" What did it say to her? She answered, \"It said to me, 'I am here—I am here—I am life, eternal \nlife.' \" \n \nWe have stated that that which was ultimately responsible for the state of the prisoner's inner self \nwas not so much the enumerated psychophysical causes as it was the result of a free decision. \nPsychological observations of the prisoners have shown that only the men who allowed their inner \nhold on their moral and spiritual selves to subside eventually fell victim to the camp's degenerating \ninfluences. The question now arises, what could, or should, have constituted this \"inner hold\"?\n\f\nFormer prisoners, when writing or relating their experiences, agree that the most depressing \ninfluence of all was that a prisoner could not know how long his term of imprisonment would be. He \nhad been given no date for his release. (In our camp it was pointless even to talk about it.) Actually a \nprison term was not only uncertain but unlimited. A well-known research psychologist has pointed \nout that life in a concentration camp could be called a \"provisional existence.\" We can add to this by \ndefining it as a \"provisional existence of unknown limit.\" \n \nNew arrivals usually knew nothing about the conditions at a camp. Those who had come back from \nother camps were obliged to keep silent, and from some camps no one had returned. On entering \ncamp a change took place in the minds of the men. With the end of uncertainty there came the \nuncertainty of the end. It was impossible to foresee whether or when, if at all, this form of existence \nwould end. \n \nThe Latin word finis has two meanings: the end or the finish, and a goal to reach. A man who could \nnot see the end of his \"provisional existence\" was not able to aim at an ultimate goal in life. He \nceased living for the future, in contrast to a man in normal life. Therefore the whole structure of his \ninner life changed; signs of decay set in which we know from other areas of life. The unemployed \nworker, for example, is in a similar position. His existence has become provisional and in a certain \nsense he cannot live for the future or aim at a goal. Research work done on unemployed miners has \nshown that they suffer from a peculiar sort of deformed time—inner time—which is a result of their \nunemployed state. Prisoners, too, suffered from this strange \"time-experience.\" In camp, a small \ntime unit, a day, for example, filled with hourly tortures and fatigue, appeared endless. A larger time \nunit, perhaps a week, seemed to pass very quickly. My comrades agreed when I said that in camp a \nday lasted longer than a week. How paradoxical was our time-experience! In this connection we are \nreminded of Thomas Mann's The Magic Mountain, which contains some very pointed psychological \nremarks. Mann studies the spiritual development of people who are in an analogous psychological \nposition, i.e., tuberculosis patients in a sanatorium who also know no date for their release. They \nexperience a similar existence—without a future and without a goal. \nOne of the prisoners, who on his arrival marched with a long column of new inmates from the \nstation to the camp, told me later that he had felt as though he were marching at his own funeral. \nHis life had seemed to him absolutely without future. He regarded it as over and done, as if he had \nalready died. This feeling of lifelessness was intensified by other causes: in time, it was the \nlimitlessness of the term of imprisonment which was most acutely felt; in space, the narrow limits of \nthe prison. Anything outside the barbed wire became remote—out of reach and, in a way, unreal. \nThe events and the people outside, all the normal life there, had a ghostly aspect for the prisoner. \nThe outside life, that is, as much as he could see of it, appeared to him almost as it might have to a \ndead man who looked at it from another world. \n \nA man who let himself decline because he could not see any future goal found himself occupied with \nretrospective thoughts. In a different connection, we have already spoken of the tendency there was \nto look into the past, to help make the present, with all its horrors, less real. But in robbing the \npresent of its reality there lay a certain danger. It became easy to overlook the opportunities to \nmake something positive of camp life, opportunities which really did exist. Regarding our \n\"provisional existence\" as unreal was in itself an important factor in causing the prisoners to lose \ntheir hold on life; everything in a way became pointless. Such people forgot that often it is just such \nan exceptionally difficult external situation which gives man the opportunity to grow spiritually \nbeyond himself. Instead of taking the camp's difficulties as a test of their inner strength, they did not \ntake their life seriously and despised it as something of no consequence. They preferred to close \ntheir eyes and to live in the past. Life for such people became meaningless.\n\f\nNaturally only a few people were capable of reaching great spiritual heights. But a few were given \nthe chance to attain human greatness even through their apparent worldly failure and death, an \naccomplishment which in ordinary circumstances they would never have achieved. To the others of \nus, the mediocre and the half-hearted, the words of Bismarck could be applied: \"Life is like being at \nthe dentist. You always think that the worst is still to come, and yet it is over already.\" Varying this, \nwe could say that most men in a concentration camp believed that the real opportunities of life had \npassed. Yet, in reality, there was an opportunity and a challenge. One could make a victory of those \nexperiences, turning life into an inner triumph, or one could ignore the challenge and simply \nvegetate, as did a majority of the prisoners. \n \nAny attempt at fighting the camp's psychopathological influence on the prisoner by \npsychotherapeutic or psycho-hygienic methods had to aim at giving him inner strength by pointing \nout to him a future goal to which he could look forward. Instinctively some of the prisoners \nattempted to find one on their own. It is a peculiarity of man that he can only live by looking to the \nfuture— sub specie aeternitatis. And this is his salvation in the most difficult moments of his \nexistence, although he sometimes has to force his mind to the task. \n \nI remember a personal experience. Almost in tears from pain (I had terrible sores on my feet from \nwearing torn shoes), I limped a few kilometres with our long column of men from the camp to our \nwork site. Very cold, bitter winds struck us. I kept thinking of the endless little problems of our \nmiserable life. What would there be to eat tonight? If a piece of sausage came as extra ration, should \nI exchange it for a piece of bread? Should I trade my last cigarette, which was left from a bonus I \nreceived a fortnight ago, for a bowl of soup? How could I get a piece of wire to replace the fragment \nwhich served as one of my shoelaces? Would I get to our work site in time to join my usual working \nparty or would I have to join another, which might have a brutal foreman? What could I do to get on \ngood terms with the Capo, who could help me to obtain work in camp instead of undertaking this \nhorribly long daily march? \n \nI became disgusted with the state of affairs which compelled me, daily and hourly, to think of only \nsuch trivial things. I forced my thoughts to turn to another subject. Suddenly I saw myself standing \non the platform of a well-lit, warm and pleasant lecture room. In front of me sat an attentive \naudience on comfortable upholstered seats. I was giving a lecture on the psychology of the \nconcentration camp! All that oppressed me at that moment became objective, seen and described \nfrom the remote viewpoint of science. By this method I succeeded somehow in rising above the \nsituation, above the sufferings of the moment, and I observed them as if they were already of the \npast. Both I and my troubles became the object of an interesting psychoscientific study undertaken \nby myself. What does Spinoza say in his Ethics?—\"Affectus, qui passio est, desinit esse passio \nsimulatque eius claram et distinctam formamus ideam.\" Emotion, which is suffering, ceases to be \nsuffering as soon as we form a clear and precise picture of it. \n \nThe prisoner who had lost faith in the future—his future —was doomed. With his loss of belief in the \nfuture, he also lost his spiritual hold; he let himself decline and became subject to mental and \nphysical decay. Usually this happened quite suddenly, in the form of a crisis, the symptoms of which \nwere familiar to the experienced camp inmate. We all feared this moment—not for ourselves, which \nwould have been pointless, but for our friends. Usually it began with the prisoner refusing one \nmorning to get dressed and wash or to go out on the parade grounds. No entreaties, no blows, no \nthreats had any effect. He just lay there, hardly moving. If this crisis was brought about by an illness, \nhe refused to be taken to the sick-bay or to do anything to help himself. He simply gave up. There he \nremained, lying in his own excreta, and nothing bothered him any more."

    "raw_text": "I once had a dramatic demonstration of the close link between the loss of faith in the future and this \ndangerous giving up. F, my senior block warden, a fairly well-known composer and librettist, \nconfided in me one day: \"I would like to tell you something, Doctor. I have had a strange dream. A \nvoice told me that I could wish for something, that I should only say what I wanted to know, and all \nmy questions would be answered. What do you think I asked? That I would like to know when the \nwar would be over for me. You know what I mean, Doctor—for me! I wanted to know when we, \nwhen our camp, would be liberated and our sufferings come to an end.\" \n \n\"And when did you have this dream?\" I asked. \"In February, 1945,\" he answered. It was then the \nbeginning of March. \n\"What did your dream voice answer?\" Furtively he whispered to me, \"March thirtieth.\" \nWhen F told me about his dream, he was still full of hope and convinced that the voice of his dream \nwould be right. But as the promised day drew nearer, the war news which reached our camp made it \nappear very unlikely that we would be free on the promised date. On March twenty-ninth, F \nsuddenly became ill and ran a high temperature. On March thirtieth, the day his prophecy had told \nhim that the war and suffering would be over for him, he became delirious and lost consciousness. \nOn March thirty-first, he was dead. To all outward appearances, he had died of typhus. \n \nThose who know how close the connection is between the state of mind of a man—his courage and \nhope, or lack of them—and the state of immunity of his body will understand that the sudden loss of \nhope and courage can have a deadly effect. The ultimate cause of my friend's death was that the \nexpected liberation did not come and he was severely disappointed. This suddenly lowered his \nbody's resistance against the latent typhus infection. His faith in the future and his will to live had \nbecome paralyzed and his body fell victim to illness—and thus the voice of his dream was right after \nall. \n \nThe observations of this one case and the conclusion drawn from them are in accordance with \nsomething that was drawn to my attention by the chief doctor of our concentration camp. The death \nrate in the week between Christmas, 1944, and New Year's, 1945, increased in camp beyond all \nprevious experience. In his opinion, the explanation for this increase did not lie in the harder \nworking conditions or the deterioration of our food supplies or a change of weather or new \nepidemics. It was simply that the majority of the prisoners had lived in the naive hope that they \nwould be home again by Christmas. As the time drew near and there was no encouraging news, the \nprisoners lost courage and disappointment overcame them. This had a dangerous influence on their \npowers of resistance and a great number of them died. \n \nAs we said before, any attempt to restore a man's inner strength in the camp had first to succeed in \nshowing him some future goal. Nietzsche's words, \"He who has a why to live for can bear with \nalmost any how,\" could be the guiding motto for all psychotherapeutic and psychohygienic efforts \nregarding prisoners. Whenever there was an opportunity for it, one had to give them a why—an \naim—for their lives, in order to strengthen them to bear the terrible how of their existence. Woe to \nhim who saw no more sense in his life, no aim, no purpose, and therefore no point in carrying on. He \nwas soon lost. The typical reply with which such a man rejected all encouraging arguments was, \"I \nhave nothing to expect from life any more.\" What sort of answer can one give to that? \n \nWhat was really needed was a fundamental change in our attitude toward life. We had to learn \nourselves and, furthermore, we had to teach the despairing men, that it did not really matter what \nwe expected from life, but rather what life expected from us. We needed to stop asking about the \nmeaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life—daily \nand hourly. Our answer must consist, not in talk and meditation, but in right action and in right\n\f\nconduct. Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and \nto fulfil the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual. \n \nThese tasks, and therefore the meaning of life, differ from man to man, and from moment to \nmoment. Thus it is impossible to define the meaning of life in a general way. Questions about the \nmeaning of life can never be answered by sweeping statements. \"Life\" does not mean something \nvague, but something very real and concrete, just as life's tasks are also very real and concrete. They \nform man's destiny, which is different and unique for each individual. No man and no destiny can be \ncompared with any other man or any other destiny. No situation repeats itself, and each situation \ncalls for a different response. Sometimes the situation in which a man finds himself may require him \nto shape his own fate by action. At other times it is more advantageous for him to make use of an \nopportunity for contemplation and to realize assets in this way. Sometimes man may be required \nsimply to accept fate, to bear his cross. Every situation is distinguished by its uniqueness, and there \nis always only one right answer to the problem posed by the situation at hand. \n \nWhen a man finds that it is his destiny to suffer, he will have to accept his suffering as his task; his \nsingle and unique task. He will have to acknowledge the fact that even in suffering he is unique and \nalone in the universe. No one can relieve him of his suffering or suffer in his place. His unique \nopportunity lies in the way in which he bears his burden. \n \nFor us, as prisoners, these thoughts were not speculations far removed from reality. They were the \nonly thoughts that could be of help to us. They kept us from despair, even when there seemed to be \nno chance of coming out of it alive. Long ago we had passed the stage of asking what was the \nmeaning of life, a naive query which understands life as the attaining of some aim through the active \ncreation of something of value. For us, the meaning of life embraced the wider cycles of life and \ndeath, of suffering and of dying. \n \nOnce the meaning of suffering had been revealed to us, we refused to minimize or alleviate the \ncamp's tortures by ignoring them or harbouring false illusions and entertaining artificial optimism. \nSuffering had become a task on which we did not want to turn out backs. We had realized its hidden \nopportunities for achievement, the opportunities which caused the poet Rilke to write, \"Wie viel ist \naufzuleiden!\"(How much suffering there is to get through!) Rilke spoke of \"getting through suffering\" \nas others would talk of \"getting through work.\" There was plenty of suffering for us to get through. \nTherefore, it was necessary to face up to the full amount of suffering, trying to keep moments of \nweakness and furtive tears to a minimum. But there was no need to be ashamed of tears, for tears \nbore witness that a man had the greatest of courage, the courage to suffer. Only very few realized \nthat. Shamefacedly some confessed occasionally that they had wept, like the comrade who \nanswered my question of how he had gotten over his oedema, by confessing, \"I have wept it out of \nmy system.\" \n \nThe tender beginnings of a psychotherapy or psycho-hygiene were, when they were possible at all in \nthe camp, either individual or collective in nature. The individual psychotherapeutic attempts were \noften a kind of \"life-saving procedure.\" These efforts were usually concerned with the prevention of \nsuicides. A very strict camp ruling forbade any efforts to save a man who attempted suicide. It was \nforbidden, for example, to cut down a man who was trying to hang himself. Therefore, it was all \nimportant to prevent these attempts from occurring. \n \nI remember two cases of would-be suicide, which bore a striking similarity to each other. Both men \nhad talked of their intentions to commit suicide. Both used the typical argument—they had nothing \nmore to expect from life. In both cases it was a question of getting them to realize that life was still \nexpecting something from them; something in the future was expected of them. We found, in fact,\n\f\nthat for the one it was his child whom he adored and who was waiting for him in a foreign country. \nFor the other it was a thing, not a person. This man was a scientist and had written a series of books \nwhich still needed to be finished. His work could not be done by anyone else, any more than another \nperson could ever take the place of the father in his child's affections. \n \nThis uniqueness and singleness which distinguishes each individual and gives a meaning to his \nexistence has a bearing on creative work as much as it does on human love. When the impossibility \nof replacing a person is realized, it allows the responsibility which a man has for his existence and its \ncontinuance to appear in all its magnitude. A man who becomes conscious of the responsibility he \nbears toward a human being who affectionately waits for him, or to an unfinished work, will never \nbe able to throw away his life. He knows the \"why\" for his existence, and will be able to bear almost \nany \"how.\" \n \nThe opportunities for collective psychotherapy were naturally limited in camp. The right example \nwas more effective than words could ever be. A senior block warden who did not side with the \nauthorities had, by his just and encouraging behaviour, a thousand opportunities to exert a far-\nreaching moral influence on those under his jurisdiction. The immediate influence of behaviour is \nalways more effective than that of words. But at times a word was effective too, when mental \nreceptiveness had been intensified by some outer circumstances. I remember an incident when \nthere was occasion for psychotherapeutic work on the inmates of a whole hut, due to an \nintensification of their receptiveness because of a certain external situation. \n \nIt had been a bad day. On parade, an announcement had been made about the many actions that \nwould, from then on, be regarded as sabotage and therefore punishable by immediate death by \nhanging. Among these were crimes such as cutting small strips from our old blankets (in order to \nimprovise ankle supports) and very minor \"thefts.\" A few days previously a semi-starved prisoner \nhad broken into the potato store to steal a few pounds of potatoes. The theft had been discovered \nand some prisoners had recognized the \"burglar.\" When the camp authorities heard about it they \nordered that the guilty man be given up to them or the whole camp would starve for a day. Naturally \nthe 2,500 men preferred to fast. \n \nOn the evening of this day of fasting we lay in our earthen huts—in a very low mood. Very little was \nsaid and every word sounded irritable. Then, to make matters even worse, the light went out. \nTempers reached their lowest ebb. But our senior block warden was a wise man. He improvised a \nlittle talk about all that was on our minds at that moment. He talked about the many comrades who \nhad died in the last few days, either of sickness or of suicide. But he also mentioned what may have \nbeen the real reason for their deaths: giving up hope. He maintained that there should be some way \nof preventing possible future victims from reaching this extreme state. And it was to me that the \nwarden pointed to give this advice. \n \nGod knows, I was not in the mood to give psychological explanations or to preach any sermons—to \noffer my comrades a kind of medical care of their souls. I was cold and hungry, irritable and tired, \nbut I had to make the effort and use this unique opportunity. Encouragement was now more \nnecessary than ever. \n \nSo I began by mentioning the most trivial of comforts first. I said that even in this Europe in the sixth \nwinter of the Second World War, our situation was not the most terrible we could think of. I said \nthat each of us had to ask himself what irreplaceable losses he had suffered up to then. I speculated \nthat for most of them these losses had really been few. Whoever was still alive had reason for hope. \nHealth, family, happiness, professional abilities, fortune, position in society—all these were things \nthat could be achieved again or restored. After all, we still had all our bones intact. Whatever we had\n\f\ngone through could still be an asset to us in the future. And I quoted from Nietzsche: \"Was mich \nnicht umbringt, macht mich starker.\" (That which does not kill me, makes me stronger.) \n \nThen I spoke about the future. I said that to the impartial the future must seem hopeless. I agreed \nthat each of us could guess for himself how small were his chances of survival. I told them that \nalthough there was still no typhus epidemic in the camp, I estimated my own chances at about one \nin twenty. But I also told them that, in spite of this, I had no intention of losing hope and giving up. \nFor no man knew what the future would bring, much less the next hour. Even if we could not expect \nany sensational military events in the next few days, who knew better than we, with our experience \nof camps, how great chances sometimes opened up, quite suddenly, at least for the individual. For \ninstance, one might be attached unexpectedly to a special group with exceptionally good working \nconditions—for this was the kind of thing which constituted the \"luck\" of the prisoner. \n \nBut I did not only talk of the future and the veil which was drawn over it. I also mentioned the past; \nall its joys, and how its light shone even in the present darkness. Again I quoted a poet—to avoid \nsounding like a preacher myself —who had written, \"Was Du erlebst, kann keine Macht der Welt Dir \nrauben.\" (What you have experienced, no power on earth can take from you.) Not only our \nexperiences, but all we have done, whatever great thoughts we may have had, and all we have \nsuffered, all this is not lost, though it is past; we have brought it into being. Having been is also a \nkind of being, and perhaps the surest kind. \n \nThen I spoke of the many opportunities of giving life a meaning. I told my comrades (who lay \nmotionless, although occasionally a sigh could be heard) that human life, under any circumstances, \nnever ceases to have a meaning, and that this infinite meaning of life includes suffering and dying, \nprivation and death. I asked the poor creatures who listened to me attentively in the darkness of the \nhut to face up to the seriousness of our position. They must not lose hope but should keep their \ncourage in the certainty that the hopelessness of our struggle did not detract from its dignity and its \nmeaning. I said that someone looks down on each of us in difficult hours—a friend, a wife, \nsomebody alive or dead, or a God—and he would not expect us to disappoint him. He would hope to \nfind us suffering proudly—not miserably—knowing how to die. \n \nAnd finally I spoke of our sacrifice, which had meaning in every case. It was in the nature of this \nsacrifice that it should appear to be pointless in the normal world, the world of material success. But \nin reality our sacrifice did have a meaning. Those of us who had any religious faith, I said frankly, \ncould understand without difficulty. I told them of a comrade who on his arrival in camp had tried to \nmake a pact with Heaven that his suffering and death should save the human being he loved from a \npainful end. For this man, suffering and death were meaningful; his was a sacrifice of the deepest \nsignificance. He did not want to die for nothing. None of us wanted that. \n \nThe purpose of my words was to find a full meaning in our life, then and there, in that hut and in \nthat practically hopeless situation. I saw that my efforts had been successful. When the electric bulb \nflared up again, I saw the miserable figures of my friends limping toward me to thank me with tears \nin their eyes. But I have to confess here that only too rarely had I the inner strength to make contact \nwith my companions in suffering and that I must have missed many opportunities for doing so. \n \nWe now come to the third stage of a prisoner's mental reactions: the psychology of the prisoner \nafter his liberation. But prior to that we shall consider a question which the psychologist is asked \nfrequently, especially when he has personal knowledge of these matters: What can you tell us about \nthe psychological make-up of the camp guards? How is it possible that men of flesh and blood could \ntreat others as so many prisoners say they have been treated? Having once heard these accounts \nand having come to believe that these things did happen, one is bound to ask how, psychologically,\n\f\nthey could happen. To answer this question without going into great detail, a few things must be \npointed out: \n \nFirst, among the guards there were some sadists, sadists in the purest clinical sense. \nSecond, these sadists were always selected when a really severe detachment of guards was needed. \nThere was great joy at our work site when we had permission to warm ourselves for a few minutes \n(after two hours of work in the bitter frost) in front of a little stove which was fed with twigs and \nscraps of wood. But there were always some foremen who found a great pleasure in taking this \ncomfort from us. How clearly their faces reflected this pleasure when they not only forbade us to \nstand there but turned over the stove and dumped its lovely fire into the snow! When the SS took a \ndislike to a person, there was always some special man in their ranks known to have a passion for, \nand to be highly specialized in, sadistic torture, to whom the unfortunate prisoner was sent. \nThird, the feelings of the majority of the guards had been dulled by the number of years in which, in \never-increasing doses, they had witnessed the brutal methods of the camp. These morally and \nmentally hardened men at least refused to take active part in sadistic measures. But they did not \nprevent others from carrying them out. \nFourth, it must be stated that even among the guards there were some who took pity on us. I shall \nonly mention the commander of the camp from which I was liberated. It was found after the \nliberation—only the camp doctor, a prisoner himself, had known of it previously—that this man had \npaid no small sum of money from his own pocket in order to purchase medicines for his prisoners \nfrom the nearest market town.1 But the senior camp warden, a prisoner himself, was harder than \nany of the SS guards. He beat the other prisoners at every slightest opportunity, while the camp \ncommander, to my knowledge, never once lifted his hand against any of us. \n \n1 An interesting incident with reference to this SS commander is in regard to the attitude toward him of some of his Jewish \nprisoners. At the end of the war when the American troops liberated the prisoners from our camp, three young Hungarian \nJews hid this commander in the Bavarian woods. Then they went to the commandant of the American Forces who was very \neager to capture this SS commander and they said they would tell him where he was but only under certain conditions: the \nAmerican commander must promise that absolutely no harm would come to this man. After a while, the American officer \nfinally promised these young Jews that the SS commander when taken into captivity would be kept safe from harm. Not \nonly did the American officer keep his promise but, as a matter of fact, the former SS commander of this concentration \ncamp was in a sense restored to his command, for he supervised the collection of clothing among the nearby Bavarian \nvillages, and its distribution to all of us who at that time still wore the clothes we had inherited from other inmates of \nCamp Auschwitz who were not as fortunate as we, having been sent to the gas chamber immediately upon their arrival at \nthe railway station. \n \nIt is apparent that the mere knowledge that a man was either a camp guard or a prisoner tells us \nalmost nothing. Human kindness can be found in all groups, even those which as a whole it would be \neasy to condemn. The boundaries between groups overlapped and we must not try to simplify \nmatters by saying that these men were angels and those were devils. Certainly, it was a considerable \nachievement for a guard or foreman to be kind to the prisoners in spite of all the camp's influences, \nand, on the other hand, the baseness of a prisoner who treated his own companions badly was \nexceptionally contemptible. Obviously the prisoners found the lack of character in such men \nespecially upsetting, while they were profoundly moved by the smallest kindness received from any \nof the guards. I remember how one day a foreman secretly gave me a piece o£ bread which I knew \nhe must have saved from his breakfast ration. It was far more than the small piece of bread which \nmoved me to tears at that time. It was the human \"something\" which this man also gave to me—the \nword and look which accompanied the gift. \n \nFrom all this we may learn that there are two races of men in this world, but only these two—the \n\"race\" of the decent man and the \"race\" of the indecent man. Both are found everywhere; they \npenetrate into all groups of society. No group consists entirely of decent or indecent people. In this\n\f\nsense, no group is of \"pure race\"—and therefore one occasionally found a decent fellow among the \ncamp guards. \n \nLife in a concentration camp tore open the human soul and exposed its depths. Is it surprising that in \nthose depths we again found only human qualities which in their very nature were a mixture of good \nand evil? The rift dividing good from evil, which goes through all human beings, reaches into the \nlowest depths and becomes apparent even on the bottom of the abyss which is laid open by the \nconcentration camp. \n \nAnd now to the last chapter in the psychology of a concentration camp—the psychology of the \nprisoner who has been released. In describing the experiences of liberation, which naturally must be \npersonal, we shall pick up the threads of that part of our narrative which told of the morning when \nthe white flag was hoisted above the camp gates after days of high tension. This state of inner \nsuspense was followed by total relaxation. But it would be quite wrong to think that we went mad \nwith joy. What, then, did happen? \n \nWith tired steps we prisoners dragged ourselves to the camp gates. Timidly we looked around and \nglanced at each other questioningly. Then we ventured a few steps out of camp. This time no orders \nwere shouted at us, nor was there any need to duck quickly to avoid a blow or kick. Oh no! This time \nthe guards offered us cigarettes! We hardly recognized them at first; they had hurriedly changed \ninto civilian clothes. We walked slowly along the road leading from the camp. Soon our legs hurt and \nthreatened to buckle. But we limped on; we wanted to see the camp's surroundings for the first time \nwith the eyes of free men. \"Freedom\"—we repeated to ourselves, and yet we could not grasp it. We \nhad said this word so often during all the years we dreamed about it, that it had lost its meaning. Its \nreality did not penetrate into our consciousness; we could not grasp the fact that freedom was ours. \n \nWe came to meadows full of flowers. We saw and realized that they were there, but we had no \nfeelings about them. The first spark of joy came when we saw a rooster with a tail of multicoloured \nfeathers. But it remained only a spark; we did not yet belong to this world. \n \nIn the evening when we all met again in our hut, one said secretly to the other, \"Tell me, were you \npleased today?\" \nAnd the other replied, feeling ashamed as he did not know that we all felt similarly, \"Truthfully, no!\" \nWe had literally lost the ability to feel pleased and had to relearn it slowly. \n \nPsychologically, what was happening to the liberated prisoners could be called \"depersonalization.\" \nEverything appeared unreal, unlikely, as in a dream. We could not believe it was true. How often in \nthe past years had we been deceived by dreams! We dreamt that the day of liberation had come, \nthat we had been set free, had returned home, greeted our friends, embraced our wives, sat down \nat the table and started to tell of all the things we had gone through—even of how we had often \nseen the day of liberation in our dreams. And then—a whistle shrilled in our ears, the signal to get \nup, and our dreams of freedom came to an end. And now the dream had come true. But could we \ntruly believe in it? \n \nHow long I knelt there and repeated this sentence memory can no longer recall. But I know that on \nthat day, in that hour, my new life started. Step for step I progressed, until I again became a human \nbeing. \n \nThe body has fewer inhibitions than the mind. It made good use of the new freedom from the first \nmoment on. It began to eat ravenously, for hours and days, even half the night. It is amazing what \nquantities one can eat. And when one of the prisoners was invited out by a friendly farmer in the\n\f\nneighbourhood, he ate and ate and then drank coffee, which loosened his tongue, and he then \nbegan to talk, often for hours. The pressure which had been on his mind for years was released at \nlast. Hearing him talk, one got the impression that he had to talk, that his desire to speak was \nirresistible. I have known people who have been under heavy pressure only for a short time (for \nexample, through a cross-examination by the Gestapo) to have similar reactions. Many days passed, \nuntil not only the tongue was loosened, but something within oneself as well; then feeling suddenly \nbroke through the strange fetters which had restrained it. \n \nOne day, a few days after the liberation, I walked through the country past flowering meadows, for \nmiles and miles, toward the market town near the camp. Larks rose to the sky and I could hear their \njoyous song. There was no one to be seen for miles around; there was nothing but the wide earth \nand sky and the larks' jubilation and the freedom of space. I stopped, looked around, and up to the \nsky—and then I went down on my knees. At that moment there was very little I knew of myself or of \nthe world—I had but one sentence in mind—always the same: \"I called to the Lord from my narrow \nprison and He answered me in the freedom of space.\" \n \nThe way that led from the acute mental tension of the last days in camp (from that war of nerves to \nmental peace) was certainly not free from obstacles. It would be an error to think that a liberated \nprisoner was not in need of spiritual care any more. We have to consider that a man who has been \nunder such enormous mental pressure for such a long time is naturally in some danger after his \nliberation, especially since the pressure was released quite suddenly. This danger (in the sense of \npsychological hygiene) is the psychological counterpart of the bends. Just as the physical health of \nthe caisson worker would be endangered if he left his diver's chamber suddenly (where he is under \nenormous atmospheric pressure), so the man who has suddenly been liberated from mental \npressure can suffer damage to his moral and spiritual health. \n \nDuring this psychological phase one observed that people with natures of a more primitive kind \ncould not escape the influences of the brutality which had surrounded them in camp life. Now, being \nfree, they thought they could use their freedom licentiously and ruthlessly. The only thing that had \nchanged for them was that they were now the oppressors instead of the oppressed. They became \ninstigators, not objects, of wilful force and injustice. They justified their behaviour by their own \nterrible experiences. This was often revealed in apparently insignificant events. A friend was walking \nacross a field with me toward the camp when suddenly we came to a field of green crops. \nAutomatically, I avoided it, but he drew his arm through mine and dragged me through it. I \nstammered something about not treading down the young crops. He became annoyed, gave me an \nangry look and shouted, \"You don't say! And hasn't enough been taken from us? My wife and child \nhave been gassed—not to mention everything else—and you would forbid me to tread on a few \nstalks of oats!\" \n \nOnly slowly could these men be guided back to the commonplace truth that no one has the right to \ndo wrong, not even if wrong has been done to them. We had to strive to lead them back to this \ntruth, or the consequences would have been much worse than the loss of a few thousand stalks of \noats. I can still see the prisoner who rolled up his shirt sleeves, thrust his right hand under my nose \nand shouted, \"May this hand be cut off if I don't stain it with blood on the day when I get home!\" I \nwant to emphasize that the man who said these words was not a bad fellow. He had been the best \nof comrades in camp and afterwards. \n \nApart from the moral deformity resulting from the sudden release of mental pressure, there were \ntwo other fundamental experiences which threatened to damage the character of the liberated \nprisoner: bitterness and disillusionment when he returned to his former life."

    "raw_text": "Bitterness was caused by a number of things he came up against in his former home town. When, on \nhis return, a man found that in many places he was met only with a shrug of the shoulders and with \nhackneyed phrases, he tended to become bitter and to ask himself why he had gone through all that \nhe had. When he heard the same phrases nearly everywhere—\"We did not know about it,\" and \n\"We, too, have suffered,\" then he asked himself, have they really nothing better to say to me? \n \nThe experience of disillusionment is different. Here it was not one's fellow man (whose superficiality \nand lack of feeling was so disgusting that one finally felt like creeping into a hole and neither hearing \nnor seeing human beings any more) but fate itself which seemed so cruel. A man who for years had \nthought he had reached the absolute limit of all possible suffering now found that suffering has no \nlimits, and that he could suffer still more, and still more intensely. \n \nWhen we spoke about attempts to give a man in camp mental courage, we said that he had to be \nshown something to look forward to in the future. He had to be reminded that life still waited for \nhim, that a human being waited for his return. But after liberation? There were some men who \nfound that no one awaited them. Woe to him who found that the person whose memory alone had \ngiven him courage in camp did not exist any more! Woe to him who, when the day of his dreams \nfinally came, found it so different from all he had longed for! Perhaps he boarded a trolley, travelled \nout to the home which he had seen for years in his mind, and only in his mind, and pressed the bell, \njust as he has longed to do in thousands of dreams, only to find that the person who should open \nthe door was not there, and would never be there again. \n \nWe all said to each other in camp that there could be no earthly happiness which could compensate \nfor all we had suffered. We were not hoping for happiness—it was not that which gave us courage \nand gave meaning to our suffering, our sacrifices and our dying. And yet we were not prepared for \nunhappiness. This disillusionment, which awaited not a small number of prisoners, was an \nexperience which these men have found very hard to get over and which, for a psychiatrist, is also \nvery difficult to help them overcome. But this must not be a discouragement to him; on the contrary, \nit should provide an added stimulus. \n \nBut for every one of the liberated prisoners, the day comes when, looking back on his camp \nexperiences, he can no longer understand how he endured it all. As the day of his liberation \neventually came, when everything seemed to him like a beautiful dream, so also the day comes \nwhen all his camp experiences seem to him nothing but a nightmare. The crowning experience of all, \nfor the homecoming man, is the wonderful feeling that, after all he has suffered, there is nothing he \nneed fear any more—except his God."

    "raw_text": "PART TWO \n \nLogotherapy in a Nutshell \nThis part, which has been revised and updated, first appeared as \"Basic Concepts of Logotherapy\" in the 1968 edition of \nMan's Search for Meaning. \n \nREADERS OF MY SHORT AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL STORY usually ask for a fuller and more direct explanation of my \ntherapeutic doctrine. Accordingly I added a brief section on logotherapy to the original edition of \nFrom Death-Camp to Existentialism. But that was not enough, and I have been besieged by requests \nfor a more extended treatment. Therefore in the present edition I have completely rewritten and \nconsiderably expanded my account. \n \nThe assignment was not easy. To convey to the reader within a short space all the material which \nrequired twenty volumes in German is an almost hopeless task. I am reminded of the American \ndoctor who once turned up in my office in Vienna and asked me, \"Now, Doctor, are you a \npsychoanalyst?\" Whereupon I replied, \"Not exactly a psychoanalyst; let's say a psychotherapist.\" \nThen he continued questioning me: \"What school do you stand for?\" I answered, \"It is my own \ntheory; it is called logotherapy.\" \"Can you tell me in one sentence what is meant by logo-therapy?\" \nhe asked. \"At least, what is the difference between psychoanalysis and logotherapy?\" \"Yes,\" I said, \n\"but in the first place, can you tell me in one sentence what you think the essence of psychoanalysis \nis?\" This was his answer: \"During psychoanalysis, the patient must lie down on a couch and tell you \nthings which sometimes are very disagreeable to tell.\" Whereupon I immediately retorted with the \nfollowing improvisation: \"Now, in logotherapy the patient may remain sitting erect but he must hear \nthings which sometimes are very disagreeable to hear.\" \n \nOf course, this was meant facetiously and not as a capsule version of logotherapy. However, there is \nsomething in it, inasmuch as logotherapy, in comparison with psychoanalysis, is a method less \nretrospective and less introspective. Logotherapy focuses rather on the future, that is to say, on the \nmeanings to be fulfilled by the patient in his future. (Logotherapy, indeed, is a meaning-cantered \npsychotherapy.) At the same time, logotherapy defocuses all the vicious-circle formations and \nfeedback mechanisms which play such a great role in the development of neuroses. Thus, the typical \nself-centeredness of the neurotic is broken up instead of being continually fostered and reinforced. \nTo be sure, this kind of statement is an oversimplification; yet in logotherapy the patient is actually \nconfronted with and reoriented toward the meaning of his life. And to make him aware of this \nmeaning can contribute much to his ability to overcome his neurosis. \n \nLet me explain why I have employed the term \"logotherapy\" as the name for my theory. Logos is a \nGreek word which denotes \"meaning.\" Logotherapy, or, as it has been called by some authors, \"The \nThird Viennese School of Psychotherapy,\" focuses on the meaning of human existence as well as on \nman's search for such a meaning. According to logotherapy, this striving to find a meaning in one's \nlife is the primary motivational force in man. That is why I speak of a will to meaning in contrast to \nthe pleasure principle (or, as we could also term it, the will to pleasure) on which Freudian \npsychoanalysis is cantered, as well as in contrast to the will to power on which Adlerian psychology, \nusing the term \"striving for superiority,\" is focused. \n \nTHE WILL TO MEANING \nMan's search for meaning is the primary motivation in his life and not a \"secondary rationalization\" \nof instinctual drives. This meaning is unique and specific in that it must and can be fulfilled by him \nalone; only then does it achieve a significance which will satisfy his own will to meaning. There are \nsome authors who contend that meanings and values are \"nothing but defence mechanisms,\n\f\nreaction formations and sublimations.\" But as for myself, I would not be willing to live merely for the \nsake of my \"defence mechanisms,\" nor would I be ready to die merely for the sake of my \"reaction \nformations.\" Man, however, is able to live and even to die for the sake of his ideals and values! \n \nA public-opinion poll was conducted a few years ago in France. The results showed that 89 percent \nof the people polled admitted that man needs \"something\" for the sake of which to live. Moreover, \n61 percent conceded that there was something, or someone, in their own lives for whose sake they \nwere even ready to die. I repeated this poll at my hospital department in Vienna among both the \npatients and the personnel, and the outcome was practically the same as among the thousands of \npeople screened in France; the difference was only 2 percent. \n \nAnother statistical survey, of 7,948 students at forty-eight colleges, was conducted by social \nscientists from Johns Hopkins University. Their preliminary report is part of a two-year study \nsponsored by the National Institute of Mental Health. Asked what they considered \"very important\" \nto them now, 16 percent of the students checked \"making a lot of money\"; 78 percent said their first \ngoal was \"finding a purpose and meaning to my life.\" \n \nOf course, there may be some cases in which an individual's concern with values is really a \ncamouflage of hidden inner conflicts; but, if so, they represent the exceptions from the rule rather \nthan the rule itself. In these cases we have actually to deal with pseudovalues, and as such they have \nto be unmasked. Unmasking, however, should stop as soon as one is confronted with what is \nauthentic and genuine in man, e.g., man's desire for a life that is as meaningful as possible. If it does \nnot stop then, the only thing that the \"unmasking psychologist\" really unmasks is his own \"hidden \nmotive\"—namely, his unconscious need to debase and depreciate what is genuine, what is genuinely \nhuman, in man. \n \nEXISTENTIAL FRUSTRATION \nMan's will to meaning can also be frustrated, in which case logotherapy speaks of \"existential \nfrustration.\" The term \"existential\" may be used in three ways: to refer to (1) existence itself, i.e., the \nspecifically human mode of being; (2) the meaning of existence; and (3) the striving to find a \nconcrete meaning in personal existence, that is to say, the will to meaning. \n \nExistential frustration can also result in neuroses. For this type of neuroses, logotherapy has coined \nthe term \"noogenic neuroses\" in contrast to neuroses in the traditional sense of the word, i.e., \npsychogenic neuroses. Noogenic neuroses have their origin not in the psychological but rather in the \n\"noological\" (from the Greek noos meaning mind) dimension of human existence. This is another \nlogotherapeutic term which denotes anything pertaining to the specifically human dimension. \n \nNOOGENIC NEUROSES \nNoogenic neuroses do not emerge from conflicts between drives and instincts but rather from \nexistential problems. Among such problems, the frustration of the will to meaning plays a large role. \nIt is obvious that in noogenic cases the appropriate and adequate therapy is not psychotherapy in \ngeneral but rather logotherapy; a therapy, that is, which dares to enter the specifically human \ndimension. \n \nLet me quote the following instance: A high-ranking American diplomat came to my office in Vienna \nin order to continue psychoanalytic treatment which he had begun five years previously with an \nanalyst in New York. At the outset I asked him why he thought he should be analyzed, why his \nanalysis had been started in the first place. It turned out that the patient was discontented with his \ncareer and found it most difficult to comply with American foreign policy. His analyst, however, had \ntold him again and again that he should try to reconcile himself with his father; because the\n\f\ngovernment of the U.S. as well as his superiors were \"nothing but\" father images and, consequently, \nhis dissatisfaction with his job was due to the hatred he unconsciously harboured toward his father. \nThrough an analysis lasting five years, the patient had been prompted more and more to accept his \nanalyst's interpretations until he finally was unable to see the forest of reality for the trees of \nsymbols and images. After a few interviews, it was clear that his will to meaning was frustrated by \nhis vocation, and he actually longed to be engaged in some other kind of work. As there was no \nreason for not giving up his profession and embarking on a different one, he did so, with most \ngratifying results. He has remained contented in this new occupation for over five years, as he \nrecently reported. I doubt that, in this case, I was dealing with a neurotic condition at all, and that is \nwhy I thought that he did not need any psychotherapy, nor even logotherapy, for the simple reason \nthat he was not actually a patient. Not every conflict is necessarily neurotic; some amount of conflict \nis normal and healthy. In a similar sense suffering is not always a pathological phenomenon; rather \nthan being a symptom of neurosis, suffering may well be a human achievement, especially if the \nsuffering grows out of existential frustration. I would strictly deny that one's search for a meaning to \nhis existence, or even his doubt of it, in every case is derived from, or results in, any disease. \nExistential frustration is in itself neither pathological nor pathogenic. A man's concern, even his \ndespair, over the worthwhileness of life is an existential distress but by no means a mental disease. It \nmay well be that interpreting the first in terms of the latter motivates a doctor to bury his patient's \nexistential despair under a heap of tranquilizing drugs. It is his task, rather, to pilot the patient \nthrough his existential crises of growth and development. \n \nLogotherapy regards its assignment as that of assisting the patient to find meaning in his life. \nInasmuch as logotherapy makes him aware of the hidden logos of his existence, it is an analytical \nprocess. To this extent, logotherapy resembles psychoanalysis. However, in logotherapy's attempt to \nmake something conscious again it does not restrict its activity to instinctual facts within the \nindividual's unconscious but also cares for existential realities, such as the potential meaning of his \nexistence to be fulfilled as well as his will to meaning. Any analysis, however, even when it refrains \nfrom including the noological dimension in its therapeutic process, tries to make the patient aware \nof what he actually longs for in the depth of his being. Logotherapy deviates from psychoanalysis \ninsofar as it considers man a being whose main concern consists in fulfilling a meaning, rather than \nin the mere gratification and satisfaction of drives and instincts, or in merely reconciling the \nconflicting claims of id, ego and superego, or in the mere adaptation and adjustment to society and \nenvironment. \n \nNOO-DYNAMICS \nTo be sure, man's search for meaning may arouse inner tension rather than inner equilibrium. \nHowever, precisely such tension is an indispensable prerequisite of mental health. There is nothing \nin the world, I venture to say, that would so effectively help one to survive even the worst conditions \nas the knowledge that there is a meaning in one's life. There is much wisdom in the words of \nNietzsche: \"He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.\" I can see in these words a motto \nwhich holds true for any psychotherapy. In the Nazi concentration camps, one could have witnessed \nthat those who knew that there was a task waiting for them to fulfil were most apt to survive. The \nsame conclusion has since been reached by other authors of books on concentration camps, and \nalso by psychiatric investigations into Japanese, North Korean and North Vietnamese prisoner-of-\nwar camps. \n \nAs for myself, when I was taken to the concentration camp of Auschwitz, a manuscript of mine ready \nfor publication was confiscated.1 Certainly, my deep desire to write this manuscript anew helped \nme to survive the rigors of the camps I was in. For instance, when in a camp in Bavaria I fell ill with \ntyphus fever, I jotted down on little scraps of paper many notes intended to enable me to rewrite \nthe manuscript, should I live to the day of liberation. I am sure that this reconstruction of my lost"

    "raw_text": "manuscript in the dark barracks of a Bavarian concentration camp assisted me in overcoming the \ndanger of cardiovascular collapse. \n \n1 It was the first version of my first book, the English translation of which was published by Alfred A. Knopf, New York, in \n1955, under the title The Doctor and the Soul: An Introduction to Logotherapy. \n \nThus it can be seen that mental health is based on a certain degree of tension, the tension between \nwhat one has already achieved and what one still ought to accomplish, or the gap between what one \nis and what one should become. Such a tension is inherent in the human being and therefore is \nindispensable to mental well-being. We should not, then, be hesitant about challenging man with a \npotential meaning for him to fulfil. It is only thus that we evoke his will to meaning from its state of \nlatency. I consider it a dangerous misconception of mental hygiene to assume that what man needs \nin the first place is equilibrium or, as it is called in biology, \"homeostasis,\" i.e., a tensionless state. \nWhat man actually needs is not a tensionless state but rather the striving and struggling for a \nworthwhile goal, a freely chosen task. What he needs is not the discharge of tension at any cost but \nthe call of a potential meaning waiting to be fulfilled by him. What man needs is not homeostasis but \nwhat I call \"nod-dynamics,\" i.e., the existential dynamics in a polar field of tension where one pole is \nrepresented by a meaning that is to be fulfilled and the other pole by the man who has to fulfil it. \nAnd one should not think that this holds true only for normal conditions; in neurotic individuals, it is \neven more valid. If architects want to strengthen a decrepit arch, they increase the load which is laid \nupon it, for thereby the parts are joined more firmly together. So if therapists wish to foster their \npatients' mental health, they should not be afraid to create a sound amount of tension through a \nreorientation toward the meaning of one's life. \n \nHaving shown the beneficial impact of meaning orientation, I turn to the detrimental influence of \nthat feeling of which so many patients complain today, namely, the feeling of the total and ultimate \nmeaninglessness of their lives. \n \nThey lack the awareness of a meaning worth living for. They are haunted by the experience of their \ninner emptiness, a void within themselves; they are caught in that situation which I have called the \n\"existential vacuum.\" \n \nTHE EXISTENTIAL VACUUM \nThe existential vacuum is a widespread phenomenon of the twentieth century. This is \nunderstandable; it may be due to a twofold loss which man has had to undergo since he became a \ntruly human being. At the beginning of human history, man lost some of the basic animal instincts in \nwhich an animal's behaviour is imbedded and by which it is secured. Such security, like Paradise, is \nclosed to man forever; man has to make choices. In addition to this, however, man has suffered \nanother loss in his more recent development inasmuch as the traditions which buttressed his \nbehaviour are now rapidly diminishing. No instinct tells him. what he has to do, and no tradition tells \nhim what he ought to do; sometimes he does not even know what he wishes to do. Instead, he \neither wishes to do what other people do (conformism) or he does what other people wish him to \ndo (totalitarianism). \n \nA statistical survey recently revealed that among my European students, 25 percent showed a more-\nor-less marked degree of existential vacuum. Among my American students it was not 25 but 60 \npercent. \n \nThe existential vacuum manifests itself mainly in a state of boredom. Now we can understand \nSchopenhauer when he said that mankind was apparently doomed to vacillate eternally between \nthe two extremes of distress and boredom. In actual fact, boredom is now causing, and certainly \nbringing to psychiatrists, more problems to solve than distress. And these problems are growing\n\f\nincreasingly crucial, for progressive automation will probably lead to an enormous increase in the \nleisure hours available to the average worker. The pity of it is that many of these will not know what \nto do with all their newly acquired free time. \n \nLet us consider, for instance, \"Sunday neurosis,\" that kind of depression which afflicts people who \nbecome aware of the lack of content in their lives when the rush of the busy week is over and the \nvoid within themselves becomes manifest. Not a few cases of suicide can be traced back to this \nexistential vacuum. Such widespread phenomena as depression, aggression and addiction are not \nunderstandable unless we recognize the existential vacuum underlying them. This is also true of the \ncrises of pensioners and aging people. \n \nMoreover, there are various masks and guises under which the existential vacuum appears. \nSometimes the frustrated will to meaning is vicariously compensated for by a will to power, \nincluding the most primitive form of the will to power, the will to money. In other cases, the place of \nfrustrated will to meaning is taken by the will to pleasure. That is why existential frustration often \neventuates in sexual compensation. We can observe in such cases that the sexual libido becomes \nrampant in the existential vacuum. \n \nAn analogous event occurs in neurotic cases. There are certain types of feedback mechanisms and \nvicious-circle formations which I will touch upon later. One can observe again and again, however, \nthat this symptomatology has invaded an existential vacuum wherein it then continues to flourish. In \nsuch patients, what we have to deal with is not a noogenic neurosis. However, we will never succeed \nin having the patient overcome his condition if we have not supplemented the psychotherapeutic \ntreatment with logo-therapy. For by filling the existential vacuum, the patient will be prevented from \nsuffering further relapses. Therefore, logotherapy is indicated not only in noogenic cases, as pointed \nout above, but also in psychogenic cases, and sometimes even the somatogenic (pseudo-) neuroses. \nViewed in this light, a statement once made by Magda B. Arnold is justified: \"Every therapy must in \nsome way, no matter how restricted, also be logotherapy.\"2 \n \nLet us now consider what we can do if a patient asks what the meaning of his life is. \n \n2 Magda B. Arnold and John A. Gasson, The Human Person, Ronald Press, New York, 1954, p. 618. \n \nTHE MEANING OF LIFE \nI doubt whether a doctor can answer this question in general terms. For the meaning of life differs \nfrom man to man, from day to day and from hour to hour. What matters, therefore, is not the \nmeaning of life in general but rather the specific meaning of a person's life at a given moment. To \nput the question in general terms would be comparable to the question posed to a chess champion: \n\"Tell me, Master, what is the best move in the world?\" There simply is no such thing as the best or \neven a good move apart from a particular situation in a game and the particular personality of one's \nopponent. The same holds for human existence. One should not search for an abstract meaning of \nlife. Everyone has his own specific vocation or mission in life to carry out a concrete assignment \nwhich demands fulfilment. Therein he cannot be replaced, nor can his life be repeated. Thus, \neveryone's task is as unique as is his specific opportunity to implement it. \n \nAs each situation in life represents a challenge to man and presents a problem for him to solve, the \nquestion of the meaning of life may actually be reversed. Ultimately, man should not ask what the \nmeaning of his life is, but rather he must recognize that it is he who is asked. In a word, each man is \nquestioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only \nrespond by being responsible. Thus, logotherapy sees in responsibleness the very essence of human \nexistence.\n\f\nTHE ESSENCE OF EXISTENCE \nThis emphasis on responsibleness is reflected in the categorical imperative of logotherapy, which is: \n\"Live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as \nwrongly as you are about to act now!\" It seems to me that there is nothing which would stimulate a \nman's sense of responsibleness more than this maxim, which invites him to imagine first that the \npresent is past and, second, that the past may yet be changed and amended. Such a precept \nconfronts him with life's finiteness as well as the finality of what he makes out of both his life and \nhimself. \n \nLogotherapy tries to make the patient fully aware of his own responsibleness; therefore, it must \nleave to him the option for what, to what, or to whom he understands himself to be responsible. \nThat is why a logotherapist is the least tempted of all psychotherapists to impose value judgments \non his patients, for he will never permit the patient to pass to the doctor the responsibility of \njudging. \n \nIt is, therefore, up to the patient to decide whether he should interpret his life task as being \nresponsible to society or to his own conscience. There are people, however, who do not interpret \ntheir own lives merely in terms of a task assigned to them but also in terms of the taskmaster who \nhas assigned it to them. \n \nLogotherapy is neither teaching nor preaching. It is as far removed from logical reasoning as it is \nfrom moral exhortation. To put it figuratively, the role played by a logotherapist is that of an eye \nspecialist rather than that of a painter. A painter tries to convey to us a picture of the world as he \nsees it; an ophthalmologist tries to enable us to see the world as it really is. The logotherapist's role \nconsists of widening and broadening the visual field of the patient so that the whole spectrum of \npotential meaning becomes conscious and visible to him. \n \nBy declaring that man is responsible and must actualize the potential meaning of his life, I wish to \nstress that the true meaning of life is to be discovered in the world rather than within man or his \nown psyche, as though it were a closed system. I have termed this constitutive characteristic \"the \nself-transcendence of human existence.\" It denotes the fact that being human always points, and is \ndirected, to something, or someone, other than oneself—be it a meaning to fulfil or another human \nbeing to encounter. The more one forgets himself—by giving himself to a cause to serve or another \nperson to love—the more human he is and the more he actualizes himself. What is called self-\nactualization is not an attainable aim at all, for the simple reason that the more one would strive for \nit, the more he would miss it. In other words, self-actualization is possible only as a side-effect of \nself-transcendence. \n \nThus far we have shown that the meaning of life always changes, but that it never ceases to be. \nAccording to logotherapy, we can discover this meaning in life in three different ways: (1) by creating \na work or doing a deed; (2) by experiencing something or encountering someone; and (3) by the \nattitude we take toward unavoidable suffering. The first, the way of achievement or \naccomplishment, is quite obvious. The second and third need further elaboration. \n \nThe second way of finding a meaning in life is by experiencing something—such as goodness, truth \nand beauty —by experiencing nature and culture or, last but not least, by experiencing another \nhuman being in his very uniqueness;—by loving him.\n\f\nTHE MEANING OF LOVE \nLove is the only way to grasp another human being in the innermost core of his personality. No one \ncan become fully aware of the very essence of another human being unless he loves him. By his love \nhe is enabled to see the essential traits and features in the beloved person; and even more, he sees \nthat which is potential in him, which is not yet actualized but yet ought to be actualized. \nFurthermore, by his love, the loving person enables the beloved person to actualize these \npotentialities. By making him aware of what he can be and of what he should become, he makes \nthese potentialities come true. \n \nIn logotherapy, love is not interpreted as a mere epiphenomenon3 of sexual drives and instincts in \nthe sense of a so-called sublimation. Love is as primary a phenomenon as sex. Normally, sex is a \nmode of expression for love. Sex is justified, even sanctified, as soon as, but only as long as, it is a \nvehicle of love. Thus love is not understood as a mere side-effect of sex; rather, sex is a way of \nexpressing the experience of that ultimate togetherness which is called love. \n \nThe third way of finding a meaning in life is by suffering. \n \n3 A phenomenon that occurs as the result of a primary phenomenon. \n \nTHE MEANING OF SUFFERING \nWe must never forget that we may also find meaning in life even when confronted with a hopeless \nsituation, when facing a fate that cannot be changed. For what then matters is to bear witness to the \nuniquely human potential at its best, which is to transform a personal tragedy into a triumph, to turn \none's predicament into a human achievement. When we are no longer able to change a situation— \njust think of an incurable disease such as inoperable cancer —we are challenged to change \nourselves. \n \nLet me cite a clear-cut example: Once, an elderly general practitioner consulted me because of his \nsevere depression. He could not overcome the loss of his wife who had died two years before and \nwhom he had loved above all else. Now, how could I help him? What should I tell him? Well, I \nrefrained from telling him anything but instead confronted him with the question, \"What would \nhave happened, Doctor, if you had died first, and your wife would have had to survive you?\" \"Oh,\" \nhe said, \"for her this would have been terrible; how she would have suffered!\" Whereupon I replied, \n\"You see, Doctor, such a suffering has been spared her, and it was you who have spared her this \nsuffering—to be sure, at the price that now you have to survive and mourn her.\" He said no word \nbut shook my hand and calmly left my office. In some way, suffering ceases to be suffering at the \nmoment it finds a meaning, such as the meaning of a sacrifice. \n \nOf course, this was no therapy in the proper sense since, first, his despair was no disease; and \nsecond, I could not change his fate; I could not revive his wife. But in that moment I did succeed in \nchanging his attitude toward his unalterable fate inasmuch as from that time on he could at least see \na meaning in his suffering. It is one of the basic tenets of logotherapy that man's main concern is not \nto gain pleasure or to avoid pain but rather to see a meaning in his life. That is why man is even \nready to suffer, on the condition, to be sure, that his suffering has a meaning. \n \nBut let me make it perfectly clear that in no way is suffering necessary to find meaning. I only insist \nthat meaning is possible even in spite of suffering—provided, certainly, that the suffering is \nunavoidable. If it were avoidable, however, the meaningful thing to do would be to remove its cause, \nbe it psychological, biological or political. To suffer unnecessarily is masochistic rather than heroic.\n\f\nEdith Weisskopf-Joelson, before her death professor of psychology at the University of Georgia, \ncontended, in her article on logotherapy, that \"our current mental-hygiene philosophy stresses the \nidea that people ought to be happy, that unhappiness is a symptom of maladjustment. Such a value \nsystem might be responsible for the fact that the burden of unavoidable unhappiness is increased by \nunhappiness about being unhappy.\"4 And in another paper she expressed the hope that logotherapy \n\"may help counteract certain unhealthy trends in the present-day culture of the United States, \nwhere the incurable sufferer is given very little opportunity to be proud of his suffering and to \nconsider it ennobling rather than degrading\" so that \"he is not only unhappy, but also ashamed of \nbeing unhappy.\"5 \n \nThere are situations in which one is cut off from the opportunity to do one's work or to enjoy one's \nlife; but what never can be ruled out is the unavoidability of suffering. In accepting this challenge to \nsuffer bravely, life has a meaning up to the last moment, and it retains this meaning literally to the \nend. In other words, life's meaning is an unconditional one, for it even includes the potential \nmeaning of unavoidable suffering. \n \nLet me recall that which was perhaps the deepest experience I had in the concentration camp. The \nodds of surviving the camp were no more than one in twenty-eight, as can easily be verified by exact \nstatistics. It did not even seem possible, let alone probable, that the manuscript of my first book, \nwhich I had hidden in my coat when I arrived at Auschwitz, would ever be rescued. Thus, I had to \nundergo and to overcome the loss of my mental child. And now it seemed as if nothing and no one \nwould survive me; neither a physical nor a mental child of my own! So I found myself confronted \nwith the question whether under such circumstances my life was ultimately void of any meaning. \n \n4 \"Some Comments on a Viennese School of Psychiatry,\" The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 51 (1955), pp. \n701-3. \n \n5 \"Logotherapy and Existential Analysis,\" Ada Psychotherapeutica,6 (1958), pp.193-204. \n \nNot yet did I notice that an answer to this question with which I was wrestling so passionately was \nalready in store for me, and that soon thereafter this answer would be given to me. This was the \ncase when I had to surrender my clothes and in turn inherited the worn-out rags of an inmate who \nhad already been sent to the gas chamber immediately after his arrival at the Auschwitz railway \nstation. Instead of the many pages of my manuscript, I found in a pocket of the newly acquired coat \none single page torn out of a Hebrew prayer book, containing the most important Jewish prayer, \nShema Yisrael. How should I have interpreted such a \"coincidence\" other than as a challenge to live \nmy thoughts instead of merely putting them on paper? \n \nA bit later, I remember, it seemed to me that I would die in the near future. In this critical situation, \nhowever, my concern was different from that of most of my comrades. Their question was, \"Will we \nsurvive the camp? For, if not, all this suffering has no meaning.\" The question which beset me was, \n\"Has all this suffering, this dying around us, a meaning? For, if not, then ultimately there is no \nmeaning to survival; for a life whose meaning depends upon such a happenstance—as whether one \nescapes or not—ultimately would not be worth living at all.\" \n \nMETA-CLINICAL PROBLEMS \nMore and more, a psychiatrist is approached today by patients who confront him with human \nproblems rather than neurotic symptoms. Some of the people who nowadays call on a psychiatrist \nwould have seen a pastor, priest or rabbi in former days. Now they often refuse to be handed over \nto a clergyman and instead confront the doctor with questions such as, \"What is the meaning of my \nlife?\"\n\f\nA  LOGODRAMA \nI should like to cite the following instance: Once, the mother of a boy who had died at the age of \neleven years was admitted to my hospital department after a suicide attempt. Dr. Kurt Kocourek \ninvited her to join a therapeutic group, and it happened that I stepped into the room where he was \nconducting a psychodrama. She was telling her story. At the death of her boy she was left alone with \nanother, older son, who was crippled, suffering from the effects of infantile paralysis. The poor boy \nhad to be moved around in a wheelchair. His mother, however, rebelled against her fate. But when \nshe tried to commit suicide together with him, it was the crippled son who prevented her from doing \nso; he liked living! For him, life had remained meaningful. Why was it not so for his mother? How \ncould her life still have a meaning? And how could we help her to become aware of it? \n \nImprovising, I participated in the discussion, and questioned another woman in the group. I asked \nher how old she was and she answered, \"Thirty.\" I replied, \"No, you are not thirty but instead eighty \nand lying on your deathbed. And now you are looking back on your life, a life which was childless but \nfull of financial success and social prestige.\" And then I invited her to imagine what she would feel in \nthis situation. \"What will you think of it? What will you say to yourself?\" Let me quote what she \nactually said from a tape which was recorded during that session. \"Oh, I married a millionaire, I had \nan easy life full of wealth, and I lived it up! I flirted with men; I teased them! But now I am eighty; I \nhave no children of my own. Looking back as an old woman, I cannot see what all that was for; \nactually, I must say, my life was a failure!\" \n \nI then invited the mother of the handicapped son to imagine herself similarly looking back over her \nlife. Let us listen to what she had to say as recorded on the tape: \"I wished to have children and this \nwish has been granted to me; one boy died; the other, however, the crippled one, would have been \nsent to an institution if I had not taken over his care. Though he is crippled and helpless, he is after \nall my boy. And so I have made a fuller life possible for him; I have made a better human being out of \nmy son.\" At this moment, there was an outburst of tears and, crying, she continued: \"As for myself, I \ncan look back peacefully on my life; for I can say my life was full of meaning, and I have tried hard to \nfulfil it; I have done my best—I have done the best for my son. My life was no failure!\" Viewing her \nlife as if from her deathbed, she had suddenly been able to see a meaning in it, a meaning which \neven included all of her sufferings. By the same token, however, it had become clear as well that a \nlife of short duration, like that, for example, of her dead boy, could be so rich in joy and love that it \ncould contain more meaning than a life lasting eighty years. \n \nAfter a while I proceeded to another question, this time addressing myself to the whole group. The \nquestion was whether an ape which was being used to develop poliomyelitis serum, and for this \nreason punctured again and again, would ever be able to grasp the meaning of its suffering. \nUnanimously, the group replied that of course it would not; with its limited intelligence, it could not \nenter into the world of man, i.e., the only world in which the meaning of its suffering would be \nunderstandable. Then I pushed forward with the following question: \"And what about man? Are you \nsure that the human world is a terminal point in the evolution of the cosmos? Is it not conceivable \nthat there is still another dimension, a world beyond man's world; a world in which the question of \nan ultimate meaning of human suffering would find an answer?\" \n \nTHE SUPER-MEANING \nThis ultimate meaning necessarily exceeds and surpasses the finite intellectual capacities of man; in \nlogotherapy, we speak in this context of a super-meaning. What is demanded of man is not, as some \nexistential philosophers teach, to endure the meaninglessness of life, but rather to bear his \nincapacity to grasp its unconditional meaningfulness in rational terms. Logos is deeper than logic.\n\f\nA psychiatrist who goes beyond the concept of the super-meaning will sooner or later be \nembarrassed by his patients, just as I was when my daughter at about six years of age asked me the \nquestion, \"Why do we speak of the good Lord?\" Whereupon I said, \"Some weeks ago, you were \nsuffering from measles, and then the good Lord sent you full recovery.\" However, the little girl was \nnot content; she retorted, \"Well, but please, Daddy, do not forget: in the first place, he had sent me \nthe measles.\" \n \nHowever, when a patient stands on the firm ground of religious belief, there can be no objection to \nmaking use of the therapeutic effect of his religious convictions and thereby drawing upon his \nspiritual resources. In order to do so, the psychiatrist may put himself in the place of the patient. \nThat is exactly what I did once, for instance, when a rabbi from Eastern Europe turned to me and \ntold me his story. He had lost his first wife and their six children in the concentration camp of \nAuschwitz where they were gassed, and now it turned out that his second wife was sterile. I \nobserved that procreation is not the only meaning of life, for then life in itself would become \nmeaningless, and something which in itself is meaningless cannot be rendered meaningful merely by \nits perpetuation. However, the rabbi evaluated his plight as an orthodox Jew in terms of despair that \nthere was no son of his own who would ever say Kaddish6 for him after his death. \n \n6 A prayer for the dead. \n \nBut I would not give up. I made a last attempt to help him by inquiring whether he did not hope to \nsee his children again in Heaven. However, my question was followed by an outburst of tears, and \nnow the true reason for his despair came to the fore: he explained that his children, since they died \nas innocent martyrs,7 were thus found worthy of the highest place in Heaven, but as for himself he \ncould not expect, as an old, sinful man, to be assigned the same place. I did not give up but retorted, \n\"Is it not conceivable, Rabbi, that precisely this was the meaning of your surviving your children: that \nyou may be purified through these years of suffering, so that finally you, too, though not innocent \nlike your children, may become worthy of joining them in Heaven? Is it not written in the Psalms that \nGod preserves all your tears?8 So perhaps none of your sufferings were in vain.\" For the first time in \nmany years he found relief from his suffering through the new point of view which I was able to \nopen up to him. \n \n7 L'kiddush basbem, i.e., for the sanctification of God's name. \n \n8 \"Thou hast kept count of my tossings; put thou my tears in thy bottle! Are they not in thy book?\" (Ps. 56, 8.) \n \nLIFE'S TRANSITORINESS \nThose things which seem to take meaning away from human life include not only suffering but dying \nas well. I never tire of saying that the only really transitory aspects of life are the potentialities; but \nas soon as they are actualized, they are rendered realities at that very moment; they are saved and \ndelivered into the past, wherein they are rescued and preserved from transitoriness. For, in the past, \nnothing is irretrievably lost but everything irrevocably stored. \n \nThus, the transitoriness of our existence in no way makes it meaningless. But it does constitute our \nresponsibleness; for everything hinges upon our realizing the essentially transitory possibilities. Man \nconstantly makes his choice concerning the mass of present potentialities; which of these will be \ncondemned to nonbeing and which will be actualized? Which choice will be made an actuality once \nand forever, an immortal \"footprint in the sands of time\"? At any moment, man must decide, for \nbetter or for worse, what will be the monument of his existence. \n \nUsually, to be sure, man considers only the stubble field of transitoriness and overlooks the full \ngranaries of the past, wherein he had salvaged once and for all his deeds, his joys and also his\n\f\nsufferings. Nothing can be undone, and nothing can be done away with. I should say having been is \nthe surest kind of being. \n \nLogotherapy, keeping in mind the essential transitoriness ,, of human existence, is not pessimistic \nbut rather activistic. To express this point figuratively we might say: The pessimist resembles a man \nwho observes with fear and sadness that his wall calendar, from which he daily tears a sheet, grows \nthinner with each passing day. On the other hand, the person who attacks the problems of life \nactively is like a man who removes each successive leaf from his calendar and files it neatly and \ncarefully away with its predecessors, after first having jotted down a few diary notes on the back. He \ncan reflect with pride and joy on all the richness set down in these notes, on all the life he has \nalready lived to the fullest. What will it matter to him if he notices that he is growing old? Has he any \nreason to envy the young people whom he sees, or wax nostalgic over his own lost youth? What \nreasons has he to envy a young person? For the possibilities that a young person has, the future \nwhich is in store for him? \"No, thank you,\" he will think. \"Instead of possibilities, I have realities in \nmy past, not only the reality of work done and of love loved, but of sufferings bravely suffered. \nThese sufferings are even the things of which I am most proud, though these are things which \ncannot inspire envy.\" \n \nLOGOTHERAPY AS A TECHNIQUE \nA realistic fear, like the fear of death, cannot be tranquilized away by its psychodynamic \ninterpretation; on the other hand, a neurotic fear, such as agoraphobia, cannot be cured by \nphilosophical understanding. However, logotherapy has developed a special technique to handle \nsuch cases, too. To understand what is going on whenever this technique is used, we take as a \nstarting point a condition which is frequently observed in neurotic individuals, namely, anticipatory \nanxiety. It is characteristic of this fear that it produces precisely that of which the patient is afraid. \nAn individual, for example, who is afraid of blushing when he enters a large room and faces many \npeople will actually be more prone to blush under these circumstances. In this context, one might \namend the saying \"The wish is father to the thought\" to \"The fear is mother of the event.\" \n \nIronically enough, in the same way that fear brings to pass what one is afraid of, likewise a forced \nintention makes impossible what one forcibly wishes. This excessive intention, or \"hyper-intention,\" \nas I call it, can be observed particularly in cases of sexual neurosis. The more a man tries to \ndemonstrate his sexual potency or a woman her ability to experience orgasm, the less they are able \nto succeed. Pleasure is, and must remain, a side-effect or by-product, and is destroyed and spoiled \nto the degree to which it is made a goal in itself. \n \nIn addition to excessive intention as described above, excessive attention, or \"hyper-reflection,\" as it \nis called in logotherapy, may also be pathogenic (that is, lead to sickness). The following clinical \nreport will indicate what I mean: A young woman came to me complaining of being frigid. The case \nhistory showed that in her childhood she had been sexually abused by her father. However, it had \nnot been this traumatic experience in itself which had eventuated in her sexual neurosis, as could \neasily be evidenced. For it turned out that, through reading popular psychoanalytic literature, the \npatient had lived constantly with the fearful expectation of the toll which her traumatic experience \nwould someday take. This anticipatory anxiety resulted both in excessive intention to confirm her \nfemininity and excessive attention cantered upon herself rather than upon her partner. This was \nenough to incapacitate the patient for the peak experience of sexual pleasure, since the orgasm was \nmade an object of intention, and an object of attention as well, instead of remaining an unintended \neffect of unreflected dedication and surrender to the partner. After undergoing short-term \nlogotherapy, the patient's excessive attention and intention of her ability to experience orgasm had \nbeen \"dereflected,\" to introduce another logo-therapeutic term. When her attention was refocused \ntoward the proper object, i.e., the partner, orgasm established itself spontaneously.9\n\f\n9 In order to treat cases of sexual impotence, a specific logotherapeutic technique has been developed, based on the \ntheory of hyper-intention and hyper-reflection as sketched above (Viktor E. Frankl, \"The Pleasure Principle and Sexual \nNeurosis,\" The International Journal of Sexology, Vol. 5, No. 3 [1952], pp. 128-30). Of course, this cannot be dealt with in \nthis brief presentation of the principles of logotherapy.  \n \nLogotherapy bases its technique called \"paradoxical intention\" on the twofold fact that fear brings \nabout that which one is afraid of, and that hyper-intention makes impossible what one wishes. In \nGerman I described paradoxical intention as early as 1939.10 In this approach the phobic patient is \ninvited to intend, even if only for a moment, precisely that which he fears. \n \n10 Viktor E. Frankl, \"Zur medikamentosen Unterstiitzung der Psy-chotherapie bei Neurosen,\" Schweizer Archiv fur \nNeurologie und Psychiatrie, Vol. 43, pp. 26-31. \n \nLet me recall a case. A young physician consulted me because of his fear of perspiring. Whenever he \nexpected an outbreak of perspiration, this anticipatory anxiety was enough to precipitate excessive \nsweating. In order to cut this circle formation I advised the patient, in the event that sweating should \nrecur, to resolve deliberately to show people how much he could sweat. A week later he returned to \nreport that whenever he met anyone who triggered his anticipatory anxiety, he said to himself, \"I \nonly sweated out a quart before, but now I'm going to pour at least ten quarts!\" The result was that, \nafter suffering from his phobia for four years, he was able, after a single session, to free himself \npermanently of it within one week. \n \nThe reader will note that this procedure consists of a reversal of the patient's attitude, inasmuch as \nhis fear is replaced by a paradoxical wish. By this treatment, the wind is taken out of the sails of the \nanxiety. \n \nSuch a procedure, however, must make use of the specifically human capacity for self-detachment \ninherent in a sense of humour. This basic capacity to detach one from oneself is actualized whenever \nthe logotherapeutic technique called paradoxical intention is applied. At the same time, the patient \nis enabled to put himself at a distance from his own neurosis. A statement consistent with this is \nfound in Gordon W. Allport's book, The Individual and His Religion: \"The neurotic who learns to \nlaugh at himself may be on the way to self-management, perhaps to cure.\"11 \n \n11 New York, The Macmillan Co., 1956, p. 92. \n \nParadoxical intention is the empirical validation and clinical application of Allport's statement. \nA few more case reports may serve to clarify this method further. The following patient was a \nbookkeeper who had been treated by many doctors and in several clinics without any therapeutic \nsuccess. When he was admitted to my hospital department, he was in extreme despair, confessing \nthat he was close to suicide. For some years, he had suffered from a writer's cramp which had \nrecently become so severe that he was in danger of losing his job. Therefore, only immediate short-\nterm therapy could alleviate the situation. In starting treatment, Dr. Eva Kozdera recommended to \nthe patient that he do just the opposite of what he usually had done; namely, instead of trying to \nwrite as neatly and legibly as possible, to write with the worst possible scrawl. He was advised to say \nto himself, \"Now I will show people what a good scribbler I am!\" And at the moment in which he \ndeliberately tried to scribble, he was unable to do so. \"I tried to scrawl but simply could not do it,\" he \nsaid the next day. Within forty-eight hours the patient was in this way freed from his writer's cramp, \nand remained free for the observation period after he had been treated. He is a happy man again \nand fully able to work. \n \nA similar case, dealing, however, with speaking rather than writing, was related to me by a colleague \nin the Laryngological Department of the Vienna Poliklinik Hospital. It was the most severe case of"

    "raw_text": "stuttering he had come across in his many years of practice. Never in his life, as far as the stutterer \ncould remember, had he been free from his speech trouble, even for a moment, except once. This \nhappened when he was twelve years old and had hooked a ride on a streetcar. When caught by the \nconductor, he thought that the only way to escape would be to elicit his sympathy, and so he tried \nto demonstrate that he was just a poor stuttering boy. At that moment, when he tried to stutter, he \nwas unable to do it. Without meaning to, he had practiced paradoxical intention, though not for \ntherapeutic purposes. \n \nHowever, this presentation should not leave the impression that paradoxical intention is effective \nonly in mono-symptomatic cases. By means of this logotherapeutic technique, my staff at the Vienna \nPoliklinik Hospital has succeeded in bringing relief even in obsessive-compulsive neuroses of a most \nsevere degree and duration. I refer, for instance, to a woman sixty-five years of age who had \nsuffered for sixty years from a washing compulsion. Dr. Eva Kozdera started logotherapeutic \ntreatment by means of paradoxical intention, and two months later the patient was able to lead a \nnormal life. Before admission to the Neurological Department of the Vienna Poliklinik Hospital, she \nhad confessed, \"Life was hell for me.\" Handicapped by her compulsion and bacteriophobic \nobsession, she finally remained in bed all day unable to do any housework. It would not be accurate \nto say that she is now completely free of symptoms, for an obsession may come to her mind. \nHowever, she is able to \"joke about it,\" as she says; in short, to apply paradoxical intention. \n \nParadoxical intention can also be applied in cases of sleep disturbance. The fear of sleeplessness12 \nresults in a hyper-intention to fall asleep, which, in turn, incapacitates the patient to do so. To \novercome this particular fear, I usually advise the patient not to try to sleep but rather to try to do \njust the opposite, that is, to stay awake as long as possible. In other words, the hyper-intention to \nfall asleep, arising from the anticipatory anxiety of not being able to do so, must be replaced by the \nparadoxical intention not to fall asleep, which soon will be followed by sleep. \n \n12 The fear of sleeplessness is, in the majority of cases, due to the patient's ignorance of the fact that the organism \nprovides itself by itself with the minimum amount of sleep really needed. \n \nParadoxical intention is no panacea. Yet it lends itself as a useful tool in treating obsessive-\ncompulsive and phobic conditions, especially in cases with underlying anticipatory anxiety. \nMoreover, it is a short-term therapeutic device. However, one should not conclude that such a \nshort-term therapy necessarily results in only temporary therapeutic effects. One of \"the more \ncommon illusions of Freudian orthodoxy,\" to quote the late Emil A. Gutheil, \"is that the durability of \nresults corresponds to the length of therapy.\"13 In my files there is, for instance, the case report of a \npatient to whom paradoxical intention was administered more than twenty years ago; the \ntherapeutic effect proved to be, nevertheless, a permanent one. \n \n13 American Journal of Psychotherapy, 10 (1956), p. 134. \n \nOne of the most remarkable facts is that paradoxical intention is effective regardless of the \netiological basis of the case concerned. This confirms a statement once made by Edith Weisskopf-\nJoelson: \"Although traditional psychotherapy has insisted that therapeutic practices have to be \nbased on findings on etiology, it is possible that certain factors might cause neuroses during early \nchildhood and that entirely different factors might relieve neuroses during adulthood.\"14 \n \n14 \"Some Comments on a Viennese School of Psychiatry,\" The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 51 (1955), pp. \n701-3. \n \nAs for the actual causation of neuroses, apart from constitutional elements, whether somatic or \npsychic in nature, such feedback mechanisms as anticipatory anxiety seem to be a major pathogenic"

    "raw_text": "factor. A given symptom is responded to by a phobia, the phobia triggers the symptom, and the \nsymptom, in turn, reinforces the phobia. A similar chain of events, however, can be observed in \nobsessive-compulsive cases in which the patient fights the ideas which haunt him15 Thereby, \nhowever, he increases their power to disturb him, since pressure precipitates counter pressure. \nAgain the symptom is reinforced! On the other hand, as soon as the patient stops fighting his \nobsessions and instead tries to ridicule them by dealing with them in an ironical way—by applying \nparadoxical intention—the vicious circle is cut, the symptom diminishes and finally atrophies. In the \nfortunate case where there is no existential vacuum which invites and elicits the symptom, the \npatient will not only succeed in ridiculing his neurotic fear but finally will succeed in completely \nignoring it. \n \n15 This is often motivated by the patient's fear that his obsessionsindicate an imminent or even actual psychosis; the \npatient is not aware of the empirical fact that an obsessive-compulsive neurosis is immunizing him against a formal \npsychosis rather than endangering him in this direction. \n \nAs we see, anticipatory anxiety has to be counteracted by paradoxical intention; hyper-intention as \nwell as hyper-reflection have to be counteracted by dereflection; dereflection, however, ultimately \nis not possible except by the patient's orientation toward his specific vocation and mission in life.16 \n \nIt is not the neurotic's self-concern, whether pity or contempt, which breaks the circle formation; the \ncue to cure is self-transcendence! \n \n16 This conviction is supported by Allport who once said, \"As the focus of striving shifts from the conflict to selfless goals, \nthe life as a whole becomes sounder even though the neurosis may never completely disappear\" (op. cit., p. 95). \n \nTHE COLLECTIVE NEUROSIS \nEvery age has its own collective neurosis, and every age needs its own psychotherapy to cope with \nit. The existential vacuum which is the mass neurosis of the present time can be described as a \nprivate and personal form of nihilism; for nihilism can be defined as the contention that being has no \nmeaning. As for psychotherapy, however, it will never be able to cope with this state of affairs on a \nmass scale if it does not keep itself free from the impact and influence of the contemporary trends \nof a nihilistic philosophy; otherwise it represents a symptom of the mass neurosis rather than its \npossible cure. Psychotherapy would not only reflect a nihilistic philosophy but also, even though \nunwillingly and unwittingly, transmit to the patient what is actually a caricature rather than a true \npicture of man. \n \nFirst of all, there is a danger inherent in the teaching of man's \"nothingbutness,\" the theory that man \nis nothing but the result of biological, psychological and sociological conditions, or the product of \nheredity and environment. Such a view of man makes a neurotic believe what he is prone to believe \nanyway, namely, that he is the pawn and victim of outer influences or inner circumstances. This \nneurotic fatalism is fostered and strengthened by a psychotherapy which denies that man is free. \nTo be sure, a human being is a finite thing, and his freedom is restricted. It is not freedom from \nconditions, but it is freedom to take a stand toward the conditions. As I once put it: \"As a professor \nin two fields, neurology and psychiatry, I am fully aware of the extent to which man is subject to \nbiological, psychological and sociological conditions. But in addition to being a professor in two fields \nI am a survivor of four camps—concentration camps, that is— and as such I also bear witness to the \nunexpected extent to which man is capable of defying and braving even the worst conditions \nconceivable.\"17 \n  \n17  \"Value Dimensions in Teaching,\" a colour television film produced by Hollywood Animators, Inc., for the California \nJunior College Association."

    "raw_text": "CRITIQUE OF PAN-DETERMINISM \nPsychoanalysis has often been blamed for its so-called pan-sexualism. I, for one, doubt whether this \nreproach has ever been legitimate. However, there is something which seems to me to be an even \nmore erroneous and dangerous assumption, namely, that which I call \"pan-determinism.\" By that I \nmean the view of man which disregards his capacity to take a stand toward any conditions \nwhatsoever. Man is not fully conditioned and determined but rather determines himself whether he \ngives in to conditions or stands up to them. In other words, man is ultimately self-determining. Man \ndoes not simply exist but always decides what his existence will be, what he will become in the next \nmoment. \n \nBy the same token, every human being has the freedom to change at any instant. Therefore, we can \npredict his future only within the large framework of a statistical survey referring to a whole group; \nthe individual personality, however, remains essentially unpredictable. The basis for any predictions \nwould be represented by biological, psychological or sociological conditions. Yet one of the main \nfeatures of human existence is the capacity to rise above such conditions, to grow beyond them. \nMan is capable of changing the world for the better if possible, and of changing himself for the \nbetter if necessary. \n \nLet me cite the case of Dr. J. He was the only man I ever encountered in my whole life whom I would \ndare to call a Mephistophelean being, a satanic figure. At that time he was generally called \"the mass \nmurderer of Steinhof\" (the large mental hospital in Vienna). When the Nazis started their euthanasia \nprogram, he held all the strings in his hands and was so fanatic in the job assigned to him that he \ntried not to let one single psychotic individual escape the gas chamber. After the war, when I came \nback to Vienna, I asked what had happened to Dr. J. \"He had been imprisoned by the Russians in one \nof the isolation cells of Steinhof,\" they told me. \"The next day, however, the door of his cell stood \nopen and Dr. J. was never seen again.\" \n \nLater I was convinced that, like others, he had with the help of his comrades made his way to South \nAmerica. More recently, however, I was consulted by a former Austrian diplomat who had been \nimprisoned behind the Iron Curtain for many years, first in Siberia and then in the famous Lubianka \nprison in Moscow. While I was examining him neurologically, he suddenly asked me whether I \nhappened to know Dr. J. After my affirmative reply he continued: \"I made his acquaintance in \nLubianka. There he died, at about the age of forty, from cancer of the urinary bladder. Before he \ndied, however, he showed himself to be the best comrade you can imagine! He gave consolation to \neverybody. He lived up to the highest conceivable moral standard. He was the best friend I ever met \nduring my long years in prison!\" \n \nThis is the story of Dr. J., \"the mass murderer of Steinhof.\" How can we dare to predict the behaviour \nof man? We may predict the movements of a machine, of an automaton; more than this, we may \neven try to predict the mechanisms or \"dynamisms\" of the human psyche as well. But man is more \nthan psyche. \n \nFreedom, however, is not the last word. Freedom is only part of the story and half of the truth. \nFreedom is but the negative aspect of the whole phenomenon whose positive aspect is \nresponsibleness. In fact, freedom is in danger of degenerating into mere arbitrariness unless it is \nlived in terms of responsibleness. That is why / recommend that the Statue of Liberty on the East \nCoast be supplemented by a Statue of Responsibility on the West Coast.\n\f\nTHE PSYCHIATRIC CREDO \nThere is nothing conceivable which would so condition a man as to leave him without the slightest \nfreedom. Therefore, a residue of freedom, however limited it may be, is left to man in neurotic and \neven psychotic cases. Indeed, the innermost core of the patient's personality is not even touched by \na psychosis. \n \nAn incurably psychotic individual may lose his usefulness but yet retain the dignity of a human being. \nThis is my psychiatric credo. Without it I should not think it worthwhile to be a psychiatrist. For \nwhose sake? Just for the sake of a damaged brain machine which cannot be repaired? If the patient \nwere not definitely more, euthanasia would be justified. \n \nPSYCHIATRY REHUMANIZED \nFor too long a time—for half a century, in fact—psychiatry tried to interpret the human mind merely \nas a mechanism, and consequently the therapy of mental disease merely in terms of a technique. I \nbelieve this dream has been dreamt out. What now begins to loom on the horizon are not the \nsketches of a psychologised medicine but rather those of a humanized psychiatry. \n \nA doctor, however, who would still interpret his own role mainly as that of a technician would \nconfess that he sees in his patient nothing more than a machine, instead of seeing the human being \nbehind the disease! \n \nA human being is not one thing among others; things determine each other, but man is ultimately \nself-determining. What he becomes—within the limits of endowment and environment—he has \nmade out of himself. In the concentration camps, for example, in this living laboratory and on this \ntesting ground, we watched and witnessed some of our comrades behave like swine while others \nbehaved like saints. Man has both potentialities within himself; which one is actualized depends on \ndecisions but not on conditions. \n \nOur generation is realistic, for we have come to know man as he really is. After all, man is that being \nwho invented the gas chambers of Auschwitz; however, he is also that being who entered those gas \nchambers upright, with the Lord's Prayer or the Shema Yisrael on his lips.\n\f\nPOSTSCRIPT 1984 \n \nThe Case for a Tragic Optimism* \n \nDedicated to the memory of Edith Weisskopf-Joelson, whose pioneering efforts in logotherapy in the United States began \nas early as 1955 and whose contributions to the field have been invaluable. \n \n* This chapter is based on a lecture I presented at the Third World Congress of Logotherapy, Regensburg University, West \nGermany, June 1983. \n \nLET US FIRST ASK OURSELVES WHAT SHOULD BE understood by \"a tragic optimism.\" In brief it means that \none is, and remains, optimistic in spite of the \"tragic triad,\" as it is called in logotherapy, a triad \nwhich consists of those aspects of human existence which may be circumscribed by: (1) pain; (2) \nguilt; and (3) death. This chapter, in fact, raises the question, How is it possible to say yes to life in \nspite of all that? How, to pose the question differently, can life retain its potential meaning in spite \nof its tragic aspects? After all, \"saying yes to life in spite of everything,\" to use the phrase in which \nthe title of a German book of mine is couched, presupposes that life is potentially meaningful under \nany conditions, even those which are most miserable. And this in turn presupposes the human \ncapacity to creatively turn life's negative aspects into something positive or constructive. In other \nwords, what matters is to make the best of any given situation. \"The best,\" however, is that which in \nLatin is called optimum—hence the reason I speak of a tragic optimism, that is, an optimism in the \nface of tragedy and in view of the human potential which at its best always allows for: (1) turning \nsuffering into a human achievement and accomplishment; (2) deriving from guilt the opportunity to \nchange oneself for the better; and (3) deriving from life's transitoriness an incentive to take \nresponsible action. \n \nIt must be kept in mind, however, that optimism is not anything to be commanded or ordered. One \ncannot even force oneself to be optimistic indiscriminately, against all odds, against all hope. And \nwhat is true for hope is also true for the other two components of the triad inasmuch as faith and \nlove cannot be commanded or ordered either. \n \nTo the European, it is a characteristic of the American culture that, again and again, one is \ncommanded and ordered to \"be happy.\" But happiness cannot be pursued; it must ensue. One must \nhave a reason to \"be happy.\" Once the reason is found, however, one becomes happy automatically. \nAs we see, a human being is not one in pursuit of happiness but rather in search of a reason to \nbecome happy, last but not least, through actualizing the potential meaning inherent and dormant \nin a given situation. \n \nThis need for a reason is similar in another specifically human phenomenon—laughter. If you want \nanyone to laugh you have to provide him with a reason, e.g., you have to tell him a joke. In no way is \nit possible to evoke real laughter by urging him, or having him urge himself, to laugh. Doing so would \nbe the same as urging people posed in front of a camera to say \"cheese,\" only to find that in the \nfinished photographs their faces are frozen in artificial smiles. \n \nIn logotherapy, such a behaviour pattern is called \"hyper-intention.\" It plays an important role in the \ncausation of sexual neurosis, be it frigidity or impotence. The more a patient, instead of forgetting \nhimself through giving himself, directly strives for orgasm, i.e., sexual pleasure, the more this pursuit \nof sexual pleasure becomes self-defeating. Indeed, what is called \"the pleasure principle\" is, rather, a \nfun-spoiler.\n\f\nOnce an individual's search for a meaning is successful, it not only renders him happy but also gives \nhim the capability to cope with suffering. And what happens if one's groping for a meaning has been \nin vain? This may well result in a fatal condition. Let us recall, for instance, what sometimes \nhappened in extreme situations such as prisoner-of-war camps or concentration camps. In the first, \nas I was told by American soldiers, a behaviour pattern crystallized to which they referred as \"give-\nup-itis.\" In the concentration camps, this behaviour was paralleled by those who one morning, at \nfive, refused to get up and go to work and instead stayed in the hut, on the straw wet with urine and \nfaeces. Nothing—neither warnings nor threats—could induce them to change their minds. And then \nsomething typical occurred: they took out a cigarette from deep down in a pocket where they had \nhidden it and started smoking. At that moment we knew that for the next forty-eight hours or so we \nwould watch them dying. Meaning orientation had subsided, and consequently the seeking of \nimmediate pleasure had taken over. \n \nIs this not reminiscent of another parallel, a parallel that confronts us day by day? I think of those \nyoungsters who, on a worldwide scale, refer to themselves as the \"no future\" generation. To be \nsure, it is not just a cigarette to which they resort; it is drugs. \n \nIn fact, the drug scene is one aspect of a more general mass phenomenon, namely the feeling of \nmeaninglessness resulting from a frustration of our existential needs which in turn has become a \nuniversal phenomenon in our industrial societies. Today it is not only logotherapists who claim that \nthe feeling of meaninglessness plays an ever increasing role in the etiology of neurosis. As Irvin D. \nYalom of Stanford University states in Existential Psychotherapy: \"Of forty consecutive patients \napplying for therapy at a psychiatric outpatient clinic . . . twelve (30 percent) had some major \nproblem involving meaning (as adjudged from self-ratings, therapists, or independent judges).\"1 \nThousands of miles east of Palo Alto, the situation differs only by 1 percent; the most recent \npertinent statistics indicate that in Vienna, 29 percent of the population complain that meaning is \nmissing from their lives. \n \n1 Basic Books, New York, 1980, p. 448. \n \nAs to the causation of the feeling of meaninglessness, one may say, albeit in an oversimplifying vein, \nthat people have enough to live by but nothing to live for; they have the means but no meaning. To \nbe sure, some do not even have the means. In particular, I think of the mass of people who are today \nunemployed. Fifty years ago, I published a study2 devoted to a specific type of depression I had \ndiagnosed in cases of young patients suffering from what I called \"unemployment neurosis.\" And I \ncould show that this neurosis really originated in a twofold erroneous identification: being jobless \nwas equated with being useless, and being useless was equated with having a meaningless life. \nConsequently, whenever I succeeded in persuading the patients to volunteer in youth organizations, \nadult education, public libraries and the like—in other words, as soon as they could fill their \nabundant free time with some sort of unpaid but meaningful activity—their depression disappeared \nalthough their economic situation had not changed and their hunger was the same. The truth is that \nman does not live by welfare alone. \n \n2 \"Wirtschaftskrise und Seelenleben vom Standpunkt des Jugend-beraters,\" Sozialdrztliche Rundschau, Vol. 4 (1933), pp. \n43-46. \n \nAlong with unemployment neurosis, which is triggered by an individual's socioeconomic situation, \nthere are other types of depression which are traceable back to psychodynamic or biochemical \nconditions, whichever the case may be. Accordingly, psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy are \nindicated respectively. Insofar as the feeling of meaninglessness is concerned, however, we should \nnot overlook and forget that, per se, it is not a matter of pathology; rather than being the sign and \nsymptom of a neurosis, it is, I would say, the proof of one's humanness. But although it is not caused\n\f\nby anything pathological, it may well cause a pathological reaction; in other words, it is potentially \npathogenic. Just consider the mass neurotic syndrome so pervasive in the young generation: there is \nample empirical evidence that the three facets of this syndrome—depression, aggression, \naddiction—are due to what is called in logo-therapy \"the existential vacuum,\" a feeling of emptiness \nand meaninglessness. \n \nIt goes without saying that not each and every case of depression is to be traced back to a feeling of \nmeaninglessness, nor does suicide—in which depression sometimes eventuates—always result from \nan existential vacuum. But even if each and every case of suicide had not been undertaken out of a \nfeeling of meaninglessness, it may well be that an individual's impulse to take his life would have \nbeen overcome had he been aware of some meaning and purpose worth living for. \n \nIf, thus, a strong meaning orientation plays a decisive role in the prevention of suicide, what about \nintervention in cases in which there is a suicide risk? As a young doctor I spent four years in Austria's \nlargest state hospital where I was in charge of the pavilion in which severely depressed patients \nwere accommodated—most of them having been admitted after a suicide attempt. I once calculated \nthat I must have explored twelve thousand patients during those four years. What accumulated was \nquite a store of experience from which I still draw whenever I am confronted with someone who is \nprone to suicide. I explain to such a person that patients have repeatedly told me how happy they \nwere that the suicide attempt had not been successful; weeks, months, years later, they told me, it \nturned out that there was a solution to their problem, an answer to their question, a meaning to \ntheir life. \"Even if things only take such a good turn in one of a thousand cases,\" my explanation \ncontinues, \"who can guarantee that in your case it will not happen one day, sooner or later? But in \nthe first place, you have to live to see the day on which it may happen, so you have to survive in \norder to see that day dawn, and from now on the responsibility for survival does not leave you.\" \n \nRegarding the second facet of the mass neurotic syndrome—aggression—let me cite an experiment \nonce conducted by Carolyn Wood Sherif. She had succeeded in artificially building up mutual \naggressions between groups of boy scouts, and observed that the aggressions only subsided when \nthe youngsters dedicated themselves to a collective purpose—that is, the joint task of dragging out \nof the mud a carriage in which food had to be brought to their camp. Immediately, they were not \nonly challenged but also united by a meaning they had to fulfil3 \n \n3 For further information on this experiment, see Viktor E. Frankl, The Unconscious God, New York, Simon and Schuster, \n1978, p. 140;and Viktor E. Frankl, The Unheard Cry for Meaning, New York, Simon and Schuster, 1978, p. 36. \n \nAs for the third issue, addiction, I am reminded of the findings presented by Annemarie von \nForstmeyer who noted that, as evidenced by tests and statistics, 90 percent of the alcoholics she \nstudied had suffered from an abysmal feeling of meaninglessness. Of the drug addicts studied by \nStanley Krippner, 100 percent believed that \"things seemed meaningless.\"4 \n \n4 For further information, see The Unconscious God, pp. 97-100; and The Unheard Cry for Meaning, pp. 26-28. \n \nNow let us turn to the question of meaning itself. To begin with, I would like to clarify that, in the \nfirst place, the logotherapist is concerned with the potential meaning inherent and dormant in all \nthe single situations one has to face throughout his or her life. Therefore, I will not be elaborating \nhere on the meaning of one's life as a whole, although I do not deny that such a long-range meaning \ndoes exist. To invoke an analogy, consider a movie: it consists of thousands upon thousands of \nindividual pictures, and each of them makes sense and carries a meaning, yet the meaning of the \nwhole film cannot be seen before its last sequence is shown. However, we cannot understand the \nwhole film without having first understood each of its components, each of the individual pictures. \nIsn't it the same with life? Doesn't the final meaning of life, too, reveal itself, if at all, only at its end,\n\f\non the verge of death? And doesn't this final meaning, too, depend on whether or not the potential \nmeaning of each single situation has been actualized to the best of the respective individual's \nknowledge and belief? \n \nThe fact remains that meaning, and its perception, as seen from the logotherapeutic angle, is \ncompletely down to earth rather than afloat in the air or resident in an ivory tower. Sweepingly, I \nwould locate the cognition of meaning —of the personal meaning of a concrete situation—midway \nbetween an \"aha\" experience along the lines of Karl Biihler's concept and a Gestalt perception, say, \nalong the lines of Max Wertheimer's theory. The perception of meaning differs from the classical \nconcept of Gestalt perception insofar as the latter implies the sudden awareness of a \"figure\" on a \n\"ground,\" whereas the perception of meaning, as I see it, more specifically boils down to becoming \naware of a possibility against the background of reality or, to express it in plain words, to becoming \naware of what can be done about a given situation. \n \nAnd how does a human being go about finding meaning? As Charlotte Buhler has stated: \"All we can \ndo is study the lives of people who seem to have found their answers to the questions of what \nultimately human life is about as against those who have not.\"5 In addition to such a biographical \napproach, however, we may as well embark on a biological approach. Logotherapy conceives of \nconscience as a prompter which, if need be, indicates the direction in which we have to move in a \ngiven life situation. In order to carry out such a task, conscience must apply a measuring stick to the \nsituation one is confronted with, and this situation has to be evaluated in the light of a set of criteria, \nin the light of a hierarchy of values. These values, however, cannot be espoused and adopted by us \non a conscious level—they are something that we are. They have crystallized in the course of the \nevolution of our species; they are founded on our biological past and are rooted in our biological \ndepth. Konrad Lorenz might have had something similar in mind when he developed the concept of \na biological a priori, and when both of us recently discussed my own view on the biological \nfoundation of the valuing process, he enthusiastically expressed his accord. In any case, if a pre-\nreflective axiological self-understanding exists, we may assume that it is ultimately anchored in our \nbiological heritage. \n \n5  \"Basic Theoretical Concepts of Humanistic Psychology,\" American Psychologist, XXVI (April 1971), p. 378. \n \nAs logotherapy teaches, there are three main avenues on which one arrives at meaning in life. The \nfirst is by creating a work or by doing a deed. The second is by experiencing something or \nencountering someone; in other words, meaning can be found not only in work but also in love. \nEdith Weisskopf-Joelson observed in this context that the logo-therapeutic \"notion that experiencing \ncan be as valuable as achieving is therapeutic because it compensates for our one-sided emphasis on \nthe external world of achievement at the expense of the internal world of experience.\"6 \n \n6 \"The Place of Logotherapy in the World Today,\" The International Forum for Logotherapy, Vol. 1, No. 3 (1980), pp. 3-7. \n \nMost important, however, is the third avenue to meaning in life: even the helpless victim of a \nhopeless situation, facing a fate he cannot change, may rise above himself, may grow beyond \nhimself, and by so doing change himself. He may turn a personal tragedy into a triumph. Again it was \nEdith Weisskopf-Joelson who, as mentioned on, once expressed the hope that logotherapy \"may \nhelp counteract certain unhealthy trends in the present-day culture of the United States, where the \nincurable sufferer is given very little opportunity to be proud of his suffering and to consider it \nennobling rather than degrading\" so that \"he is not only unhappy, but also ashamed of being \nunhappy.\" \n \nFor a quarter of a century I ran the neurological department of a general hospital and bore witness \nto my patients' capacity to turn their predicaments into human achievements. In addition to such\n\f\npractical experience, empirical evidence is also available which supports the possibility that one may \nfind meaning in suffering. Researchers at the Yale University School of Medicine \"have been \nimpressed by the number of prisoners of war of the Vietnam war who explicitly claimed that \nalthough their captivity was extraordinarily stressful—filled with torture, disease, malnutrition, and \nsolitary confinement—they nevertheless . . . benefited from the captivity experience, seeing it as a \ngrowth experience.\"7 \n \n7 W. H. Sledge, J. A. Boydstun and A. J. Rabe, \"Self-Concept Changes Related to War Captivity,\" Arch. Gen. Psychiatry, 37 \n(1980), pp. 430-443- \n \nBut the most powerful arguments in favour of \"a tragic optimism\" are those which in Latin are called \nargumenta ad hominem. Jerry Long, to cite an example, is a living testimony to \"the defiant power of \nthe human spirit,\" as it is called in logotherapy8 To quote the Texarkana Gazette, \"Jerry Long has \nbeen paralyzed from his neck down since a diving accident which rendered him a quadriplegic three \nyears ago. He was 17 when the accident occurred. Today Long can use his mouth stick to type. He \n'attends' two courses at Community College via a special telephone. The intercom allows Long to \nboth hear and participate in class discussions. He also occupies his time by reading, watching \ntelevision and writing.\" And in a letter I received from him, he writes: \"I view my life as being \nabundant with meaning and purpose. The attitude that I adopted on that fateful day has become my \npersonal credo for life: I broke my neck, it didn't break me. I am currently enrolled in my first \npsychology course in college. I believe that my handicap will only enhance my ability to help others. I \nknow that without the suffering, the growth that I have achieved would have been impossible.\" \n \n8 \"The Defiant Power of the Human Spirit\" was in fact the title of a paper presented by Long at the Third World Congress of \nLogotherapy in June 1983. \n \nIs this to say that suffering is indispensable to the discovery of meaning? In no way. I only insist that \nmeaning is available in spite of—nay, even through—suffering, provided, as noted in Part Two of this \nbook, that the suffering is unavoidable. If it is avoidable, the meaningful thing to do is to remove its \ncause, for unnecessary suffering is masochistic rather than heroic. If, on the other hand, one cannot \nchange a situation that causes his suffering, he can still choose his attitude9 Long had not chosen to \nbreak his neck, but he did decide not to let himself be broken by what had happened to him. \n \n9  I won't forget an interview I once heard on Austrian TV, given by a Polish cardiologist who, during World War II, had \nhelped organize the Warsaw ghetto upheaval. \"What a heroic deed,\" exclaimed the reporter. \"Listen,\" calmly replied the \ndoctor, \"to take a gun and shoot is no great thing; but if the SS leads you to a gas chamber or to a mass grave to execute \nyou on the spot, and you can't do anything about it—except for going your way with dignity—you see, this is what I would \ncall heroism.\" Attitudinal heroism, so to speak. \n \nAs we see, the priority stays with creatively changing the situation that causes us to suffer. But the \nsuperiority goes to the \"know-how to suffer,\" if need be. And there is empirical evidence that—\nliterally—the \"man in the street\" is of the same opinion. Austrian public-opinion pollsters recently \nreported that those held in highest esteem by most of the people interviewed are neither the great \nartists nor the great scientists, neither the great statesmen nor the great sports figures, but those \nwho master a hard lot with their heads held high. \n \nIn turning to the second aspect of the tragic triad, namely guilt, I would like to depart from a \ntheological concept that has always been fascinating to me. I refer to what is called mysterium \niniquitatis, meaning, as I see it, that a crime in the final analysis remains inexplicable inasmuch as it \ncannot be fully traced back to biological, psychological and/or sociological factors. Totally explaining \none's crime would be tantamount to explaining away his or her guilt and to seeing in him or her not \na free and responsible human being but a machine to be repaired. Even criminals themselves abhor \nthis treatment and prefer to be held responsible for their deeds. From a convict serving his sentence\n\f\nin an Illinois penitentiary I received a letter in which he deplored that \"the criminal never has a \nchance to explain himself. He is offered a variety of excuses to choose from. Society is blamed and in \nmany instances the blame is put on the victim.\" Furthermore, when I addressed the prisoners in San \nQuentin, I told them that \"you are human beings like me, and as such you were free to commit a \ncrime, to become guilty. Now, however, you are responsible for overcoming guilt by rising above it, \nby growing beyond yourselves, by changing for the better.\" They felt understood.10 And from Frank \nE.W., an ex-prisoner, I received a note which stated that he had \"started a logotherapy group for ex-\nfelons. We are 27 strong and the newer ones are staying out of prison through the peer strength of \nthose of us from the original group. Only one returned— and he is now free.\"11 \n \n10 See also Joseph B. Fabry, The Pursuit of Meaning, New York, Harper and Row, 1980. \n \n11 Cf. Viktor E. Frankl, The Unheard Cry for Meaning, New York, Simon and Schuster, 1978, pp. 42-43. \n \nAs for the concept of collective guilt, I personally think that it is totally unjustified to hold one person \nresponsible for the behaviour of another person or a collective of persons. Since the end of World \nWar II I have not become weary of publicly arguing against the collective guilt concept.12 Sometimes, \nhowever, it takes a lot of didactic tricks to detach people from their superstitions. An American \nwoman once confronted me with the reproach, \"How can you still write some of your books in \nGerman, Adolf Hitler's language?\" In response, I asked her if she had knives in her kitchen, and when \nshe answered that she did, I acted dismayed and shocked, exclaiming, \"How can you still use knives \nafter so many killers have used them to stab and murder their victims?\" She stopped objecting to my \nwriting books in German. \n \n12 See also Viktor E. Frankl, Psychotherapy and Existentialism, New York, Simon and Schuster, 1967. \n \nThe third aspect of the tragic triad concerns death. But it concerns life as well, for at any time each \nof the moments of which life consists is dying, and that moment will never recur. And yet is not this \ntransitoriness a reminder that challenges us to make the best possible use of each moment of our \nlives? It certainly is, and hence my imperative: Live as if you were living for the second time and had \nacted as wrongly the first time as you are about to act now. \n \nIn fact, the opportunities to act properly, the potentialities to fulfil a meaning, are affected by the \nirreversibility of our lives. But also the potentialities alone are so affected. For as soon as we have \nused an opportunity and have actualized a potential meaning, we have done so once and for all. We \nhave rescued it into the past wherein it has been safely delivered and deposited. In the past, nothing \nis irretrievably lost, but rather, on the contrary, everything is irrevocably stored and treasured. To be \nsure, people tend to see only the stubble fields of transitoriness but overlook and forget the full \ngranaries of the past into which they have brought the harvest of their lives: the deeds done, the \nloves loved, and last but not least, the sufferings they have gone through with courage and dignity. \nFrom this one may see that there is no reason to pity old people. Instead, young people should envy \nthem. It is true that the old have no opportunities, no possibilities in the future. But they have more \nthan that. Instead of possibilities in the future, they have realities in the past—the potentialities they \nhave actualized, the meanings they have fulfilled, the values they have realized—and nothing and \nnobody can ever remove these assets from the past. \n \nIn view of the possibility of finding meaning in suffering, life's meaning is an unconditional one, at \nleast potentially. That unconditional meaning, however, is paralleled by the unconditional value of \neach and every person. It is that which warrants the indelible quality of the dignity of man. Just as \nlife remains potentially meaningful under any conditions, even those which are most miserable, so \ntoo does the value of each and every person stay with him or her, and it does so because it is based\n\f\non the values that he or she has realized in the past, and is not contingent on the usefulness that he \nor she may or may not retain in the present. \n \nMore specifically, this usefulness is usually defined in terms of functioning for the benefit of society. \nBut today's society is characterized by achievement orientation, and consequently it adores people \nwho are successful and happy and, in particular, it adores the young. It virtually ignores the value of \nall those who are otherwise, and in so doing blurs the decisive difference between being valuable in \nthe sense of dignity and being valuable in the sense of usefulness. If one is not cognizant of this \ndifference and holds that an individual's value stems only from his present usefulness, then, believe \nme, one owes it only to personal inconsistency not to plead for euthanasia along the lines of Hitler's \nprogram, that is to say, \"mercy\" killing of all those who have lost their social usefulness, be it \nbecause of old age, incurable illness, mental deterioration, or whatever handicap they may suffer. \n \nConfounding the dignity of man with mere usefulness arises from a conceptual confusion that in \nturn may be traced back to the contemporary nihilism transmitted on many an academic campus \nand many an analytical couch. Even in the setting of training analyses such an indoctrination may \ntake place. Nihilism does not contend that there is nothing, but it states that everything is \nmeaningless. And George A. Sargent was right when he promulgated the concept of \"learned \nmeaninglessness.\" He himself remembered a therapist who said, \"George, you must realize that the \nworld is a joke. There is no justice, everything is random. Only when you realize this will you \nunderstand how silly it is to take yourself seriously. There is no grand purpose in the universe. It just \nis. There's no particular meaning in what decision you make today about how to act.\"13 One must \nnot generalize such a criticism. In principle, training is indispensable, but if so, therapists should see \ntheir task in immunizing the trainee against nihilism rather than inoculating him with the cynicism \nthat is a defence mechanism against their own nihilism. \n \n13 \"Transference and Counter transference in Logotherapy,\" The International Forum for Logotherapy, Vol. 5, No. 2 \n(Fall/Winter 1982),pp. 115-18. \n \nLogotherapists may even conform to some of the training and licensing requirements stipulated by \nthe other schools of psychotherapy. In other words, one may howl with the wolves, if need be, but \nwhen doing so, one should be, I would urge, a sheep in wolf's clothing. There is no need to become \nuntrue to the basic concept of man and the principles of the philosophy of life inherent in \nlogotherapy. Such a loyalty is not hard to maintain in view of the fact that, as Elisabeth S. Lukas once \npointed out, \"throughout the history of psychotherapy, there has never been a school as \nundogmatic as logotherapy.\"14 And at the First World Congress of Logotherapy (San Diego, \nCalifornia, November 6-8, 1980) I argued not only for the rehumanisation of psychotherapy but also \nfor what I called \"the degurufication of logotherapy.\" My interest does not lie in raising parrots that \njust rehash \"their master's voice,\" but rather in passing the torch to \"independent and inventive, \ninnovative and creative spirits.\" \n \n14 Logotherapy is not imposed on those who are interested in psychotherapy. It is not comparable to an Oriental bazaar \nbut rather to a supermarket. In the former, the customer is talked into buying something. In the latter, he is shown, and \noffered, various things from which he may pick what he deems usable and valuable. \n \nSigmund Freud once asserted, \"Let one attempt to expose a number of the most diverse people \nuniformly to hunger. \n \nWith the increase of the imperative urge of hunger all individual differences will blur, and in their \nstead will appear the uniform expression of the one unstilled urge.\" Thank heaven, Sigmund Freud \nwas spared knowing the concentration camps from the inside. His subjects lay on a couch designed \nin the plush style of Victorian culture, not in the filth of Auschwitz. There, the \"individual differences\"\n\f\ndid not \"blur\" but, on the contrary, people became more different; people unmasked themselves, \nboth the swine and the saints. And today you need no longer hesitate to use the word \"saints\": think \nof Father Maximilian Kolbe who was starved and finally murdered by an injection of carbolic acid at \nAuschwitz and who in 1983 was canonized. \n \nYou may be prone to blame me for invoking examples that are the exceptions to the rule. \"Sed \nomnia praeclara tarn difficilia quam rara sunt\" (but everything great is just as difficult to realize as it \nis rare to find) reads the last sentence of the Ethics of Spinoza. You may of course ask whether we \nreally need to refer to \"saints.\" Wouldn't it suffice just to refer to decent people? It is true that they \nform a minority. More than that, they always will remain a minority. And yet I see therein the very \nchallenge to join the minority. For the world is in a bad state, but everything will become still worse \nunless each of us does his best. \n \nSo, let us be alert—alert in a twofold sense: Since Auschwitz we know what man is capable of. And \nsince Hiroshima we know what is at stake.\n\f\nAbout the Author \n \nViktor E. Frankl is Professor of Neurology and Psychiatry at the University of Vienna Medical School. \nHe is the founder of what has come to be called the Third Viennese School of Psychotherapy (after \nFreud's psychoanalysis and Adler's individual psychology)—the school of logotherapy. His work has \nbeen called \"perhaps the most significant thinking since Freud and Adler\" by the American Journal of \nPsychiatry. \n \nBorn in 1905, Dr. Frankl received the degrees of Doctor of Medicine and Doctor of Philosophy from \nthe University of Vienna. During World War II he spent three years at Auschwitz, Dachau, and other \nconcentration camps. \n \nDr. Frankl first published in 1924 in the International Journal of Psychoanalysis and has since \npublished thirty books, which have been translated into twenty-three languages, including Japanese \nand Chinese. He has been a visiting professor at Harvard, as well as at universities in Pittsburgh, San \nDiego, and Dallas. Honorary doctoral degrees have been conferred upon him by twenty-seven \nuniversities, and the American Psychiatric Association has honoured him with the Oskar Pfister \nAward. He has been a guest lecturer at universities throughout the world and has made more than \nninety lecture tours throughout the United States alone."
