    "raw_text": "MODERN MAN \nIN SEARCH OF A SOUL \nDREAM-ANALYSIS IN ITS PRACTICAL \nAPPLICATION \nTHP. use of drea.m-.analys1s in psychotherapy is still a \nmuch-debated question Many practitioners .find 1t mdts­\npensable 1n the treatment of neuroses, and ascnbe as much \nimportance to the psycluc activity manifested m dreams \nas to consctousness 1tse1f Others, on the contrary, dispute \nthe value of dream-analysis, and regard dreams as a negbgible \nby-product of the psyche \nObvmusly. d a person holds the view that the uncon.scJ.ous \nplays a lea.dmg rOle 111 the fonnabon of neuroses, he will \nattnbute practical s1gru:ficance to dreams as direct ex­\npressJ.ons of the unconscious. If, on the other hand, he \ndemes the unconscious or thmks that 1t has no part in the \ndevelopment of neuroses, he will nnnumze the :unportance \nof dream-analysis. It is regrettable that m this year of \ngrace 1931, more than half a century since Carus formulated \nthe concept of the unconscious, over a century Since Kant \nspoke of the \" llllDleasura.ble . . . field of obscure ideas \", \nand nearly two hundred years since Leibniz postulated an \n• \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nDREAM-ANALYSIS \nunconscious psychic activity, not to mention the achieve­\nments of Janet, Flournoy and Freud-that after all this, \nthe actuality of the unconscious should still be a matter \nfor controversy. Since it 1S my intention to deal exclusively \nwith questions of practical treatment, I will not attempt in \nthis place a deleoce of the hypothesis of the unconscious, \nthough it is obvious enough that dream-analysis stands or \nfalls with this hypothesis. Without it the dream appears \nto be merely a freak of nature, a meaningless conglomerate \nof memory-fr'l!meots left over from the happenings of the \nday. Were the dream nothmg more than this, there would \nbe no excuse for the present discussion We must recogmze \nthe unCODSC10us if we are to treat of dream-analysis at all, \nfor we do not resort to it as a mere exercise of the wits, but \nas a method for uncovering hitherto unconscious psyclnc \ncontents which are causally related to the neurosis and \ntherefore of importance in its treatment. Anyone who \ndeems tlus hypothesis unacceptable must simply rule out \nthe question of the practicability of dream-analysis. \nBut since, according to our hypothesis, the unconscious \nplays a causal part in the neurosis, and smce dreams are \nthe direct expresmon of UDCOilSClous psychic activity, the \nattempt to analyse and mterpret dreams 1S entirely Justified. \nfrom a scientmc standpoint. Quite apart from therapeutic \nresults, we may expect this line of endeavour to give us \nscientific insight mto psychic causality. For the praci:ttioner, \nhowever, scientific discoveries can at most be a gratifying \nby-product of his efforts in the field of therapy. He will \nnut feel called upon to apply dream-analysis to his patients \non the chance that it may throw light upon the problem \nof psychic causality. He may believe, of course, that the \ninlicht so gained IS of therapeutic val11&-in wluch case \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nDREAM-ANALYSIS \nhe will regaxd dream-analysis as one of his professional \nduties. It is well known that the Freudian school is of \nthe opinion that important therapeutic effects are achieved \nby throwing hght upon the unconscious causal fa.ctom-­\nthat IS, by explairung them to the patient and thus making \nbun conscious of the soun:es of 1us trouble. \nIf we assume. for the time bemg, that this expectation \nis borne out by the facts, we can restrict omselves to the \nquestions whether or not dream•analysis enables us to \ndiscover the unconscious causes of the neurosis, and whether \nit can do tins utl8lded, or must be used in conjunction with \nother methods. The Freudian answer, I ma.y assume, is \ncommon knowledge. My own experience confirms this view \ninasmuch as I have found that dreams not mfrequently bring \nto light 1n an unmistakable way the uncODSCious contents \nthat are causal factors in a neurosis Most often it is the \nin1bal dreams that do this---1 mean, those dreams that a \npatient reports at the very outset of a treatment. An \nillustration will perhaps be helpful. \nI was consulted by a man who held a prominent position \nin the world. He was afflicted with a sense of anxiety and \ninsecurity, and complamed of chzziness sometimes resultmg \nin nausea, of a heavy head and drlnculty in breathing-this \nbemg an exact descnpbon of the symptoms of mountain­\nSJ.Ckness. He had had an unusually successful career, and \nhad risen, with the help of amb1bon, industry and nahve \ntalent, from a humble origin as the son of a poor peasant. \nStep by step he had climbed, attaining at last an important \npoat that offered him every opportunity for further social \nadvancement. He had actually reached a place in life \nfrom wluch he could have begun lus ascent into the upper \nregions, when suddenly his neUJ'OSlS mtenrened. At this \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\n4 DREAM-ANALYSIS \npoint of his story the patient could not refrain from that \nstereotyped e,rclamation which begins with the familiar \nwords. \"And just now, when I ... \" The fa.et that he \nhad all the symptoms of mountain-sickness was highly \nappropriate to the peculiar situation in which he found \nhimself He had brought with hDn to the consultation -\ndreams of the pteeeding night. \nThe :first dream was as follows · \" I am once more in \nthe small village where I was born. Some peasant boys \nwho went to school with me are stand.mg together in the \nstreet. I walk past them, pretendmg not to lmow them I \nhear one of them. who is pointing at me, say: 'He doesn't \noften come back to our village.' \" No tncks of interpretation \nare needed to recognize and to understand the allUS1on to \nthe humble beginmngs of the dreamer's career. The dream \nsays quite clearly . \" You forget how far down you \nbegan.\" \nHere is the second dream \" I am in a great hurry \nbecause I am gomg on a Journey. I hunt up my bdgg'age, \nbut cannot find 1t. Time flies, and the tram 'Ylll1. soon be \nleaving. Finally I succeed in getting all my things together \nI hurry along the street, discover that I have forgotten \na bnef-case contaunng lltlportant papers, dash breathlessly \nback again, find it at last, and then run towards the stahon, \nbut make hardly any headway. With a final effort I rush \non to the platform only to find the tram steaming out into \nthe yards. It is very long, and runs in a curious S-sha.ped \ncurve It occurs to me that if the driver is not careful, and \nputs on full steam when he comes to the straight stretch, \nthe rear coaches w1U still be on the curve and will be thrown \nover by the speed of the train. As a ma.tter of fact the \ndriver opens the throttle as I try to shout. The rear coaches \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nDREAM-ANALYSIS \nrock frightfully, and are actually thrown off the rails. There \nis a tern.hie catastrophe. I awake in terror.\" \nHere, too, we can understand without much diffi.culty \nthe situation represented. by the dream. It pictares the \npatient's frantic haste to advance himself still further \nSince the driver at the front of the train goes thoughtlessly \nahead, the coaches behind him rock and finally overturn­\nthat is, a neurosis is developed. It 1S clear that, at this \nperiod of hie, the panent had reached the highest point \nof his career-that the effort of the long ascent from his \nlowly origin had exhausted his strength. He should have \ncontented himself with his aclrlevements, but instead he \nis dnven by his ambition to attempt to scale heights of \nsuccess for wluch he 1S not fitted The neuroSIS came upon \nhim as a warning. Circumstances prevented my treatmg \nthe patient, and my view of lus case did not satisfy bun \nThe upshot was that events ran their course in the way \nindicated by the dream. He tried to exploit the professwnal \nopenings that tempted lus ambition and mu so violently \noff the track that the tram-wreck was reahzed m actual \nhfe The patient's anamnesis permitted the inference that \nthe m.ountazn-su:kness pomted to lus mablllty to climb any \nfurther. The inference 1s confirmed by lus dreams which \npresent tlus mabihty as a fact \nWe here come upon a charactenshc of dreams that must \ntake first place in any discus,ion of the apphcability of \ndream-analysis to the treatment of neuroses The dream gives \na in1e picture of the subjective state, while the conscious \nmind denies that this st.ate exists, or recognizes it only \ngrudgingly. The patient's conscious ego could see no \nreason why he should not go steadtly forward ; he continued \nhis struggle for advancement, refusing to admit the fact \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\n6 DREAM-ANALYSIS \nwhich subsequent events made all too plain-that he was \nactually at the end of his tether When, m such cases, we \nlisten to the dictates of the COllS('lOUS mmd, we are always \nin doubt. We can draw opposite concIUS1ons from the \npatient's anamnesis After all, the pnvate soldJ.er may \ncany a marshal's baton m his knapsack, and many a. son \nof poor parents has achieved the highest success. Why \nshould it not be so in my patient's cao;e ;, Smee my Judge­\nment is fallible, why should my own con1ecture J>e more \ndependable than his l At tills point the dream comes m \nas the expression of an mvoluntary psycluc process not \ncontrolled. by the conscious outlook It presents the \nsubjective state as 1t really is It has no respect for my \nconjectures or for the patient's views as to how things should \nbe, but simply tells how the matter stands. I have therefore \nmade 1t a rule to put dreams on a plane with physiological \nfact If sugar appears in the unne, then the unne contains \nsugar, and not albumen or urobtlm or somethmg else that \nI may have been led to expect. Tins is to say that I take \ndreams as facts that are invaluable for cbagnosis \nIt is the way of dreams to give us more than we ask, \nand this is true of those I have just cited as illustrations \nThey not only allowed us an mSJght into the causes of the \nneurosis, but afforded a prognosis as well. What is more, \nthey showed us at what point the treatment should begm \nThe patient must be preveoted from going full steam ahead \nThis is precisely what he tells himself m the dream. \nFor the time being we will content ourselves with this \nhint, and return to the question whether dreams enable \nus to explam the causes of a neurosis. I have cited two \ndreams that actually do this. But I could equally well \ncite any number of initial dreams which do nothing of the \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nDREAM-ANALYSIS 7 \nkind, although they are perfectly transparent. I do not \nwish for the present to consider dreams which call for \nsean:lnng analysis and interpretation. \nThe point is that there are neuroses whose actual origins \nwe discover only at the very eod of an analysis, and there \nare also cases m which it IS of. no benefit to have discovered \nthe ongm of the neurosis. Thts brings me back to the \nFreudian view, mentioned above, that for the purposes of \ntherapy ,it is necessary for the patient to become COilSCJ.OUS \nof the causal facton m his disturbance-a view that 19 httle \nmore than a survival of the old theory of the trauma. I do \nnot, of course, deny that many neuroses have a traumatic \norigin , I simply contest the notion that all neuroses are \nof tins nature and arise without exception from some \ncrucial expenence of childhood. Tlus view of the question \nresults m a causahs!K: approach. The doctor must give \nhis whole attention to the patient's past ; he must always \nask . \" Why ;i \" and neglect the equally pertinent question : \n\" What for > \" This is frequently very harmful to the \npatient, for he is forced to search in his memory-perhaps \nover a course of years-for a hypotheb.cal event in lus \nchtldhood, whtle tlnngs of munediate importance are grossly \nneglected A purely causa.hstic approach is too narrow to \ndo JUStic-e to the true significance, either of the dream, or of \nthe neurosis A person is biassed who turns to dreamc; for the \nsole purpose of discovering the lndden cause of the neurosis, \nfor he leaves as,de the larger part of the dream's actual \ncontn\"bution. The dreams I have cited unmistakably \npresent the ztiological factors in the neurosis , but it is \nclear that they alao offer a prognosis or anticipation of the \nfuture and a suggestion as to the course of treatment as \nwell. We must furthennore bear in mind that a great \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nDREAM-ANALYSIS \nmany dreams do not touch upon the causes of the neurosis, \nbut treat of quite different matters-among others, of the \npatient's attitude to the doctor. I should hke to illustrate \nthis by recountmg three dreams of the same patient. She \nconsulted three different analysts in turn, and at the \nbegimung of each treatment she had one of these dreams. \nHere is the :first : \" I must cross the frontier into the \nnext country, but no one can tell me where the boundary \nlies, and I cannot find 1t.\" The treatment which followed \nthis dream was unsuccessful, and was soon broken off \nThe second dream is as follows · \" I must cross the \nfrontier It ts a black night, and I cannot find the custom­\nhouse. After a long search I notice a small light far away \nand suppose that the fronb.er he,r; over there But m order \nto reach 1t, I must cross a valley and pass through a dark \nwood, m wluch I lose my sense of direction Then I notice \nthat someone IS with me. Tins person suddenly clings to \nme like a madman and I awake m terror.\" That treatment \nalso was discontinued after a few weeks, the reason bemg \nthat the patient was completely disoriented by the analyst's \nunconscious identification with her. \nThe tlurd dream took place when the patient came mto \nmy hands. It runs · \" I must cross a frontier, or rather, I \nhave already crossed it, and find myseH in a SWISS custom­\nhouse. I have only a handbag with me, and believe that \nI have nothing to declare But the customs oflictal dives \nmto my bag and, to my astonishment, pulls out two full­\nsized mattresses \" The patient mamed during the course of \nher treatment with me, but not without a violent resistance \nto this step. The cause of her neurone resistance came to \nlight only after many months, and there is not a hmt of 1t \nanywhere in these dreams They are without exception \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nDREAM-ANALYSIS \nanticipations of the difliculties she is to have with the \nanalysts to whom she has come for treatment. \nI could ate many other dreams to the same effect, but \nthese may suffice to show that dreams can be anticipatory \nand, m that case, must lose their pa.rtu:ular meaning if \nthey are treated in a purely causahstic way These three \ndreams give clear Information about the analytical situation, \nand it IS extremely important for the purposes of therapy \nthat this be rightly understood. The first doctor uuderstood \nthe situation and sent the pa.bent to the second. Here she \ndrew her own conclUS10ns from her dream, and deeded to \nleave My mterpretat10n of her third dream dlsa.ppomted \nher greatly, but she was chstinctly encouraged to go on in \nspite of all difficulties by the fact that 1t reported. the frontier \nalready crossed. \nImtia.J. dreams are often ama.zmgly transparent and \nclear-cut But as the \\\\-otk of analysis progresses, the \ndreams m a httle while cease to be clear If they should \nprove excepbonal, and keep their clanty, we can be sure \nthat the analysis has as yet not touched some 1ID.portant \npart of the personality. As a rule, the dreams become less \ntransparent, and more blurred, shortly after the beginning \nof the treatment. It becomes increasingly difficult to \ninterpret them, a further reason for thIS being that a point \nmay soon be reached where the doctor is unable, if the truth \nbe told, to understand the Situation as a whole This is how \nthe matter really stands, for to say that the dreams are \nunmtelhgible is a mere reflection of the doctor's subjective \nopmion Nothing is unclear to the understand.mg , it is \nonly when we fall to widerstand that things appear unintel­\nligible and confused. In themselves, dreams are clear­\nthat is, they are Just as they must be uuder the given \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nDREAM-ANALYSIS \nconditions. If we look back at these \" unintelligible \" \ndreams from a later stage of the treatment or from a distance \nof some years, we are often astounded at our own blindness, \nIt 18 a fact that, as an analysis progresses, we come upon \ndreams that are strikingly obscure in comparisoo with the \ninitial dreams. But the doctor should not be too sure that \nthese later dreams are really confused, or be too hasty in \naccusing the patient of dehberate resistance He would do \nbetter to take the fact as an indication of his own growing \ninability to understand the situation. The psychiatrist \nlikewise is prone to call a patient \" confused \" when he \nwould do well to recognize the pro1ection and admit his \nown confusion, for 1t is really his understand.mg that grows \nconfused in face of the patient's strange behaviour. For \nthe purposes of therapy, moreover, it is highly important \nfor the analyst to adnut Ins lack of understanding from time \nto time, for nothing IS more unbearable for the pahent \nthan to be always understood The latter in any case \nrelies too much upon the mysterious mmght of the doctor, \nand, by appealing to 1us professional vanity, lays a dangerous \ntrap for him. By taking refuge in the doctor's self-confidence \naod \" profound \" understandmg, the patient loses all sense \nof rea.hty, falls into a stubborn transference, and retards \nthe cure. \nUnderstandmg is clearly a sub1ect1ve process It may \nbe very one-sided, m that the physician understands whtle \nthe patient does not In such a case the doctor somet1.m.es \nfeels it his duty to convmce the pat:J.ent, and if the latter \nwill not allow himself to be convmced, the doctor accuses \nhim of resistance. When the understandmg lS all on my \nside, I find it advisable to stress my lack of understanding. \nIt is relatively unimportant whether the doctor understands \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nDREAM-ANALYSIS n \nor not, but everything hangs on the patient's doing so \nWhat is really needed is a mutual agreement which is the \nfruit of Joint refl.ecbon. It is one-sided, and therefore \ndangerous, understanding for the doctor to prejudge the \ndream from the standpoint of a certa.J.n doctrine and to \nmake a pronouncement which may be theoretically sound, \nbut does not wm the patient's assent. Jn so far aCJ the \npronouncement fails m tlus respect, it is incorrect in the \npractical sense, and it may also be mcorrect in the sense that \n,t anticipates and thereby cripples the actual development \nof the patient. We appeal only to the patlent's bram if \nwe try to mculcate a truth ; but if we help him to grow \nup to this troth in the course of ht,; own development, we \nhave reached Ins heart, and this appeal goes deeper and \nacts with greater force \nWhen the doctor's interpretation is based merely upon \na one-sided theory or a preconceived opmion, his chances \nof convincing the patient or of aclueving any therapeutic \nresults depend chiefly upon suggestion And let no one \ndeceive lumself as to the effects of suggestion. In itself \nsuggest1011 is not to be despised, but 1t has senous ]1D11tations, \nand reacts upon the patient's mdependence of character \nm a very undesirable way. A pract1Slll8' analyst may be \nsupposed to believe m the sigmfi.cance and value of the \nwidening of conscwusness-1 mean by tins the procedure \nof bnngmg to light the parts of the personahty which were \npreviously unCODSClOUS and sabjectmg them to conscious \ndiscrimination and cnhcism. It IS an undertaking which \nrequires the patient to face his problems, and taxes his \npowers of conscious judgement and declSlon. It is nothing \nless than a challenge to the ethical sense, a call to arms that \nmust be answered by the whole personality. Therefore, \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\n.. DREAM-ANALYSIS \nwith respect to personal development, the analytical approach \nis of a higher order than methods of treatment based upon \nsuggestion. This is a kind of magre that works m the dark \nand makes no ethical demands upon the personality. \nMethods of treatment based upon suggestion are deceptive \nmakeshifts , they are incompatible ~ith the principles of \nanalytical therapy, and should be avoided. But suggestion \ncan of course be avoided only when the doctor is aware of \nthe many doors through which it can enter There remams \nin the best of circumstances enough-and more than \nenough-unconscious suggestion. \nThe analyst who wishes to rule out conscious suggestion \nmust consider any dream interpretation invalid that does \nnot wm the assent of the patient, and he must search until \nhe finds a formulation that does. This is a rule which, \nI believe, must always be observed, especially m dealing \nwith those dreams whose obscunty is evidence of lack of \nunderstanding on the part of the doctor as well as of the \npatient. The doctor should regard every dream as a new \ndeparture--as a soucce of infonnat10n about unknown \nconcb:bons concerning which he has as much to leam as \nthe patient. It goes without saying that he should hold \nno preconceived opinions based upon a particular theory, \nbut stand ready in every smgle case to construct a totally \nnew theory of dreams. There is sWl a boundless opportunity \nfor pioneer-work m this field. \nThe view that dreams are merely imaginary fulfilments \nof suppressed wishes has long ago been superseded. It IS \ncertamly true that there are dreams winch embody sup­\npressed wishes and fears, but what is there which the \ndream cannot on occasion embody ? Dreams may give \nexpreSS1on to ineluctable truths, to philosophical pro-\nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nDREAM-ANALYSIS I3 \nnouncements, illusions, wtld fantasies, memories, plans, \nanticipations, irrational experiences, even telepathic visions, \nand heaven knows what besides. One thing we ought \nnever to forget : almost the half of our lives is passed m , \na more or less unconscious state. The dream 1,; specifically \nthe utterance of the unconscious We may call CODSClOUSDess \nthe dayhght realm of the human psyche, and cootrast it \nwith the nocturnal reaJm of unconscious psychic activtty \nwhich we apprehend as dreamlike fantasy. It is certain \nthat consciousness consists not only of wishes and fears, \nbut of vastly more than these, and it is lugbly probable that \nthe unconscious psyche contains a wealth of contents and \nlivmg forms equal to or even greater than does conscwus-­\nness, which 1s characterized by concentration, hmltation \nand excluSion \nThis being the state of affairs, it is imperative that we \nshould not pare down the meaning of a dream to fit some \nnarrow doctrine. We must remember that there are not \na few patients who umtate the technical or theoretical \njargon of the doctor, and do this even in their dreams \nNo language eXIsts that cannot be misused It is hard to \nreahze how badly we are fooled by the abuse of ideas , 1t \neven seems as 1f the unconscious had a way of stranglmg \nthe physician m the coils of hIS own theoxy All tins bemg \nso, I leave theory aside as much as possible in analysing \ndreams. We cannot, of oomse, dispense with theory \nenbrely, for it is needed to make things intellig,ble. It is \non the basis of theory, for mstance, that I expect dreams \nto have a meaning. I cannot prove m every case that \ndreams are meanmgfu.l, for there are dreams that neither \ndoctor nor patient understands. But I must regard them \nas hypothetically meaninglul in order to find courage to \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nI4 DREAM-ANALYSIS \ndeal with them at all. To say that dreams contribute in an \nimportant way to conscious knowledge, and that a dream \nwhich fails to do so is a dream which has not been properly \ninterpreted-this, too, is a theoretical statement But I \nmust adopt this hypothesis in order to make it clear to \nmyseH why I analy,,e dreams On the other hand, every \nhypothesis about the nature of the dream, its function and \nstructure, is merely a rule of thumb and must be subject \nto constant modrlicatwns. We must never forget in dream­\nanalysis, even for a moment, that we move on treacherous \nground where notbmg is certain but uncertainty. A \nsuitable warning to the dream-interpreter-if only it were \nnot so parado:x1cal-would be : \" Do anything you hke, \nonly don't try to understand I \" \nWhen l\\--e take up an obscure dream, our first task is not \nto understand and mterpret it, but to estabhsh the context \nwith minute care. What I have in mind is not a boundless \nsweep of \" free associations \" startmg from any and every \nimage in the dream, but a careful and conscious illwnmation \nof those chains of associa.hon that are chrectly connected \nwith particular images Many patients have first to be \neducated to this task, for they resemble the doctor in their \nurgent desire to understand and to mterpret offhand. Tlus \nis particularly the case when they have already been \neducated-or rather, miseducaU'd-by their reading or by a \nprevious analysis that went wrong. They give assoc,ations \nm accordance with a theory ; that is, they try to understand \nand interpret, and thus they nearly always get stuck. Like \nthe doctor, they wish at once to get behind the dream in \nthe false belief that it is a mere f~ conceahog the truo \nmeaning. Perhaps we may call the dream a ~. but \nwe must remember that the fronts of most houses by no \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nDREAM-ANALYSIS \nmeans trick or deceive us, but, on the contrary, follow the \nplan of the building and often betray its inner arrangement. \nThe \" manifest \" dream-picture 1S the dream itseH, and \ncontains the \" latent \" meaning If I find sugar in the \nurine, it is sugar, and not a~ that conceals albumen. \nWhen Freud speaks of the \" dream-~• \", he IS really \nspeaking, not of the dream itseH, but of its obscunty, and \nin so dDDlg is projecting upon the dream Ins own lack of \nunderstandmg. We say that the dream has a false front \nonJy because we fall to see into 1t. We would do better to \nsay that we are deabng with something like a text that \nIS uninteJli«,ble, not because 1t has a la~e. but sunply \nbecause we cannot read it. We do not have to get behind \nsuch a text m the first place, but must learn to read it \nWe shall best succeed 1n readmg dreams by estabhshing \nthel.f context, as already remarked. We shall not succeed \nwith the help of free assoCJ.a:tions, any more than we could \nuse that means to dectpher a Hittite mscriphon Free \nassociations will help me to uncover all my own complexes, \nbut for this purpose I need not start from the dream-I \nnught as well take a sentence in a newspaper or a \" Keep \nout \" sign. If we associate freely to a dream, our complexes \nwill turn up nght euough, but we shall hardly ever discover \nthe meaning of the dream. To do this, we must keep as \nclose as possible to the dream-images themselves. When \na pen,on has dreamed of a deal table, bttle is accomplished \nby his associating it with Ins wntmg-desk which is not \nmade of deal. The dream refers expressly to a deal table. \nIf at this point nothing occurs to the dreamer, his hesitation \nsrgniftes that a particular darkness surrounds the dream­\nimage, and this is suspicious. We would expect bun to \nhave dozens of associations to a deal table, and when he \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nI6 DREAM-ANALYSIS \ncannot find a single one, this must have a meaning. In \nsuch cases we should return agam and again to the image \nI say to my patients : \" Suppose I had no idea what the \nwords 'deal table' mean. Descnbe this ob1ect and give me \n1ts history in such a way that I cannot fail to understand \nwhat sort of thing it is.\" We succeed in this way in \nestabhshing a good part of the context of that particular \ndream-image. When we have done this for all the images \nin the dream, we are ready for the venture of interpretation \nEvery mterpretation is hypothetical, for it is a mere \nattempt to read an unfamiliar text. An obscure dream, \ntaken by 1tseH, can rarely be interpreted with any certainty, \nso that I attach little importance to the interpretation of \nsingle dreams. With a senes of dreams we can have more \nconfidence in our mterpretations, for the later dreams \ncorrect the mistakes we have made m handling those that \nwent before. We are also better able, ma dream senes, to \nrecognize the important contents and basic themes, and \nI therefore urge my patients to make a careful record of \ntheir dreams and the interpretations given them. I also \nshow them how to work up their dreams in the way I have \njust inchcated, so that they can bnng me in wnting the \ndream and the matenal that forms the context of the \ndream. In later stages of analysis I let them work out the \nmterpretations as well. The patient learns in this way how \nto consult the unconscious without the doctor's help. \nIf dreams did nothing more than inform us about the \ncausal factors in a neurosis, we could safely let the doctor \nhaodle them alone. My way of dealing with them, more­\nover, would be quite superfluous if all that we could expect \nof them were a collection of hints and insights helpfol to \nthe doctor. But since it is probable, as I have shown in \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nDREAM-ANALYSIS •7 \na few examples, that dreams contain more than practical \nhelps for the doctor, dream-analyms deserves very special \ncorundera.tion. Somebmes, indeed. it is a matter of hfe \nand death. \nAmong many cases of this sort, I have been especially \nimpressed with one that concerned a colleague of mine \nin Zmich. He was a man somewhat older than myself \nwhom I saw from t1D1.e to tune, and who always teased me \non these occasions about my mterest m dream-Interpretation. \nI met lum one day m the street, and he called out to me : \n\" How are thmgs going? Are you still mterpreting dreams ? \nBy the way, I've had another 1d.iobc dream. Does 1t mean \nsomethmg too ; \" He had dreamed as follows : ., I am \nchmbmg a high mountain over steep, snow-covered slopes. \nI mount higher and higher-it is marvellous weather.

And I discover \nthat I actually can do this. I go on climbing on empty air. \nI awake in a real ecstasy.\" When he had told me his \ndream, I said: \" My dear man, I know you can't give \nup mountameering, but let me implore you not to go al.one \nfrom now on. When you go, take two guides, and you \nmust promise on your word of honour to follow their \ndirections \" \" Incomgible I \" he rephed laughing, and said \ngood-bye I never saw him again. Two months later came \nthe first blow. When out alone, he was buried by an \navalanche, but was dug out in the nick of time by a military \npatrol which happened to come along. Three months after \nthis the end came. He went on a climb accompamed by \na younger friend, but without guides. An alpimst standing \nB \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nI8 DREAM-ANALYSIS \nbelow saw him hterally step out into the au as he was \nletting hunself down a rock wall.

When \nwe see that at least a half of man's hie is passed in tlus \nreahn, that CODSCiousness has its roots there, and that the \nunconscious operates in and out of waking existence, 1t \nwould seem incumbent upon medical psychology to shaipen \nits perceptions by a systemahc study of dreams. No one \ndoubts the importance of conscious e:x:penence ; why then \nshould we question the unportance of unconstlOus hap­\npenings 1 They also belong to human life, aod they are \nsometimes more truly a part of it for weal or woe than any \nevents of the day. \nDreams give information about the secrets of the inner life \nand reveal to the dreamer ludden factors of lns personality. \nAs long as these are undiscovered, they d!sturb his wakmg \nhfe and betray themselves only in the form of symptoms \nThis means that we cannot effectively treat the patient \nfrom the side of consciousness alooe, but must bnng about \na change in aod through the UDCODSC10US As iaI as present \nknowledge goes, there is only ooe way of doing this : there \nmust be a thorough-going, cooscious assimilation of \nunconscious contents.

Such an opimon can \nhave no foundatlon other than the erroneous behef that \nthe unconscious is a monster. Such a view arises from fear \nof nature and of hfe as 1t actually 1s Freud has invented \nthe idea of subhmation to save us from the una.gmary claws \nof the unconsc10us But what actually exists cannot be \nalchenustlcally subhmated, and d anything 1s apparently \nsubhmated, 1t never was what a false mterpretatlon took \n1t tobe. \nThe unconscious is not a demonic monster, but a thing \nof nature that is perfectly neutral as far as moral sense, \nzsthetic taste and mtellectual 1udgement go. It is dangerous \nonly when our co11SC1ous attitude towards 1t becomes \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\n20 DREAM-ANALYSIS \nhopelessly false. And this danger grows in the measure \nthat we practise repressions. But as soon as the patient \nbegins to assmillate the conteots that were previously \nunconscious, the danger from the side of the unconscious \ndimimshes. AB the process of assimilation goes on, it puts \nan eod to the dissociation of the pmonality and to the \nanxiety that attends and inspires the separation of the two \nrealms of the psyche. That wluch my critic feared-I \nmean the overwhehning of consciousness by the unconscious \n-is most hkely to occur when the unconscious is excluded \nfrom We by repressions, or is nnsunderstood and depreaated \nA fundamental nu.stake, and one wluch 1S commonly \nmade, is this . it is supposed that the contents of the \nUDCOllSClOUS are uneqmvocal and are marked with plus or \nminus signs that are 1D1Jnutable As I see the question, \nthis view is too naive. The psyche 1s a seli-regulatmg \nsystem that mamtains itself in equilibrium as the body \ndoes. Every process that goes too fa:r immedistely and \ninevitably calls forth a compensatory activity. Without \nsuch adjustments a normal m.etabohsm would not eXISt, \nnor would the normal psyche.

This fact, whJ.Cb. JS easily venfiable, affords a \nrule for dream mterpretation. It is always helpful, when \nwe set out to mterpret a dream, to ask · What conscious \nattitude does it compensate ? \nAlthough compensation may take the form of imagmary \nwish-fulfilment, it generally presents itself as an actuahty \nwluch becomes the more strikingly actual the more we try \nto repress it. We know that we do not conquer thirst by \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nDREAM-ANALYSIS ZI \nrepressing 1t. The dream-content is to be taken in all \nsenousness as something that has actually happened to \nus ; 1t should be treated as a. contnbutory factor m fra.mmg \nour conscious outlook.

The uncoDSC10us would thus \nhave changed its face and completely reversed 1ts pos1tion. \nIt would have become tinudly reasonable, m strikmg \ncontrast to its fonner tone. It is not generally believed \nthat the unconscious operates in tlus way, yet such reversals \nconstantly take place and constitute its essential functlon, \nThis is why every dream is a source of mformation and \na means of self-regulatwn, and why dreams are our most \neffective aids m the task of buikhng up the porsonahty. \nThe UllCOllSClOUS itself does not harbour explosive \nmatenals, but 1t may become ex:plOSJ.ve owing to the \nrepressions exercised by a self-suflicient, or cowardly, \nconscious outlook. All the more reason, then, for givmg \nheed to that Side I It should now be clear why I have made \n1t a practical rule always to ask, before trymg to interpret \na dream . What conscious attitude does it compensate ? \nAs may be seen, I thus bring the dream into the closest \npossible connection with the CODSClOUS state. I even \nma.mtain that it is imposs1ble to mterpret a dream with \nany degree of certamty 11Illess we kn.ow what the CODSClOUS \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\n•• DREAM-ANALYSIS \nsituation is. For it is only in the light of this knowledge \nthat we can make out whether the unconscious content \ncarries a plus or mmus sign. The dream is not an :LSOlated \npsychk event completely cut off from daily We. If it seems \nso to us, that is only an illusion that anses from our lack \nof understanding In reality, the relation between con­\nSC1ousness and the dream is strictly causal, and they interact \nin the subtlest of ways. \nI should hke to show WJ.th the help of an illustrab.on how \nimportant it is to find the trne value of unconscious contents. \nA young man brought me the following dream : \" My \nfather is driving away from the house in bis new car. He \ndnves very clumsily, and I get very excited about !us \napparent stupidity He goes tlus way and that, forward \nand backward, repeatedly gettmg the car mto a tight place \nFmally he runs into a wall and badly damages the car. \nI shout at hun m a perfect rage, telling bun he ought to \nbehave lmnsell My lather only laughs, and then I see \nthat he is dead drunk.\" There is no foundab.on in fact \nfor the dream The dreamer is convinced that lus father \nwould never behave m that way, even 1f he were drunk. \nThe dreamer himself lS used to cars ; he is a careful dnver, \nand very moderate in the use of alcohol, especially when he \nhas to drive. Bad dnvmg, and even slight inJunes to the \ncar, imtate him greatly. The son's relatwn to his father \nis good He admires lum for being an unusually successful \nman We can say, without any attempt at mterpTetation, \nthat the dream presents a vecy unfavourable picture of \nthe father What, then, should we take its meaniDg to \nbe as far as the son IS concerned ? Is 1ns relation to blS \nlather good only in appearance, and does 1t really consist \nof over-compensated resistances ? If this 1S so we should \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nDREAM-ANALYSIS 23 \nattnbute a plus sign to the dream-content ; we should have \nto tell the young man . \" Tfus is your actual relation to \nyour father.\" But SIDce I could find nothing equivocal or \nneurotic in the facts about the son's relation to his father. \nI had no wammt for dJsturbmg the young man's feelings \nwith such a destructive pronouncement. To do so would \nhave prejudiced the outcome of the treatment. \nBut If !us relation to his father is really excellent, why \nmust the dream manufacture such an hnprobable story to \ndiscredit the father ? The dreamer's unconscious must have \na chstinct tendency to produce such a dream. Has the \nyoung man resistances to his father, after all, which are \nperhaps led by Jealousy or a certain sense of ioferionty ? \nBut before we go out of our way to burden his conscience-­\nand with sens,tlve young people there is always the risk \nthat we do tlus too hghtly-we had better, for once, drop \nthe question of why he had this dream, and ask ourselves \nmstead. · What for ? The answer, in tlus case, would be \nthat his uoconscwus clearly tries to depreciate his father. \nIf we take this as a compensation, we are forced to the \nconclusion that !us relation to his father is not only good, \nbut even too good. The young man actually deserves the \nFrench sobnquet of jils tl papa. His father is still too \nmuch the guarantor of his existence, and he is still living \nwhat I call a provisional life. He runs the nsk of failing \nto reahze himself because there is too much \" father \" on \nevery side. This is why the unconscious manufactures a \nkind of blasphemy : it seeks to lower the father and to \nelevate the son. \"An immoral business\", we may be \ntempted to say. Every father who lacks insight would be \non his guard here. And yet this compensation is entirely \nto the point. It forces the son to contrast himself with his \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nDREAM-ANALYSIS \nfather, and that is the only way m which he can become \naware of himself. \nThe interpretation JUSt outlined was apparently the \ncorrect one, for it struck home It won the spontaneous \nassent of the young mao, aod did no violence to his feeling \nfor !us lather, or to the lather's feeling for him. But this \ninterpretation was only poss1ble when the father-son relation \nhad been studied in the light of all the fa.cts that were \naccessible to consciousness. Without a knowledge of the \nconscious SJ.tuation the true meaning of the dream would \nhave remained in doubt. \nIt is of the first rmportance for the assimilation of dream­\ncontents that no violence be done to the real values of \nthe conscious personality. If the conscious personality is \ndestroyed, or even crippled, there is no one left to do the \nassunilating. When we recognize the importance of the \nunCODSClous we are not embarkmg upon a Bolshevist \nexperiment winch puts the lowest on top. This would only \nbring about a return of the situation we are trying to correct. \nWe must see to it that the conscious persona.bty remains \nmta.ct, for we can only tum the unconscious compensa:b.ons \nto good account when the coDSCious personality co-operates \nin the venture. When 1t comes to the assimilation of a \ncontent 1t is never a question of \"this or that \", but of \n\"tlus ·\"\"that\". \nJust as the interpretation of dreams requires exact \nknowledge of the COllSClOUS \"\"'1fs quo, so the treatment of \ndream symbolis;m demaods that we take into a.coount the \ndreamer's plulooopbical, religious and moral convictions. \nIt is far wiser in practice not to rega,d the dream-symbols \nas signs or symptoms of a fixed character. We should \nrather take them as true symbols-that is to say, as \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nDREAM-ANALYSIS \nexpressions of something not yet consciously recognized or \nconceptually fonnulated. In adchtion to this, they must \nbe considered in relation to the dreamer's immechate state \nof CODSC1ousness. I emphasize that tins way of treating \nthe dream-symbols IS advisable in practice because theoretic­\nally there do exist relatively fixed symbols whose meaning \nmust on no account be referred to anything whose content \nIS known, or to anytlung that can be formulated m concepts. \nIf there were no relatively fixed symbols, it would be \nunpossible to determine the structure of the uncOOSCious \nThere would be nothing in it which could be in any way \nlaid hold of or described. \nIt may seem strange that I should attribute an indefinite \ncontent to the relatively fixed symbols But it is the \nindefinite content that marks the symbol as against the \nmere sign or symptom. It is well known that the Freudian \nschool operates with hard and fast sexual ., symbols \" , \nbut these are 1ust what l should call SlgllS, for they are \nmade to stand for sexuahty, and this 1s supposed to be \nsomething definitive. As a matter of fact, Freud's concept \nof sexuality is thoroughly elastic, and so vague that it \ncan be made to include ahn.ost anytlung The word 1tseH \nis familiar, but what it denotes amounts to an indeter­\nminable or vanable x that stands for the physiological \nactivity of the glands at one extreme and the Jugh .. t \nreaches of the spirit at the otber. Instead of taking a \ndogmahc stand that rests upon the illusion that we know \nsomethmg because we have a familiar word fOT it. I prefer \nto regard the symbol as the announcement of something \nunknown, bard to recognize and not to be fully determined. \nTake, for instance, the so-called phallic symbols, which are \nsupposed to stand for the - .,n1, and nothing \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\n26 DREAM-ANAL YSJS \nmore. Psychologically speaking, the membnms is itself­\nas Kranefeldt has recently pointed out-a symbolic unage \nwhose wider content camiot easily be determined. As was \ncustomary throughout antiqmty, primitive people today \nmake a free use of phallic symbols, yet it never occurs to \nthem to confuse the phallus, as a ntualistic symbol, with \nthe penis. They always take the phallus to mean the \ncreative mana, the power of heahng and fertility, \" that \nwhich is unusually potent \", to use Lehmann's expression \nIts equivalents in mythology and in dreams are the bull, \nthe ass, the pomegranate, the y,mi, the he-goat, the lightning, \nthe hmse's hoof, the dance, the magical cohabitatJ.on in the \nfurrow, and the menstrual fluid, to mentJ.on only a few of \nmany. That which UI1derhes all of these images-and \nsexuality itself-is an archetypal content that is hard to \ngrasp, and that finds ,ts best psycholog,cal express10D m \nthe pmmtive mana. symbol. In ea.eh of the unages given \nabove we can see a relatively fixed symbol-u. the num11 \nsymbol-but we camiot for all that be certain that when \nthey occur in dreams they have no other m.eamng \nThe practical need may call for quite another inter­\npretation. To be sure, if we had to interpret dreams m an \nexhaustive way a.ccordmg to scienWic principles, we should \nhave to refer every such symbol to an archetype. But, in \npractice, this kind of interpretation might be a grave \nblunder, for the patient's psychological state may reqmre \nanything rather than the giving of attentwn to a theory \nof dreams. It is therefore advisable, for the purposes of \ntherapy, to look for the meaning of symbols as they relate \nto the COllSC10US situation-in other words, to treat them as \nif they were not fixed. This is as much as to say that we \nmust renounce all preconceived opinions, however knowing \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nDREAM-ANALYSIS .., \nthey make us feel, a.nd try to discover the meaning of things \nfor the pa.hent. If we do this, our interpretations will \nobvJOusly not go very far towards satisfying a theory of \ndreams ; in fact, they may fall very short in this respect, \nBut if the practitioner operates too much with fixed symbols, \nthere is danger of his falhng mto mere routine and dogmatism, \nthus failing to meet the patient's need. It is unfortunate \nthat, to illustrate the above, I should have to go into greater \ndetail tha.n space here permits, but I have elsewhere published \nillustrative ma.tenal that amply supports my statements. \nAs already remarked, it frequently happens at the very \nbegmning of a treatment that a dream reveals to the doctor, \nm a wide perspective, the general direction in which the \nUDCODSClOUS IS moving But, for practical reasons, 1t may \nnot be fea.sJ.ble to make clear to the patient, at thIS early \nstage, the deeper meamng of Ins dream. The demands of \ntherapy are bmdmg upon us m this way also When the \ndoctor gains such a far-reaclung msigb.t, 1t is thanks to his \nexpenence m the matter of relatively fixed symbols. Such \ninsight can be of the very greatest value m diagnosis and \nm prognoSIS as well. I was once consulted in the case of a \nseventeen-year-old girl One specialist had suggested that \nshe IIllght be in the first stages of progresmve atrophy of \nthe muscles, whtle another thought that she was a hystenc. \nBecause of this second opimon, I was called in.

At another time I \ndreamed that a terrible noise breaks out in the house at \nnight. I go to see what has happened, and find that a \nfnghtened horse is tearing through the rooms. At last it \nfinds the door into the hall, and jumps through the hall \nwmdow from the fourth floor down mto the street. I was \ntenifi.ed to see it lying below, all mangled.\" \nThe way in wlnch these dreams allude to death IS enough \nto give one pa.use. But many persons have aruaety dreams \nnow and then. We must therefore look .more closely mto \nthe mea.nu,g of the outstanding symbols, \" mother \" and \n\" horse \". These figures must be eq111valent one to the \nother, for they both do the same thiJlg . they commit \nsuicide The mother symbol is archetypal and refers to \na place of origm, to nature, that which passively creates, \nhence to substance and matter, to material nature, the lower \nbody (womb) and the vegetative functions It connotes \nalso the unconscious, natural and mstinctive hie, the \nphysiological realm, the body in wluch we dwell or are \ncontained, for the \" mother \" is also a vessel, the hollow \nform (Ntems) that carries and nourishes, and it thus stands \nfor the foundations of consc10usness.

The mother \nstands for life at its origin, and the horse for the merely \nanimal life of the body. If we apply this meanmg to the \ndream, it says : the animal life destroys itself. \nThe two dreams make nearly the same assertion, but, as \nis usually the case, the second is more specific. The pecuhar \nsubtlety of the dream. is brought out in both instances . \nthere is no mention of the death of the individual. It is \nnotorious that one often dreams of one's own death, but \nthat is no serious matter. When 1t is really a quest:J.on of \ndeath, the dream speaks another language Both of these \ndreams, then, point to a serious, and even fatal, orgamc \ndisease. The prognosis was shortly after borne out in fact \nAs for the relatively fixed symbols, tins example gives a \nfa.J.r idea of their general nature There are a great many \nof them, and they may differ in individual cases by subtle \nshifts of meaning. It IS cmly through comparative studies \nin mythology, folk-lore, rebgion and language that we can \ndetermine these symbols in a scientific way. The evolu­\ntionary stages through which the human psyche has passed \nare more clearly discermble in the dream than in conscious \nness. The dream speaks in unages, and gives expression \nto instincts, that are derived from the most primitive levels \nof natnre. Conscionsness all too easily departs frnm the \nlaw of nature ; but it can be brought again into harmony \nwith the latter by the assimilation of unconscious contents \nBy fostering this process we lead the patient to the \nrediscovery of the law of his own being. \nI have not been able, in so short a space, to deal with \nanything but the elements of the subject. I could not put \ntogether before ycmr eyes, stooe by stooe, the edifice that \nis reared in every analysis from the materials of the \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nDREAM-ANALYSIS 31 \nunconscious and finds its completion in the restoration of \nthe total personality The way of successive assimilations \nreaches far beyond the curative results that specifically \nconcern the doctor. It leads in the end to that distant \ngoal (which may perhaps have beeo the first urge to hie), \nthe bringing mto reabty of the whole human being-that is, \nindivuluation. We physicians are without doubt the first \nscientific observers of these obscure processes of nature. \nAs a rule we see only a pathological phase of the development, \nand lose mght of the patient as soon as he is cured. But \nit is only when the cure has been effected that we are in \na posit10n to study the normal process of change, itself \na matter of years or decades. If we had some knowledge \nof the ends towards which unconscious, psychic growth 1s \ntendmg, and 11 our psychological insight were not drswn \nexclUS1vely from the pathological phase, we should have \na less confused idea of the processes revealed by dreams \nand a clearer recognition of what it is that the symbols \npoint to In my opimon, every doctor should be aware of \nthe fact that psychotherapy in general, and analysis in \nparticular, is a procedure that breaks into a pUipOSeful and \ncontinuous development, now here and now there, and \nthus singles out particular phases which may seem to follow \nopposlDg courses. Since every analysis by itself shows only \none part or aspect of the deeper course of development, \nnothing but hopeless confusion can result from casuistic \ncomparisons. For this reason I have preferred to confine \nmyself to the rudiments of the subject and to practical \nconsiderations. It is only in actual contact with the facts as \nthey occux that we can come to anything like a satisfactory \nagreement. \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com"

    "raw_text": "II \nPROBLEMS OF MODERN PSYCHOTHERAPY \nPSYCHOTHERAPY, or the treatment of the m..uul by psycho­\nlogical methods, is 1denttfied in popular thought today wtth \n\" psychoanalysis \". Tlus word is now so widely accepted \nthat everyone who uses it seems at the same time to grasp \nits meanmg ; yet 1t is seldom that a layman knows precisely \nwhat 1t covers. \nAccording to the intention of its creator, Freud, 1t can \nbe appropriately applied only to his own particular method \nof explairung psyclnc symptoms in terms of certain repressed \nunpu]ses Inasmuch. as this technique JS the consequence \nof a particular approach to hfe, the idea of psychoanalysis \nmclud.es certain theoreb.cal assumptions, among them the \nFreudian theory of sexuahty. The founder of psychoanalys,s \nhlDlSelf exphcltly insists upon thIS circumscripbon. But, \nFreud notwithstandmg. the layman applies the concept of \npsychoanalysis to every kmd of mod.em endeavour to \nprobe the mind by scientific methods. Thus Adler's school \nmust submit to being labelled \" psychoanalytic \" desplte \nthe fact that Adler's view-point and method are apparently \nin in'econcilable opposition to those of Freud. Because \nof this cootrast, Adler himself does not call his teaching \n\" psychoanalysis \", but \" individual psychology \" ; while I \nprefer to call my own approach \" aoalytical psychology \". \nI wish the term to stand for a general conception embracing \n3\" \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nPROBLEMS OF MODERN PSYCHOTHERAPY 33 \nboth \" psychoanalysis \" and \" individual psychology \", as \nwell as other efforts in this field. \nSmee the mind is common to mankind it may seem to the \nlayman that there can be ooly one psychology, and he may \ntherefore suppose the divergences between the schools to \nbe either subJective qmbbbng, or else a commonplace \nchsgwse for the efforts of mediocrities who seek to exalt \nthemselves upon a throne. I could easily lengthen the \nlist of \" psychologies \" by mentioning other systems that \nare not to be included. under the head of \" analytical \npsychology \" There are, in fact, many methods, stand­\npoints, views and convictJ.ons w1ucb. are all at war with one \nanother-the main reason for this bemg that, smce they \nfatl to be mutually comprehellSlble, none of them can grant \nthe validity of any other The many-sidedness and vanety \nof psychological opmions m our tune 1S notlung less than \naston1slu.ng, and 1t IS confusing for the layman that no \ngeneral survey of them can be made. \nWhen we find the most diverse remedies prescnbed in \na text-book of pathology for a given disease, we may con­\nfidently assume that none of these remedies lS particularly \nefficactous. So, when many chfferent ways of approaching \nthe psyche are recommended, we may rest assured that \nnone of them leads with absolute certainty to the goal, \nleast of all those advocated in a fanatical way. The very \nnumber of present-day \" psychologies \" amounts to a \nconfessioo of perplexity. The dlJ!iculty of gauung access to \nthe mind is gradually borne in upon us, and the mind it.sell \nis seen to be, to use Nietzsche's expression, a \" homed \" \nproblem It IS small wonder therefore that efforts to attack \nthis elusive nddle are multiplied, first from one side and \nthen from another. The variety of contradictory standpoints \nC \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\n34 PROBLEMS OF MODERN PSYCHOTIIERAPY \nand opuuons of which we have spoken is the mevitable \nresult. \nThe reader will doubtless agree that in discussing psycho­\nanalysis we should not lumt ourselves to its narrower \ndefimtion, but deal in general with the results and failures \nof the vanous contemporary endeavours to solve the problem \nof the psyche-endeavours which we have agreed shall all \nbe embraced in the concept of analytical psychology. \nAnd moreover, why is there suddenly so much interest \nm the human psyche as something to be experienced ? \nTins has not been the case for thousands of years I W1Sh \nmerely to raise this apparently irrelevant question, and \nwill not try to answer it. It is in reahty not irrelevant, \nbecause tins mterest underhes all such modern movements \nas theosophy, occultism, astrology and so forth \nAll that is embraced today m the layman's idea of \n\" psychoanalyS1S \" originated in medJ.cal practice ; and \nconsequently most of 1t is medtcal psychology. It bears \nthe ummstakable imprint of the physician's consultmg­\nroom-a fact which is evident not only in 1ts terminology, \nbut also in its framework of theory. We constantly come \nupon postulates wluch the physician has taken over from \nnatural science and in parbcular from biology. Tins fact \nhas largely contnbuted to the hostility between modem \npsychology and the academic fields of philosophy, Iustory \nand ciass,ca] learning. Modem psychology is empincal \nand close to nature, while these studies are grounded m the \nintellect. The chstance between nature and mind, difficult \nto bridge at best, is increased by a medical and biological \nnomenclature which sometnnes appears of practical utility, \nbut more often severely taxes our good-will. \nIn view of the confUS1on of concepts that exists, I have \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nPROBLEMS OF MODERN PSYCHOTHERAPY 35 \nfelt it necessary to indulge in the foregoing general remarks. \nI should hke now to turn to the task in hand and consid,r \nthe actual aclnevements of analytical psychology. Since \nthe various endeavours embraced by this term are so \nheterogeneous, it is extremely difficult to take up a generally \ninclusive standpomt. If, then, with regard to the aims and \nresults of these endeavours, I try to distinguish certam \nclasses, or rather stages, I do it with some reservation. \nI regard 1t as a merely provisional arrangement, and grant \nthat 1t may seem as arbitrary as a surveyor's triangulation \nof a country. Be that as it may, I venture to arrange the \nsum-total of findings under the four heads of confession, \nexplanation, ed.ucat100, and transformation. I shall now \nproceed to discuss the meamng of these somewhat unusual \nterms \nThe first begumings of all analytical treatment are to be \nfound in its prototype, the confessional Since, however, \nthe two pra.cb.ces have no direct causal connection, but \nrather grow from a comm.on psychic root, 1t is drliicult for \nan outsider to see at once the relahon between the ground­\nwork of psychoanalysis and the religious msb.tu:hon of the \nconfessional \nAs soon as man was capable of conceiving the idea of \nsm, he had recourse to psychic concealment-or, to put \nit m analytical language, represmons arose Anytbmg that \nis concealed IS a secret. The maintenance of secrets acts \nhlce a psychic poison which alienates their possessor from \nthe community. In small doses, this poison may actually \nbe a pnceiess remedy, even an essential preliminary to the \ndifferentiation of the inchvtdual. T1us is so much the case \nthat, even on a pnmitive level, man has :felt an irresishble \nneed to invent secrets • their possess10D saves him :from \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\n36 PROBLEMS OF MODERN PSYCHOTIIERAPY \ndissolving in the unconsciousness of mere community life, \nand thus from a fatal psychic inJury. As is well known, the \nmany ancient mystery cults with their secret rituals served \nthis mstinct for differentiation Even the Christian sacra­\nments were looked upon as mysteries m the early Church, \nand, as in the case of baptism, were celebrated in private \napartments and only referred to under a veil of allegory. \nHowwer beneficra.1 a secret shared with several persons \nmay be, a merely pnvate secret has a destructive effect \nIt resembles a burden of gutlt winch cuts off the unfortunate \npossessor from communion with hts fellow-be!llgll. Yet if \nwe are CODSClOUS of what we conceal, the hann done is \ndeculedly less than if we do not know what we are repressmg \n-or even that we have repressions at all. In the latter \ncase we not merely keep a content CODSClously pnvate, but \nwe conceal it even from ourseh•es. It then sphts off from \nconsciousness as an independent complex, to lead a separate \nex15tence m the unconscious, where 1t can be neither \ncorrected nor interfered with by the conscious mmd. The \ncomplex is thus an autonomous porb.on of the psyche wluch, \nas experience has shown, develops a pecuhar fantasy-hie \nof its own What we call fantasy is simply spontaneous \npsychic activity ; and it wells up whenever the repressive \nacb.on of the conscious mind relaxes or ceases altogether, \nas in sleep. In sleep this activity shows itself in the form \nof dreams. And we contmue to dream m waking life \nbeneath the threshold of consciousness, especially when \nthis activity is conditioned by a repressed or otherwise \nunconscions complex It should be said in passing that \nunCOllSClOUS contents are by no means exclusively such as \nwere once conscious and, by being repressed, have later \ngrown into 1lllCOJl8cious complexes. Qw.te otherwise, the \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nPROBLEMS OF MODERN PSYCHOTIIERAPY 37 \nUDCOllSClOUS has contents peculiar to itself wluch, slowly \ngrowing upward from the depths. at last come into conscious­\nness. We should therefore in no wise picture the unconscious \npsyche to ourselves as a mere receptacle for contents discarded \nby the conSCious mmd. \nAll psychic contents wluch either approach the threshold \nof consciousness from below. or have sunk only slightly \nbeneath 1t, have an effect upon our conscious activities. \nSince the content itself is not conscwus, these effects are \nnecessanly indirect. Most of our lapses of the tongue, \nof the pen, of memory, and the hke, are traceable to these \ndisturbances, as are hkewise all neurone symptoms These \nare nearly always of psychic ongin, the excepb.ons being \nshock effects from shell-explosions and other causes The \nmildest forms of neurosis are the \" lapses \" already referred \nto-blunders of speech, the sudden forgetting of names \nand dates, unexpected clumsiness leadmg to mJunes or \naccJ.dents, nusund.erstandmgs of personal motives or of what \nwe have heard or read, and so-called hallucinations of \nmemory which cause us to suppose erroneously that we \nhave said or done t1us or that. In all these cases a thorough \ninvestigation can show the existence of a content wluch m \nan indirect and UDCODSCIOUS way has distorted the CODSClOUS \nperformance. \nIn general, therefore, an unconscious secret lS more \nharmful than one that is conscious I have seen many \npatients in difficult situations of hie wlnch might have \ndriven weaker natures to SUIClde. These patients had at \ntimes a tendency towards suicide, but, on account of their \ninherent reasonableness, would not allow the sw.cidal urge \nto come mto consciousness. But 1t remained active m the \nunconscious, and brought about all kinds of dangerous \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\n38 PROBLEMS OF MODERN PSYCHOTHERAPY \naccidents-as for instance an attack of faintness or hesitation \nin front of an advancing motor-car, the swallowing of \ncorrosive sublimate in the belief that 1t was a cough mixture, \na sudden zest for dangerous acrobatics, and so forth When \nit was possible to make the sw.cidal leaning COllSClOUS, \ncommon-sense could helpfully mtervene ; the patients could \nthen recognize and avoid those situations that tempted them \nto self-destruction. \nAs we have seen, every personal secret has the effect of \na sin or of guilt-whether or not it is, from the standpoint \nof popular morality, a wrongful secret Now another form \nof concealment is the act of \" withhoWing \"-it bemg \nusually emotions that are withheld. As m the case of \nsecrets, so here also we must make a reservation self­\nrestraint is healthful and benefi.ctal ; 1t is even a virtue. \nThis 1S why we find self-chsciphne to have been one of man's \nearliest moral attainments Among prurutive peoples 1t \nhas its place in the initiation ceremomes, chiefly in the \nfonns of ascetic contmence and the st01cal endurance of \npain and fear Self-restraint, however, is here practised \nwithin the secret society as something undertaken in com­\npany with others But if self-restraint is only a pnvate \nmatter, and perhaps dev01d of any rehgious aspect, then 1t \nmay be as harmful as the personal secret. From this kind \nof self-restraint come our well-known ugly moods and the \nimtabihty of the over-virtuous. The emotion withheld is \nalso something we conceal-something which we can h1de \neven from ourselves-an art in which men partJ.cularly \nexcel, while women, with very few exceptions, are by nature \naverse to domg such violence to their emotions. When \nemotion is withheld. it tends to isolate and dtsturb us quite \nas much as an unconscious secret, and is equally gwlt-lad.en. \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nPROBLEMS OF MODERN PSYCHOTHERAPY 39 \nJust as nature bears us ill-will, as it were, if we possess a \nsecret to which mankind has not attained, so also has she \na grudge agamst us 1f we WJ.thhold our emotwns from our \nfellow-men Nature decidedly abhors a vacuum in this \nrespect, m the long run nothmg 1S more unbearable than \na tepid harmony m personal relations brought about by \nwithholdmg emotion The repressed emotions are often of \na kind we W1Sh to keep secret.

Som.ethmg similar \nhas already been observed as an unpleasant result of \nhypnotic treatment, but the mner mechamsm of such a tie \nwas not understood. It now appears that the questionable \nbond essentially corresponds to the relation between father \nand clul.d The patient falls mto a sort of c1uldish. dependence \nfrom which he cannot protect himself even by reason and \ninsight. The fixation IS at times astomshmgly strong-so \nmuch so that one suspects it of bemg fed by forces qwte out \nof the common. But since the process of transference is \nan unconscious one, the patient 1S unable to give any \ninfonnabon about it We are obviously dealing with a \nnew symptom-a neurotic formation directly induced by \nthe treabnent. The question therefore arises : How is \nthis new diffi.culty to be met ?

Now it cmnes to the surface, and-the long-lost \nfather being found again-it tries to reproduce the family \nsituation of childhood. Freud gave to this symptom the \nappropriate name of \" transference \" A certain dependence \nupon the physician who has helped you is of course normal \nand understandable en-h What is abnormal and un­\nexpected is the unusual obstinacy of the transference and \nits ma.ccessibility to conscious correction. \nIt is one of Freud's out.standing a.cluevements to have \nexplained the nature of t1ns tie-at least m the hght of \nman's personal history-and so to have cleared the way \nfor an unportant advance in psychological knowledge It \nbas today been put beyond a doubt that 1t is caused by \nunconscious fantasies. These fantasies have m the Illa.ln \nwhat we may call an \" mcestuous \" character , and tins \nseems adequately to explain the fact that they remam \nlUlCODSClOUS and cannot be expected to tum up m the most \nthorough confession Although Freud always speaks of \nincest-fantasies as 1f they were repressed, further expenence \nshows us that m many cases they have never been coDSCious \nor have been sensed only m the vaguest way-for whu:h \nreason they could not be mtent:J.onally repreued. More \nrecent research seems to show that the incest-fantasies \nare usually unCODSCJous and so rem.am till they are dragged \nto bght in analy1:lcal treatment. By this I do not mean \nthat pulling them up from the unconscious IS an mterference \nwith nature winch we should avoid ; I merely wish to \nsuggest that the procedure is almost as drastic as a surgical \noperation. But it is wholly unavoidable in that the analytical \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nPROBLEI\\IS OF MODERN PSYCHOTHERAPY 45 \nprocedure induces a transference which is abnormal, and \ncan only be dealt with by reaching the incest-fantasies. \nWhile the method of cathaISlS restores to the ego such \ncontents as are accessible to consciousness and are nonnally \nmcluded in it, the process of clea.nng up the transference \nbrings to light conteots which, because of their nature, were \nalmost inaccessible to consciousness Thts is the main \ndiffereoce betweeo the stage of confessioo and the stage \nof explanation. \nWe have discussed above two sets of cases· those of such \npatients as do not lend themselves to the method of catharsis, \nand those for whom it gives results We have moreover \nJust treated of those whose fixation takes the form of a \ntransference Besides these there are those people we have \nalso mentioned who develop no attachment to the physicia.n, \nbut rather one to their own unconscious, in which they \nbecome entangled as in a web. In these cases the parental \nunage is not transferred to a human object It is seen as \na fantasy, and yet 1t exerts the same power of attraction \nand produces the same attachment as does the transference \nThe patients who cannot give themselves without reserve \nto treatment by catharsis can be understood in the hght \nof Freudian research We can see that, even before coming \nto the doctor, they had 1dentuied themselves with their \nparents, and derive from this identification that force of \nauthority, that independence and critJ.ca.l power wlnch \nenables them to offer a successful resistance to the treatment. \nThese are chielly cultivated and diflereotiated persons \nWhile others become the helpless victims of the unconscious \nparental image, these draw strength from 1t by uocoosciously \n1dent1fymg themselves with their parents \nIn the matter of the transference, we can get nowhere \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\n46 PROBLEMS OF MODERN PSYCHOTHERAPY \nwtth the help of confession. It was this which drove Freud \nto a fundamental renovation of Breuer's onginal technique \nof catharsis, and to what he himself called the \" mter­\npretative method \". This further step necessarily follows, \nfor the relationship produced by the transference especially \nrequires explanation. The layman can hardly appreciate \nthe importance of this , but the doctor who finds himself \nsuddenly entangled in a web of incomprehensible and \nfantastic natl.ons sees it all too clearly He must interpret \nthe transference to the patient-that 1s, explain to him \nwhat it is that he proJects upon lns doctor. Since the \npatient himself does not know what 1t lS, the physzcl.B.Il is \nforced to sub1ect what scraps of fantasy he can obtam from \nthe patient to analytical mterpretat10n. It lS first and \nforemost our dreams whtch furrush thts important matenal. \nWhtle investigating the suppress10n of mshes wluch are \nincompatible with our conscious standpoint, Freud studied \ndreams m search of these wishes, and m the process d.J.s.. \ncovered the incestuous contents of which I have spoken. \nThese were of course not the only matenals revealed by \nthe investigation ; he discovered all the filth of which \nhuman nature is capable-and it is notonous that 1t would \nrequire a hfetune to make even a rough inventory of it. \nThe end-product of the Freudian method of explanation \nis a detailed elaboration of man's shadow-side such as had \nnever been carried out before. It is the most effective \nantidote imaginable to all idealistic illusions about the \nnature of man; and 1t is therefore no wonder that there \narose on all sides the most violent opposition to Freud and \nhis school. We could expect nothing else of those who \nbelieve in illusions on principle , but I maintain that there \nare not a few among the opponents of the method of \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nPROBLEMS OF MODERN PSYCHOTHERAPY 47 \nexplanation who have no illusions as to man's shadow-side, \nand who yet object to a biassed portrayal of man from the \nshadow-side alone. After all, the essential thmg is not the \nshadow, but the body whiclt casts it. \nFreud's method of interpretation rests upon \" reductlve \" \nexplanations which unfa.1hngly lead backward and downward, \nand it has a destructive effect 1f 1t is used in an exaggerated \nand one-sided way.

But the fact remains that \nthe most thorough explanation leaves the patient m many \ncases an intelligent but still incapable chtld. The trouble \nis that Freudian explanabons in terms of pleasure and its \nsatisfaction are one-sided and therefore insufficient, espectally \nwheo applied to the later stages of development. Tlus \nviewpoint will not account for everybody , for even 1f \neveryone possesses this side, 1t is not always the most \nnnportant. A hungry artist prefers bread to a beautrlul \npaintmg, and a man in love prefers a woman to his pubhc \ncareer , yet the pamtmg may be of the greatest importance \nto the one and pubhc office to the other.

He may even yield so completely to this passion \nthat nothing else is vital to him. \nAt tlns point we become aware that Freud's explanation \nof things falls short, and it IS prec,sely here that Ins former \npuptl, Adler, comes forward to fill the gap Adler has shown \nconvincingly that many cases of neurosis can be more \nsatlifactorily explained on the ground of an urge to power \nthan by the pleasure principle. His mterpretation therefore \nis designed to show the patient that he \" arranges \" his \nsymptoms and exploits his neurosis to attain a fictitious \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nPROBLEMS OF MODERN PSYCHOTHERAPY 5z \nimportance ; that even his transference and Ins other \nfixations serve his will to power. and thus represent a \n\" masculme protest \" against a flmcied subJection. Adler \nobviously has his eye on repressed and socially unsuccessful \npeople whose one passion is for self-assertion. These people \nare neurotic because they always imagme themselves \noppressed and t,!t at the windmills of their own fancies, \nthus putting the goal they most desll'e quite out of reach. \nIn essenbals, Adler's method begms at the second stage, \nhe explains the symptoms m the sense Just mdu:ated, and \nto thts extent appeals to the patient's understanding. Yet \n1t lS characteristic of Adler that he does not expect too \nmucb of understanding, but, taking a further step, has \nclearly recognized the need for social education.

The investigator may see in the mud-puddle a world \nfull of wonders, but to the ordinaxy man it is something \nupon which he prefers to tum his back. Just as early \nBuddhism recogmzed no gods because it had to free itself \nfrom an inheritance of nearly two nuihon gods, so must \npsychology, if it is to develop further, renounce so essenttally \nnegative an approach to the unCODSCJ.ous as Freud's. \nThe Adlerian school, with its educabonal intent, begms \nat the very point where Freud leaves off, and thus helps \nthe patient who has learned to see into lumself to .find the \nway to normal hfe It is obviously not enough for hnn to \nknow how and why he fell ill, for to understand the causes \nof an evtl does very httle towards cunng 1t We must \nnever fmget that the crooked paths of a neurosis lead to \nas many obstinate habits, and that, despite any amount \nof understanding, these do not disappear until they are \nreplaced by other habits But habits are only won by \nexefClBe, and appropnate education is the sole means to this \nend. The pabent must be, as it were, prodded mto other \npaths, and this always requires an educatmg will We can \ntherefore see why it is that Adler's approach has found \nfavour cluefly with clergymen and teachers, whtle Freud's \nschool has its advocates among physicians and mtellectuals, \nwho one and all are bad nurses knd educators. \nEvery stage in our psychic development has something \npecuharly final about it. When we have expenenced \ncatharsis with its wholesale confession we feel that we have \nreached our goal at last ; all has come out, all is known, \nevery anxiety has been hved through and every tear shed ; \nnow thinp will go as they ought. After the work of \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nPROBLEMS OF MODERN PSYCHOTHERAPY 53 \nexplanation we are equally persuaded that we now know \nhow the neurOSlS arose. The earhest memories have been \nunearthed, the deepest roots dug up ; the transference was \nnothmg but the wish-fulfilhng fantasy of a child's paradise \nor a regression to the old family situatwn ; the way to a \nnormally dJ.sill.usioned life is now open. But then comes \nthe period of education, which makes us realize that no \nconfession and no amount of explaming will make the \nill-formed tree grow straight, but that 1t must be trained \nwith the gardener's art upon the trellis before normal \nadaptation can be attained. \nThe curious sense of finality which attends every stage of \ndevelopment accounts for the fact that there are people \nusing cath3.I'SlS today who have apparently never heard \nof dream mterpretatzon ; Freudm.ns who do not understand \na word of Adler, and Adlena.ns who do not MSb to hear \nany mention of the unconscious Each is deceived by the \nsense of finality peculiar to the stage of development at which \nhe stands, and thIS gives nse to that confusion of opinions and \nviews wlnch makes 1t so hard for us to find our beanngs. \nBut what causes thIS sense of finality whlch evokes such \nbigoted obstinacy in all directions ;i I can only explain 1t \nto myself on the ground that each stage of development \n1s summed up in a basic truth, and that therefore cases \nfrequently recur which demonstrate this truth m a striking \nway. Our world is so exceedmgly nch in delusions that \na truth is priceless, and no one will let it shp because of \na few exceptions with which 1t cannot be brought into \naccord.

He IS also \na man His thinking, to be sure, may be linuted to his \nspecial field, but in his behaviour be exerts the influence of \na complete human being. Without being clearly conscious \nof 1t or giving it a name, he unwittingly does a great deal in \nthe way of explanation and educa.twn , and other analysts \ndo as much m the way of catharsis without raisjng it to the \nlevel of a principle. \nThe three stages of analytical psychology so far dealt \nwith are by no means of such a nature that the last can \nreplace the first or the second. All three qwte properly \nco•exist and are salient aspects of one and the same \nproblem ; they no more invahdate each other than do \nconfession and absolution. And the same is true of the \nfourth-the stage of transformation · it must not claim to \nbe the finally-achieved and only valid truth. Its part is to \nmake up a deficit left by the previous stages ; it comes to \nmeet an additional and still unsatislied need. \nIn order to make clear what this fourth stage has in view, \nand to throw some light oo the curious term \" trans­\nformation \", we must first take account of those psychic \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nPROBLEMS OF MODERN PSYCHOTHERAPY 55 \nneeds of man which were not given a place in the other \nstages In other words, we must ascertam what could \nseem more desirable or lead further than the claim to be \na normally adapted, social bemg Nothing is more useful \nor fittmg than to be a normal human bemg, but the very \nnotion of a \" normal human being \" suggests a restriction \nto the average-as does also the concept of adaptation. It \nis only a man who, as things stand, already finds it difficult \nto come to terms with the everyday world who can see \nrn t1ns restriction a desirable improvement : a man, let \nus say, whose neurosis unfi.ts him for normal hfe.

    "raw_text": "s6 PROBLEMS OF MODERN PSYCHOTHERAPY \nThe needs and necessities of individuals vary. What sets \none free is for another a prison-as for instance normality \nand adaptation. Although it is a biological dictum that \nman is a herd ammal and 1S only healthy when he lives as \na social being, yet the first case we observe may seem to \nupset this statement, and to prove tha.t man is only healthy \nwhen leading an abnormal and UilSOClBl hfe. It lS a terrible \nmisfortune that practical psychology can offer no generally \nvahd recipes and nonns. There are only individual cases \nwhose needs and demands are totally different-so dtfferent \nthat we really cannot foresee what course a given case will \nfollow. It is therefore WISe of the physician to renounce \nall premature assumptwns. This does not mean that he \nshould throw all 1us assumptions overboard, but that he \nshould regard them in any given case as hypothetical. \nYet it is not the doctor's whole task to mstruct or convince \nhis patient ; he must rather show hun how the doctor \nreacts to hIS particular case. For twist and turn the matter \nas we may, the relation between physician and patient \nremains personal within the frame of the impersonal, \nprofessional treatment. We cannot by any device bring 1t \nabout that the treatment IS not the outcome of a mutual \ninfluence in which the whole being of the patient as well \nas that of the doctor plays its part. Two primary factors \ncome together in the treatment-that is, two persons, \nneither of whom IS a fixed and determmable magnitude. \nTheir fields of consciousness may be quite clearly defined, \nbut they bring with them besides a.n indefinitely extended \nsphere of unconsciousness. For this reason the personalities \nof the doctor and patieot have olteo more to do with the \noutcome of the treatment than what the doctor says or \nthink&-elthough we must not undervalue this latter factor \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nPROBLEMS OF MODERN PSYCHOTHERAPY 57 \nas a disturbing or healing one. The meeting of two per­\nsonahties is hke the contact of two chemical substances : \nif there is any reaction, both are transformed. We should \nexpect the doctor to have an influence on the patient in \nevery effective psychic treatment ; but this influence can \nonly take plaoe when he too is affected by the patient \nYou can exert no mfluence if you are not susceptible to \ninfluence. It is futile for the doctor to shield hmiself from \nthe mfiuence of the patient and to surround lumself with \na smoke-screen of fatherly and professional authority If \nhe does so he merely forbu:ls himself the use of a highly \nimportant organ of information, and the patient inftuences \nbun unCOllSClously none the less. The unconscious changes \nin the doctor which the patient thus bnngs about are well \nknown to many psychotherapists ; they are disturbances, \nor even mJunes, pecuhar to the profession, which illustrate \nin a striking way the patient's almost \" ch.emi.cal \" m.fluence \nOne of the best known of them is the counter-transference \nwhich the transference evokes But the effects are often \nmore subtle, and then- nature is best conveyed by the old \ntdea of the demon of sickness According to this a sufferer \ntransmits lns disease to a healthy person whose powers \nsubdue the demon-but not without a negative mfluence \nupon the well-bemg of the healer. \nIn the relation between doctor and patient we meet with \nmiponderable factors winch bnng about a mutual trans­\nformation In tlus exchange, the more stable and the \nstronger penonahty will decide the :final issue. But I have \nseen many cases in which the patient has proved stronger \nthan the doctor in defiance of all theory and the doctor's \nintention : and where this has happened 1t has most often. \nthough not always, been to the disadvantage of the doctor. \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\n58 PROBLEMS OF MODERN PSYCHOTHERAPY \nThe fact of mutual influence and all that goes with it \nunderhes the stage of transformation More than a quarter \nof a century of wide pracb.cal experience was needed for \nthe clear recognition of these manifestations. Freud lumself \nhas admitted their importance and has therefore seconded \nmy demand that the analyst himself be analysed. \nBut what is the wider meaning of t1us demand ;, It \nmeans nothmg less than that the doctor \" is Just as much \nin analysis \" as the patient. He is as much a part of the \npsychic process of the treatment as is the patient, and is \nequally exposed to the transforming influences Indeed, ll \nthe doctor is more or less inaccessible to this mfluence, he \nis correspondingly robbed of b1S in1lueru:e over the patlent , \nif he 1S influenced only unconsciously, he shows a defect of \nconsciousness w1uch prevents bun from seemg the patient \ncorrectly. In both cases the result of the treatment is \ncompromised. \nThe physicia.n, then, is called upon 1wnself to face that \ntask which he wishes the patient to face. If 1t IS a question \nof becoming socially adapted, he himself must become so-­\nor, in the reverse case, appropnately non-adapted. There \nare of course a thousand different aspects of this reqwrement \nm therapy, according to the mtuatwn in a given case. One \ndoctor beheves in overcoming mfantili.sm---and therefore \nhe must have overcome his own infantlhsm Another \nbelieves in the abreaction of all emotion-and so he must \nhave abreacted all his own emotions A tlurd beheves in \ncomplete consciousness-so that he must have reached an \nadvanced state of consciousness himself. At all events \nthe doctor must cocsistently try to meet h1S own therapeutic \ndemands if he wishes to assure lnmself of a proper in1lueru:e \non his patient.

It \nis the corollary of the demand that the patient transform \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\n6o PROBLEMS OF MODERN PSYCHOTHERAPY \nhimself and thus complete the earlier stages of the treatment. \nThlS challenge to the doctor to transform himself in order \nto effect a change in the patient meets with scant popular \napproval, for three reasons FII'St of all it seems unpractical, \nsecondly, there 18 a prejudice against being occupied with \nOUISe!ves; and tlnr<lly, it is sometimes very painful to make \nomselves hve up to everything that we expect of the pa.bent. \nThis last is the strongest reason for the unpopulanty of the \ndemand that the doctor examine himself , for if he con­\nscientiously \" doctors \" himseli he will soon discover things \nin his mture which are completely opposed to normalization, \nor which continue to haunt lwn in the most disturbing way \nin spite of exhaustive expla.na.tJ.ons and thorough abreaction. \nWhat will he do about these things ;i He always knows \nwhat the patient should do about them-it is 1us professional \nduty to do so. But what will he ID all sincenty do about \nthem when they mvolve himself or perhaps those who stand \nnearest to bun 1 If be ex=es hunseli he will discover \nsome inferior side which bnngs bun dangerously near to \nIns patient and perhaps even bbghts his authonty.

I would rather emphasize what has \nalready been said: that the newest developments of analytical \npsychology confront us with the imponderable elements of \nhuman personality , that we have learned to place in the \nforeground the personality of the doctor himself as a curative \nor harmful factor ; and that we have begun to demand his \nown transformation-the sell-education of the educator. \nEverything that happened to the patient must now happen \nto the doctor, and he must pass through the stages of \nconfess10n, explanation and education so that his personality \nwill not react unfavourably on the patient The physiClall \nmay no longer shp out of his own d1ffi.culbes by treatmg the \ndifficulties of others. He will remember that a man who \nsuffers from a runrung abscess is not fit to perform a surgical \noperatwn. \nJust as the cbscovery of the uncoDSClous shadow-side \nonce forced the school of Freud to deal even with questions \nof religion, so the latest advance of analytical psychology \nmakes an unavmdable problem of the doctor's ethical \nattitude. The self-cnt1C1Sin and self-exammabon demanded \nof htm radically alter our view of the human psyche This \ncannot be grasped from the standpoint of natural SCJ.ence , \n1t IS not only the sufferer but the phySJ.CJaI1 as well ; not \nonly the ob1ect but also the sub1ect , not only a function \nof the bram, but the stne qua non of COllSClousness itseli. \nWhat was formerly a method of mecbca.l treatment now \nbecomes a method of self-education, and therewith the \nhorizon of our modem psychology IS immeasurably widened. \nThe medical chploma is no longer the cruaal thing, but \nhuman quality instead. ThIS is a sigrulicant step. All the \nimplements of psychotherapy developed in clinical piaCtice, \nrefined and systematized, are now put at our service and \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\n62 PROBLEMS OF MODERN PSYCHOTHERAPY \ncan be used for our self-education and self-perfectioning. \nAnalytical psychology IS no longer bound to the consulting­\nroom of the doctor ; its cha.ins have been severed. We \nmight say that it transcends itself, and now advances to \nfill that void which lutherto lu1S marked the psyclrlc \ninsufficiency of Western culture as compared with that of \nthe East. We Oca.dentals had learned to tame and subject \nthe psyche, but we knew nothing about its methodical \ndevelopment and its functions. Our avilization 1S still \nyoung, and we therefore required all the devices of the \nammal-tamer to make the defiant barbarian and the savage \nm us in some measure tractable. But when we reach a \nhlgher cultural level, we must forgo compulsion and tum \nto self-development For tlns we must have knowledge of \na way or a method-and so far we have known of none \nIt seems to me that the findings and experiences of analytical \npsychology can at least provtde a foundation ; for as soon \nas psychotherapy reqmres the self-periectmg of the doctor, \nit is freed from its chm.cal origins and ceases to be a mere \nmethod for treating the SI.Ck. It is now of service to the \nhealthy as well, or at least to those who have a nght to \npsychic health and whose illness IS at most the suffenng \nthat tortures us all. For t1ns reason we may hope to see \nanalytical psychology become of general US&--more eo even \nthan the methods wluch constitute its pre1immary stages \nand which severally carry a general truth But between \nthe realization of thlS hope and the actual present there \nlies an abyss over which no bridge is to be found. We have \nyet to build it stone by stone. \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nlil \nTHE AIMS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY \nIT 1S generally agreed today that neuroses are functional \npsych.le disturbances and are to be cured by psyclnc methods \nof treatment. But when we come to the questions of the \nformation of the neurosis and of the basic pnnciples of \ntherapy, all agreement ends, and we have to acknowledge \nthat we have as yet no fully satisfactory conception of the \nnature of the neuroSIS nor of the pnnc1ples of treahneut \nWlule it 1S true that two trends or schools of thought have \ngamed a special heanng, their teachings by no means exhaust \nthe numerous divergent oprmons that have come to be \nexpressed in our tlDl.e. There are also many non-partisans \nwho, amid the general confhct of opmton, have formulated \ntheu- own vt.eWS If, therefore, we sought to paint a com­\nprehensive picture of the Situation, we should have to match \nupon our palette the subtle colour-gradations of the rambow. \nI would gladly punt such a picture rl 1t lay in my power, \nfor I have always felt the need of comparing the numerous \nviewpoints. I have never succeeded m the long-run m not \ngivmg divergent opmions their due. Such op1mons could \nnever anse---much less secure a following-if they did not \ncorrespond to some special disposition, some special character, \nsome fundamental psycluc expenence that IS more or less \nprevalent. If we were to exclude such opinions as sunply \nwrong and worthless, we should be reiecting this particular \n63 \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\n64 AIMS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY \ndisposition or this particular experience as a misinterpretation \n-that is, we should be doing violence to our own empirical \nmaterial. The wide approval winch greeted Freud's ex­\nplanation of the neuroses in terms of sexual causation, and \nhis view that the happenings m the psyche turn essentially \nupon infantile pleasure and its satisfaction, should be \ninstructive to the psychologist. It shows him that tlns \nmanner of thinlang and feehng comCJdes with a relatively \nwidespread tendency or spiritual current wluch, quite apart \nfrom Freud's theory, has appeared m other places, m other \ncircumstances, in various mmds and m different forms I \nshould call 1t a manifestabon of the collective psyche. Let \nme point first to the works of Havelock Ellis and Auguste \nFore! and the contnbutors to Anthropophyteia; also to \nthe attitude to sexuality in Anglo-Saxon countnes during \nthe post-V1ctonan penod, as well as to the wuiespread \ndiscussion of sexual matters in general hterature which had \nalready set in with the French realists Freud is one of the \nexponents of a present-day psychic prechspoSibon that has \na special lustory of its own ; but for obvious reasons we \ncannot go into that lustory here. \nThe approbation which Adler, no less than Freud, has \nmet with on both SJ.des of the ocean, penruts the same \ninference. It is undemable that a great many people find \nsatisfaction in explaming their troubles m terms of an urge \nto power arising from a sense of mfenonty. Nor can 1t be \ndisputed that thus view accounts for actual psychic happen­\nings which are not given their due m the Freudian system. \nI need hardly mention in detail the forces of the collective \npsyche and the socml factors which underlie the Adlerian \nview and call for precisely this theoretical formulation. \nThese matters are sufficiently obvious. \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nAIMS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 65 \nIt would be an unpardonable error to overlook the element \nof truth in both the Freudian and Adlenan viewpoints, but \nit would be no less unpardonable to take either of them as \nthe sole truth. Both truths correspond to psychic realities. \nThere are actual cases which, m the m.am, are best described \nand explained. by one or other of the two theories. I can \naccuse neither of these investigators of error , on the \ncontra,y, I try to apply both hypotheses as far as possible, \nbecause I fully accept their relative validity. It would \ncertainly never have occurred to me to depart from Freud's \npath ii I had not stumbled upon facts whicli forced me to \nmocb.fy lus theory , and the same IS true of my relation to \nthe Adlerian vtewpomt It seems hardly necessary to add \nthat I hold the truth of my own views to be equally relative, \nand regard myself also as the exponent of a certam pre­\ndispoSltion. \nIt is in applied psychology, ii anywhere, that today we \nshould be modest and grant validity to a number of \napparently contradictory opmions ; for we are still far from \nhaving anything hl<e a thorough knowledge of the human \npsyche, that most challenging field of sc1e0tdic enquiry. \nFor the present we have merely more or less plausible \nopinions that defy reconciliation When, therefore, I \nundertake to present my views in a general way, I hope I \nshall not be misunderstood. I am not recomm.endmg a \nnovel truth ; still less am I heralding an ultimate gospel \nI can speak only of attempts to throw hght upon psychzc \nfacts that are obscure to me, or of efforts to overcome \ntherapeotic drl!iculties. \nAnd it is Just with tlus last question that I should like to \nbegin, smce 1t JS here that we find the most pressmg need \nfor moduica.bons. As is well known, one can get along for \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\n66 AIMS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY \nquite a time with an inadequate theory. but not with in­\nadequate therapeutic methods. In my psychotherapeutic \npractice covering nearly tlurty years, I have met with \na fair number of failures which were far more impres­\nmve to me, than my successes. Almost anybody, from \nthe pnmihve medicine-man and the prayer-healer up, \ncan gain successes in psychotherapy. But the psycho­\ntherapist learns httle or nothing from !us successes. They \nmainly con.firm 1nm in his mistakes, whtle his fa.tlures, on \nthe other hand, are pnceless expenences m that they not \nonly open up the way to a deeper truth, but force bun to \nchange his views and methods. \nI certainly recognize how much my work has been furthered \nfirst by Freud and then by Adler ; and whenever poss1ble \nI apply their standpoints to my prac1lca.l treatment of \npatients. Nevertheless I insist upon the fact that I have \nmet with failures wluch I feel could have been avmded had \nI taken into consideration those empirical data which later \nforced me mto modifications of theU' views It is unpos&ble \nto describe all the situations with which I was confronted, \nand I must content myself with smghng out a few typical \ncases. It was with older patients that I had the greatest \ndifliculties-that is, with persons over forty. In handlmg \nyounger people I generally find the familiar viewpmnts of \nFreud and Adler apphcable enough, for they offer a treat­\nment wluch brings the patient to a certain level of adaptation \nand normahty, apparently without leaving any chsturbing \nalter-effects. With older people, according to my experieoce, \nthis is often not the case. It seems to me that the elements \nof the psyche undergo in the course of life a very marked \ncha.ng&-oo much so, that we may distinguish between a \npsychology of the morning of life and a psychology of its \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nAIMS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 67 \nafternoon. As a rule. the life of a young person is chara.c­\ntenzed by a general unfolding and a strivmg toward concrete \nends ; lus neUI'OSlS, if he develops one, can be traced to his \nhesitation or his shrinking back from this necessity. But \nthe life of an older person lS marked by a contraction of \nforces, by the affirmation of what has been achieved, and \nthe curtailment of further growth. His neurosis comes \nmainly from !us clinging to a youthful attitude wluch is \nnow out of season Just as the youthful neurotic is afraid \nof hfe, so the older one shrinks back from death. What was \na normal goal for the young man, inevitably becomes a \nneurotic hmdrance to the older person In the case of the \nyoung neurotic:, what was once a normal dependence on his \nparents mevitably becomes, through his hesitation to face \nthe world, an incest-relation which is irumical to hfe. It \nmust be remembered that, despite all s:unilar.i.tl.es, res1Stance, \nrepression, transference, \" guuhng fictions \" and so forth, \nhave one meamng when we find them in young people, \nwhtle m older persons they have qU1te another. The auns \nof therapy should uodoubtedly be modrlied to meet tlus \nfact The age of the patient seems to me, therefore, a \nmost 1mportant 1-nd1e1um. \nBut there are also vanous indwia which we should note \nwithm the penod of youth itself Thus, according to my \nview, 1t is a blunder m tecbmque to treat from the Freudian \nstandpoint a patient of the type to whom the Adlerian \npsychology apphes, that is, an unsuccessful peraon wtth an \nmfantile need for self-assertion. Conversely, it would be a \ngross error to force the Adlenan viewpoint upon a successful \nman whose motives can be understood in terms of the \npleasure principle. In doubtful cases the resistances of the \npatient may serve as valuable signposts. I am inclined at \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\n68 AIMS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY \nthe start to take cleep-sested resistances seriously, strange \nas this may sound. For I am convinced thst the doctor \nis not necessarily in a better position to know what is wanted \nthan is the patient's own psychic constitution, which may \nbe quite WlCOIIScious to the patrent himself. This modesty \non the part of the doctor is altogether appropriate in view \nof the situation today Not only have we as yet no generally \nvalid psychology, but what is more, the vanety of psychic \nconshtutions IS untold, and there also exist more or less \nindividual psyches which refuse to fit into any general \nscheme. \nAs to this question of psychic constitution, 1t IS well \nknown thst I postulate two diflereot baSlc attitudes in \naccordance with the typical dJflerences already suspected \nby many students of human nature-the extravertcd and \nthe introverted atbtudes These attitudes also I take to \nbe important ,nd,e,a, as likewise the predominance of \na particular psychic function over other luru:bons. The \ngreat variability of individual hfe necessitates constant \nmodifications of theory which are often applied by the \ndoctor quite unconsciously, but which m principle do not \nat all coincide with his theoretical creed. \nWhile we are on this question of psychic constitution, I \nmust not fall to point out that there are some people whose \nattitude is essentially spintual and others whose attitude \nis essentially materialistic. It must not be assumed that \nsuch an attitude is accidentally acquired or spnngs from \nsome misunderstanding. These attitudes show them.selves \nas ingrained passions which DO criticism or penuasion can \nstamp out ; there are even cases where an apparently \noutspoken materialism has its source in the denial of a \nreligious disposition. Cues of the reverse type are better \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nAIMS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 6g \nknown today, although they are not more frequent than the \nothers. These attitudes also are tttdwu which. m my \nopimon, ought not to be overlooked. \nWhen we use the word ffltlscium it might appear to mean, \nas in medical parlance generally, that this or that treatment \nis inchca.ted.. Perhaps this should be the case, but psycho­\ntherapy has assuredly readied no such degree of certainty \n-for which reason our iflllscsa are unfortunately not much \nmore than mere wammgs against one-Sldedness. \nThe human psyche IS lughly eqmvocal In every single \ncase we must consider the question whether an attitude or \na so-called lusbdus exists in its own right, or is perhaps only \na compensation for the opposite. I must confess that I \nhave so often been mistaken m this matter, that m any \nconcrete case I am at pams to avoul all theoreucal pre­\nsupposibons as to the structure of the neurosJS and as to \nwhat the pat1.e11t can and ought to do. As far as poss1ble, \nI let pure experience decuie the therapeutic aim.s This \nmay perhaps seem strange, because it is usually assumed \nthat the theraplSt should have an aun But it seems to \nme that m psychotherapy especially 1t IS advisable for the \nphyS1C1an not to have too fixed a goal He can scarcely \nknow what is wanted better than do nature and the wtll-to­\nhve of the S1Ck person. The great decisions of human We \nhave as a rule far more to do with the mstincts and other \nmysterious unconscious factors than with conscious will and \nwell-meamng reasonableness The shoe that fits one person \npinches another , there is no recipe for hving that suits \nall cases, Each of us carries bts own life-form-an m­\ndeterminable fotm which cannot be superseded by any \nother. \nNone of these considerations, of course, prevents our \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\n7\" AIJ45 OF PSYCHOTHERAPY \ndoing everything pos511,Je to make the lives of patients \nnormal and reasonable. If this bnngs about a satisfactory \nresult, then we can let it go at that ; but if it is insufficient, \nthen, for better or for worse, the therapist must be guided \nby the data presented through the patient's llnCOllSClOUS. \nHere we must follow nature as a guide, and the course the \nphysician then adopts is less a question of treatment than of \ndeveloping the creative possibilities that lie in the patient \nhimself. \nWhat I have to say begins with the point where treatment \nceases and development sets in. My contnbution to psycho­\ntherapy is confined to those cases in which rati.onal treatment \nyields no satisfactory results. The clinical matenal at my \ndisposal JS of a special nature : new cases are d.ecJ.dedly m \nthe minority. Most of my patients have already gone \nthrough some form of psychotherapeutic treatment, usually \nwith partial or negative results About a tlnrd of my cases \nare suffering from no clinically definable neurOSlS, but from \nthe senselessness and emptiness of thelI' hves It seems to \nme, however, that this can well be descnbed as the general \nneurosis of our tlDle. Fully two-tlurds of my patients have \npassed middle age \nIt is ddlicult to treat patients of this particular kind by \nrational methods, because they are in the mam socially \nwell-adapted mdividuals of considerable ability, to whom \nnormalization means nothing. As for so-called normal \npeople, I am even worse off m their regard, for I have no \nready-made lile-plnlosophy to hand out to them. In the \nmajority of my cases, the resources of consciousness have \nbeen exhausted ; the ordinary expression for this situation \nis : \" I am stuck.\" It is chiefly this fact that forces me to \nlook for hidden possibilities. For I do not koow what to \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nAIMS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 7x \nsay to the patient when he asks me : \" What do you advise 1 \nWhat shall I do ? \" I do not know any better than he. I \nknow only one thmg · that when to my COllSClous outlook \nthere is no pOSSLble way of going ahead, and I am therefore \n\" stuck \", my unconscious will react to the unbearable \nstandstill. \nThis commg to a standstill is a psychic OCCUITeDce so \noften repeated in the evolution of mankind, that it has become \nthe theme of many a fa.uy-tale and myth. We are told of \nthe Open Sesame to the locked door, or of some helpful \narumal who finds the hidden way We might put 1t in this \nway : \" gettmg stuck \" lS a typical event which, m the course \nof tune, has evoked typical reactions and compensations. \nWe may therefore expect With a certain degree of probability \nthat somethmg Slillllar will appear in the reactions of the \nuncoI1SC1ous, as, for exam.pie, m dreams. \nIn such cases, therefore, my attention is chrected more \nparticularly to dreams. ThJ.S is not because I am tied to the \nnotion that dreams must always be called to the rescue, or \nbecause I possess a mystenous dream-theory whr.ch tells me \nhow everything must shape itself , but quite Sllllply from \nperplexity. I do not know where else to go for help, and so \nI try to find 1t m dreams ; these at least present us with \nimages pointing to something or other, and that IS at any \nrate better than nothing. I have no theory about dreams , \nI do not know how dreams anse. I am altogether in doubt \nas to whether my way of bandhng dreams even deserves \nthe mune of \" method \". \nI share all my readers' prejudices against dream inter­\npretation as being the quintessence of uncertainty and \narbitrariness. But. on the other hand, I know that if we \nmeditate on a dream sufficiently long and thoroughly-if \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\n72 AIMS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY \nwe take it about with us and turn it over and over--some­\nthing almost always comes of it. This something is of COUISe \nnot of such a .kmd that we can boast of its scientuic nature \nor rationahze 1t. but it IS a practlcal and important hint \nwluch shows the patient in what direction the unconscious \nis leading bun. I even may not give first importance to the \nquestion whether our study of the dream gives a scientifically \nverifiable result , if I do this, I am following an exclusively \npersonal aim, and one winch is therefore auto-erotic I \nmust content myself with the fact that the result means \nsomething to the patient and sets Ins We into motion again. \nI may allow myself only ono cntenon for the valuhty of my \ninterpretation of the dream-and tlus IS that 1t works. As \nfor my scientmc hobby-my desire to know why it is that \nthe dream works-tlns I must reserve for my spare tune. \nThe contents of the imtial dreams are infimtely varied.­\nI mean those dreams winch the patient relates to me at the \nbeguming of the treatment. In many cases they pomt \ndirectly to the past and bnng to mmd what is forgotten and \nlost to the personality It ,. from these very losses that \none-sidedness results, and this causes the standstill and \nconsequent chsonentabon. In psychologlcal terms, one­\nsuledness may lead to a sudden loss of hb1do. All our \nprevious activities become uninteresting, even senseless, and \nthe goals towards which we strove lose their value. What \nin one person is merely a passing mood may m another \nbecome a chronic condition. In these cases it often happens \nthat other possibilibes of development of the personahty \nlie somewhere or other m the past. and no one, not even the \npa-t. knows about them. But the dream may reveal the \nclue. In other cases the dream points to present facts, as \nfor example marriage or soaa1 posibon, wluch !15ve never \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nAIMS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY 73 \nbeen cODSClOUSly accepted as sources of problems and \nconfhcts. \nThese possibilities fall within the scope of rational explana­\ntion, and it is not difficult to make such imtial dreams \nplaUS1ble. The real difficulty begins when dreams, as is \nofteo the case, do not point to anythmg tangible---e;peaally \nwhen they show a land of foreknowledge of the future. I do \nnot mean that such dreams are necessanly prophetic, but \nthat they anUCJ.pate or \" reconn01tre \". Such dreams \ncontain mkhngs of poss1btht1.es, and therefore can never be \nmade plaUSlble to an outsu:ler. They are often not plaUSJ.ble \neven to me, and then I say to my patients • \" I don't beheve \nit, but follow up the clue\" As I have said, the stunulating \neffect IS the sole cntenon, and 1t 1S by no means necessary \nthat we should understand why such an effect takes place \nTlus lS especially true of dreams contauung mythological \nunages which are sometunes 1ncredlbly strange and baflhng. \nThese dreams contain sometlnng hke \" uncoilSCloUS meta­\nphysics \" , they are expressions of undifferentiated psychic \nact1v1ty wluch may often contain the germs of conscious \nthought.l \nIn a long imtial dream of one of my \" normal \" patients, \nthe illness of h!S S1Ster\"s cluld played an important part. She \nwas a httle girl of two. Some tune before, tlus sister really \nhad lost a boy through illness, but otherwise none of her \nchildren were ill.

Then \nsuddenly it occurred to him that two years earlier he had \ntaken up the study of occultism, and that 1t was thJS which \nhad led him to psychology. The child was evidently his \ninterest m the things of the psyche, an idea wluch I should \nnever have lnt upon of my own accord. Looked at from \nthe mde of theory, this dream-unage can mean anythmg or \nnothing For that matter, does a thing or a fact ever mean \nanything in and of itself;, We can only be sure that 1t is \nalways the human bemg who interprets, that JS, gives \nmeamng to a fact. And that is the gist of the matter for \npsychology.

To me, it is \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\n7fi AIMS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY \nactually the matemally creative side of the masculine spirit. \nWhen all is said and done, we are never proof agamst fantasy. \nIt is true that there are worthless, madequate, morbid and \nunsatisfymg fantasies whose sterile nature will be quickly \nrecognized by every person endowed with common-sense ; \nbut this of course proves nothing against the value of crea.t:J.ve \nimagjnation.

A feature common to all these \npictures is a primitive symbolism which is conspicuous both \nin the drawing and in the colounng The colours are usually \nquite barbanc ID their mtenS1ty ; often, too, an archaic \nquality JS present.

What \nthe aim of this process may be remains at first obscure. \nWe can only remark its important effect upon the conscious \npersonahty. From the fact that the change heightens the \nfeeling for life and maintains the flow of hfe, we must \nconclude that a pecuhar purposefulness is mherent in it. \nWe might perhaps call this a new il1US1on-but what is \nillusion ?

The enigmatic \noneness of the hvmg bemg has as its necessary corollary \nthe fact that bodily traits are not merely physical, nor \nmental tnuts merely psyclnc. The contm111ty of nature \nknows nothing of those antithetical distinctions which the \nhuman intellect IS forced to set up as helps to understanding. \nThe distinctJ.on between mind and body is an artrlicial \ndichotomy, a discnnunatJ.On wluch is unquestionably based \nfar more on the pecuhanty of intellectual understanding \nthan on the nature of things. In fact, so intimate is the \nintemunghng of bodily and psycbic traits that not only \ncan we draw far-reaching inferences as to the constitution \nof the psyche from the conshtut10n of the body, but we can \nalso Infer from psychic pecuhantles the com,spooding bodily \ncharacteristics. It is true that the latter process IS more \ndifficult ; but this is surely not because there is a greater \nmfluence of the body over the mind than mce versc, but for \nquite another reason. In taking the mind as our starting­\npoint we work our way from the relatively unknown to the \nknown ; while in the opposite case we have the advantage of \nstarting from something known, that is, from the VISible \n85 \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\n86 PSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY OF TYPES \nbody. Despite all the psychology we thmk we possess \ntoday. the psyche is still infinitely more obscure to us than \nthe V1S1ble surface of the body. The psyche 19 still a fOl'elgD., \nalmost unexplored country of winch we have only indirect \nknowledge , it is mechated by conscious functions that are \nsubject to almost endless possibilities of deception. \nThis being so, 1t appears safer for us to proceed from the \nouter world inward, from the known to the unknown, from \nthe body to the mind. Therefore all attempts at charac­\nterology have started from the outside world, astrology, \nin ancient tunes, turned even to stellar space m order to \ndetermine those hnes of fate whose beginnmgs are contained \nin man hunseli. To the same class of interpretations from \nootward signs beloog pahrustry, Gall's phreoology, Lavater's \nstody of physiognomy, and more recently, graphology, \nKretschmer's physwlogical study of types and Rorshacb's \nklexographic method. As we can see, there are any number \nof paths lea.ding from without mward, from the physical \nto the psychic, and 1t is necessary that research should follow \nthis directton until certain elementary psychic facts are \nestabhshed with su.ffi.Clellt certainty But once having \nestabhshed these facts, we can reverse the procedure We \ncan then put the question : What are the bodtly correlatives \nof a given psychlc condition ? Unfortunately we are not \nyet far enough advanced to answer this question even \nroughly. The first requirement is to establish the primary \nfacts of psychic hfe, and this has by· no means as yet been \naccomplished. Indeed, we have ooly just begun the work \nof compiling an invento,;y of the p.,ycbe, and our results \nhave not always been successful. \nMerely to estabhsh the fact that certain people have this \nor that appearance is of no significance Jf it does not allow \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nPSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY OF TYPES 87 \nus to infer a psycllic correlahve. We have learned something \nonly when we have determined what mental attnbutes go \nwith a given bodily constitution. The body means as little \nto us without the psyche as the latter without the body. \nWhen we try to denve a psycluc correlative from a physical \ncharacteristic, we are proceeding-i!.S already stated-from \nthe known to the unknown \nI must, unfortunately, stress this point, since psychology \nis the youngest of all the sciences, and therefore the one \nthat suffers most from preconceived opunons. The fact \nthat we have only recently chscovered psychology shows \nplainly enough that 1t has taken us all this hme to make \na clear distinction between ourselves and the contents of \nour minds Until this could be done, 1t was impossible to \nstudy the psyche ob1ectively. Psychology, as a natural \nSCJ.ence, is actually our most recent acqmsition ; up to \nnow it has been just as fantastic and arbitrary as was \nnatural science m the Middle Ages. Heretofore it has been \nthought that psychology could dispense with empmcal data \nand be created as 1t were by decree-a pre1udice under \nwhich we are still labouring. Yet the events of psychic \nlife are what is most 1DUDediate to us, and apparently what \nwe know most about. Indeed, they are more than familiar \nto us, we yawn over them We are amazed at the banahty \nof these everlastmg commonpla.ces ; m short, we actually \nsuffer under the immediacy of our psychic hfe and do \neverything in our power to avoid thinkmg about it. The \npsyche, then, being unmediacy itself, and we norselves \nbeing the psyche, we are almost forced to assume that we \nknow 1t through and through in a way that cannot be \nquestioned. Tlus is why each of us has his own private \nopinion about psychology and is even convinced that he \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\n88 PSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY OF TYPES \nknows more about it than anyone else. Psychiatrists, \nbecause they must struggle with their patients' families and \nguardians whose \" understanding \" is proverbial, are \nperhaps the first as a professional group to become aware \nof that blind prejudice which encourages every man to \ntake himself as his own best authority m psychological \nmatters. But this of course does not prevent the psychiatrist \nalso from becoming a \" know-all \". One of them went so \nfar as to confess : \" There are only two nonnal people in \nthis city-Professor B is the other.\" \nSince this is how matters stand in psychology today, we \nmust adnut that what is closest to us is the very thing we \nknow least about, although it seems to be what we know \nbest of all Furthermore, we must admit that everyone else \nprobably understands us better than we do ourselves. At \nany rate, as a starting-point, this would be a most useful \nheunstlc pnnciple As I have said, it is just because the \npsyche is so close to us that psychology has been discovered \nso late. Being still in its initial stages as a science, we lack \nthe concepts and defimbons with which to grasp the facts. \nIf concepts are la.eking to us, facts are not ; on the contrary \nwe are surrounded-almost buned-by these facts Tins \nIS a stnking contrast to the state of affairs in other sciences \nwhere the facts have first to be unearthed. Here the \nclassifi.cation of primary data results in the fonnation of \ndescnptive concepts covering certam natural orders, as, for \nexample, the grouping of the elements m chemistry and of \ngenera in botany. But it is quite different in the case of \nthe psyche. Here an empirical and descriptive standpoint \nleaves us at the mercy of the unchecked stream of our own \nsubjective experiences, so that whenever any sort of inclusive \ngene:raliation emerges from this welter of impresSions, it \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nPSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY OF TYPES 8g \nis usually nothing more than a symptom Because we \nourselves are psyches, it is almost imposs1ble for us to give \nfree rein to psychic happenings without being practically \ndissolved m them and thus robbed of our ability to recogni,.e \ndistinctions and to make comparisons \nThis is one difficulty The other lies in the circumstance \nthat the more we tum from special phenomtma. and come to \ndeal with the spaceless psyche, the more impossible it \nbecomes to detenmne anything by exact measurement It \nbecomes drllicult even to establish facts If, for example, \nI want to emphasize the unreahty of something, I say that \nI merely thought it. I say : \" I would never even have \nhad thts thought unless so-aod-so had happened , aod \nbesides, I never tiunk things hke that \" Remarks of tins \nkind are qwte usual, and show how nebulous psychic facts \nare, or rather how vague they are on the subjective side-in \nreahty they are Just as obJective and as defirute as historical \nevents. The truth 1s that I actually did thmk thus and thus, \nregardless of the conditions and stipulations I may attach \nto thJ.S fact Many people have to wrestle with themselves in \norder to make th1S perfectly obvious a.dnusston, and it often \ncosts them a great moral effort These, then, are the diffi­\nculties we encounter when we draw inferences about the state \nof affairs in the psyche from the tlnngs we observe outside. \nNow my more hmited field of work is not the clinical \ndetermmation of external characteristics, but the investiga­\ntion and classmcabon of the psychic data which can be \ninferred from them. The first resnlt of this work is a \ndescriptive study of the psyche, winch enables us to formulate \ncertain theones about its structure. From the empirical \napphcation of these theories there is finally developed a \nconception of psychological types. \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\ngo PSYCHOLOGICAL IBEORY OF TYPES \nClinical studies are based upon the description of symptoms, \nand the step from this to the descriptive study of the psyche \nis comparable to the step from a purely symptomatic \npathology to the pathology of the cell and of metabolism. \nThat is to say that the descnptive study of the psyche \nbrings into view those psychic processes in the hinterland \nof the mind which produce the clinical symptoms. As \nwe know, this insight is gained by the apphcatwn of \nanaly1:lcal methods. We have today a substanllal knowledge \nof those psyclnc processes which produce the neurotic \nsymptoms, for our descriptive study of the psyche has \nadvanced far enough to enable us to detemune the com­\nplexes. Whatever else may be takmg place withm the \nobscure recesses of the psyche-and there are notonously \nmany opmions as to this matter-one thmg IS certain· 1t \nis first and foremost the so-called complexes (emotionally \ntoned contents having a certain amount of autonomy) \nwluch play an important part there The expreSSJ.on \n\" autonomous complex \" has often met with oppos:1:b.on, \nalthough. as it seems to me, unJustifiably. The active \ncontents of the unconscious do behave in a way I cannot \ndescribe better than by the word \" autonomous \". The \nterm is used to indicate the fact that the complexes offer \nresistance to the conscious intentions, and come and go \nas they please. Accordmg to our best knowledge about \nthem., complexes are psychic contents wluch are outSlde the \ncontrol of the CODSClOUS mind. They have been spht off \nfrom COllSciousness and lead a separate existence in the \nunconscious, being at all times ready to hmder or to reinforce \nthe conscious intentions. \nA further study of the complexes leads inevitably to the \nproblem of their origin, and as to this a number of chfferent \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nPSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY OF TYPES gr \ntheories are current. Apart from theories, experience shows \nus that complexes always contain something hke a confiict­\nthey are either the cause or the effect of a conflict At \nany rate, the characteristics of confhct-that is, shock, \nupheaval, mental agony, inner stnfe-are pecuhar to the \ncomplexes They have been called in French b&s nou·es, \nwhile we refer to them as .. skeletons in the cupboard \". \nThey are \" vulnerable points \" which we do not like to \nremember and still less to be remmded of by others, but \nwluch frequently come back to mind unbidden and m the \nmost unwelcome fashion They always contam memones, \nwishes, fears, dunes, needs, or views, with which we have \nnever really come to terms, and for t1us reason they con­\nstantly interfere with our conscious life in a disturbing and \nusually a harmful way. \nComplexes obviously represent a land of infenority m \nthe broadest sense-a statement I must at once qualify \nby saying that to have complexes does not necessanly \nindicate mfenonty It only means that somethmg incom­\npa:tJ.ble, unassunilated, and confhcting exists-perhaps as \nan obstacle, but also as a stunulus to greater effort, and so, \nperhaps, as an operung to new po.s51bihtles of acluevement. \nComplexes arc therefore, m this sense, focal or nod.al points \nof psychic We whl.Ch we would not wish to do without. \nIndeed they must not be lackmg, for otherwise psychic \nactivity would come to a fatal standstill. But they inchca.te \nthe unresolved problems of the incliVldual, the points at \nwhich he has suffered a defeat, at least for the time being, \nand where there 1S something he cannot evade or overcome­\nhis weak spots in every sense of the word. \nNow these characteristics of the complex throw a significant \nhght on its genesis. It obviously anses from the clash \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\n92 PSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY OF TYPES \nbetween a requirement of adaptation and the individual's \nconstitutional inability to meet the challeoge. Seen iD this \nbght, the complex is a symptom which helps us to diagnose \nan individual disposition. \nExperience shows us that complexes are infinitely vaned, \nyet careful companson reveals a reJabvely small number of \ntypical primary patterns, all of winch have their origms iD \nthe first experiences of cluldhood. This must necessanly \nbe so. because the individual disposition is already a \nfactor in cluldhood ; it is mnate, and not acquired m the \ncourse of hie. The parental complex IS therefore nothing \nbut the first mamfestation of a clash between reality \nand the mdividual's consbtut1onal inability to meet the \nrequirements 1t demands of bun. The first form of the \ncomplex cannot be other than a parental complex, because \nthe parents are the first reality with which the child comes \ninto con:fhct \nThe existence of a parental complex therefore tells us \nhttle or nothing about the peculiar constitution of the \nindividual. Practical expenence soon teacl!es us that the \ncrux of the matter does not lie in the presence of a parental \ncomplex, but rather iD the spec,al way iD winch the complex \nworks itself out in the hfe of the mdividual. As to t1us we \nobserve the most staking vanations, and only a very small \nnumber can be attnbuted to the speaal traits of parental \ninftuence. There are often several cluldren who are exposed \nto the same mfluence, and yet each reacts to it in a totally \ndifferent way. \nI have turned my attention to these very ditfeteru:es, \nbecause I believe that it is through them that specilically \nmdividual dispositions can be recognized. Why, in a \nneurotic family, does one child react with hysteria, another \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nPSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY OF TYPES 93 \nwith a compulsion neurosis, the third with a psycb.OS1s, and \nthe fourth apparently not at all ' Tlus problem of the \n.. choice oi the neurosis \", with wlnch Freud also was \nconfronted, robs the parental complex as such of all \nztiological meaning, and slnlts the enqwry to the reacting \nindividual and !us special disposi!Jon \nAlthough Freud's attempts to solve tlus problem leave \nme entirely wisatisfied, I am myself unable to answer the \nquesbon.

The oldest attempt \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nPSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY OF TYPES 95 \nof this sort known to us was made by onenW astrologers \nwho devu;ed the so-called trigons of the four elements, air, \nwater, earth and fire The tngon of the all' as it appears \nin a horoscope coDS1Sts of the three \" aerial \" SigDS of the \nzodiac, Aparms, Gemsn, and Lsbra ; the trigon of fire is \nmade up of An'8, Leo and Sagi#anus.

The hst of poss,blhbes \nseems both endless and useless for purposes of classrlication \nI do not know how other people would set about the \ntask. I can therefore only tell you how I myseli have \napproached the matter, and I must submit to the reproach \nthat my way of solving the problem 1S the outcome of my \nmdJ.VJdual prejudice. Indeed, tlus obJecb.on is so entirely \ntrue, that I should not know how to meet it I Illlght, \nperhaps, content myself by refemng to Columbus, who, \nby usmg subjective assumptions, a false hypothesis, and a \nroute abandoned by modem navigation, nevertheless dis-, \ncovered America. Whatever we look at, and however we look \nat it, we see only through our own eyes For this reason \na science JS never made by one man, but by many. The \nindividual merely offers his contribution, and in this sense \nonly do I dare to speak of my way of seeing things. \nMy profession has always forced me to take account of \nthe peculiarities of mdividuals. This has made 11 necessary \nfor me to establish certain average truths, as also has the \ncircumstance that in the course of many years I have had \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nPSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY OF TYPES 97 \nto treat innumerable married couples and have been faced \nwith the task of making the standpoints of husband and \nwife mutually plausible. How many times, for example, \nhave I not had to say : \" Look here, your wife has a very \nactive nature, and it cannot be expected that her whole \nexistence should centre round housekeeping.\" Tlus is the \nbeginning of a type-theory, a sort of statistical truth: there \nare active natures and passive ones. But this time-worn \ntroth did not satisfy me Therefore I next tned to say that \nthere were some persons given to reflection, and others who \nwere unreJlective, because I had observed that apparently \npa.ssive natures are in reality not so mu.eh passive as given \nto forethought They first collSlder a situation and then \nact; and because they do this habitually they miss oppor­\ntunities where immediate actwn without forethought is \ncalled for, thus commg to be sbgm.a:bzed as passive. The \npersons who did not reflect always seemed to me to jump \ninto a situation without any forethought, only per.haps to \nobserve afterwards that they had landed in a swamp. Thus \nthey could be considered \" unreflective \", and this seemed \na more appropnate designation than \"active\". Forethought \nis in certam cases a very unportant form of activity, Just as \nit IS a reasonable course of action m contrast to the \neffervescence of the person who must act at once at all \ncosts. But I very soon discovered that the hesitat:J.on of \nthe one was by no means always forethought, and that the \nqw.ck action of the other was not necessarily want of \nreflection. The hesitation of the former often arises \nfrom habitual timidity, or at least from somethmg like a \ncustomary shrinking backward as if faced with too heavy \na task , while the munediate activity of the second is \nfrequently made possible by a predommatmg self-confidence \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\ng8 PSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY OF TYPES \nwith respect to the object. This observation caused me to \nformulate these typical cbstmctions m the followmg way : \nthere is a whole class of men who at the moment of reactJ.on \nto a given situation at first draw back a little as if with \nan unvoiced \" No\". and only after that are able to react; \nand there is another class who, in the same SJ.tuation. come \nforward with an immediate reaction, apparently confident \nthat their behaviour is obviously right. The former class \nwould therefore be characterized by a certam negative \nrelation to the object, and the latter by a positive \none. \nAs we know, the former class corresponds to the intro­\nverted and the second to the extraverted attitude. But with \nthese two terms in themselves as httle is gamed as when \nMohere's bou,geo1s gennlhomme chscovered that he ordmanly \nspoke m prose. These dISbncbons attam meaning and value \nonly when we realize all the other charactenstJ.cs that go \nwith the type. \nOne cannot be introverted or extraverted without bemg \nso m every respect. By the term. \" introverted \" we mean \nthat all psychic happenmgs take place in the way we posit \nas true of introverted people. Thus also, to estabhsh the \nfact that a certain individual is extraverted would be as \nirrelevant as proving that !us height IS six feet, or that \nhe has brown hair, or is bra.chycephahc. These statements \nbring httle more to hght than the bare fact they express. \nBut the expression •• extraverted '' claims to have more \nmeaning. It states that, when a person is extraverted, his \ncODSC1ousness as well as his unconscious have defimte \nquahties ; that his general behaviour, his relation to people, \nand even the course of his hfe. show certain typical \ncharacteristics. \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nPSYCHOLOGICAL TIIEORY OF TYPES 99 \nIntroversion or extraversion, as a typical attitude, means \nan essential bias which conditions the whole psychic process, \nestablishes the habJ.tual reactions, and thus determines not \nonly the style of behaV10ur, but also the nature of subjective \nexperience. And not only so, but it also denotes the kmd \nof compensatory activity of the unconscious which we m.a.y \nexpect to find. \nWhen the habitual reactions are determined, we can feel \nfatrly certain of havmg h.J.t the mark, because they govern \nexternal behaviour on the one hand, and on the other \nmould specrfic expenence. A certam kmd of behaviour \nbrings correspondmg results, and the subjective under­\nstanding of these results gives nse to the expenences wluch \nm tum mflu.ence behaviour, and thus close the cucle of an \nmdividual's destmy. \nAlthough there need be no doubt that with the habitual \nreactions we touch upon a decl.Slve matter, there remams \nthe dehcate question as to whether we have satisfactorily \ncharactenzed them There can be an honest difference of \nopm1on about tlus even among persons with an equally \nmtuna.te knowledge of the speaal field. In my book on \ntypes ' I have gathered together all that I could find in \nsupport of my conception, but I have made it very clear \nthat I do not hold mine to be the only true or possible \ntype-theory. Thul theory IS S1Inple enough, COOSlSting as \n1t does in the contrast between introversion and extra­\nversJ.on , but sunple formulations are unfortunately most \nopen to doubt They all too easily cover up the actual \ncomplexities, and so deceive us. I speak here from my own \nexperience, for scarcely had I published the first formulatinn \nof my cntena, when I dlscovered to my dismay that somehow \n1 ~ T,t,as, Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner & Co , London \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\n100 PSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY OF TYPES \nor other I had been taken in by it. Something was out of \ngear. I had tned to explain too much in too simple a way, \nas often happens in the first JOY of discovery. \nWhat struck me now was the undeniable fact that while \npeople may be classed as introverts or extraverts, these \ndistinctions do not cover all the diMimilarities between the \nindividuals in either class. So great, indeed, are these \ndifferences that I was forced to doubt whether I had observed. \ncorrectly in the first place. It took nearly ten years of \nobservation and comparison to clear up this doubt. \nThe question as to the great vanatton observable among \nthe members of each class entangled me in unforeseen \nchffi.culties which for a long time I could not master. To \nobserve and recognize the differences gave me comparatively \nlittle trouble, the root of my difficulties being now, as before, \nthe problem of criteria. How was I to find the nght terms \nfor the charactenstic drl'ferences ? Here I realtzed for the \nfirst time and to the full extent how young psychology \nreally is. It is still little more than a chaos of arbitrary \nopiruons, the better part of which seems to have been produced \nin the study and consulting-room by spontaneous generation \nfrom the isolated and therefore J ovian brains of learned \nscholars. Without wishing to be irreverent, I cannot refrain \nfrom confronting the Professor of Psychology with the \nmentahty of women, of the Chinese, and of Australian \nNegroes. Our psychology must embrace all life, otherwise \nwe simply remain enclosed in the Middle Ages. \nI have realized that no sound criteria are to be found in \nthe chaos of contemporary psychology. They have first to \nbe made-not out of whole cloth, of course, but on the basis \nof the invaluable preparatory work done by many men whose \nnames no history of psychology will pass over in silence. \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nPSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY OF TYPES IOI \nWithin the lunits of an essay, I cannot possibly meotion \nall the separate observations that led me to pick out certain \npsychic functions as criteria for the des,gnation of the \ndifferences under discussion. I wish only to show how they \nappear to me as far as I have been able to grasp them. \nWe must realize that an introvert does not simply draw \nback and hesitate before the object, bot that he does so \nin a very definite way, Moreover he does not behave in \nall respects like every other mtrovert, bot in a particular \nmanner. Just as the hon strikes down Ins enemy or bis \nprey with )us fore-paw, in which lus strength resides, and \nnot with his tail like the crocodile, so our habitual reactions \nare normally characterized by the application of our most \ntrustworthy and efficient function ; 1t is an express10D of \nour strength However, this does not prevent our reacting \noccasionally in a way that reveals our specific weakness \nThe predominance of a function leads us to construct or to \nseek out certain situations wlule we avoid others, and \ntherefore to have experiences that are peculiar to us and \ndifferent from those of other people. An intelligent man will \nmake his adaptation to the world through his intelhgence, \nand not in the manner of a sixth-rate pugilist, even though \nnow and then, in a .fit of rage, he may make use of his fists. \nIn the struggle for existence and adaptation everyone \ninstinctively uses his most developed function, which thus \nbecomes the criterion of his habitual reactions \nThe question now becomes · How is it possible to subsume \nall these functions under general concepts, so that they can \nbe distinguished in the welter of merely contingent events 1 \nIn social life a rough grouping of this sort has long ago come \nabout, and as a result we have types like the peasant, the \nworker, the artist, the scholaI, the warrior, and so forth \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\n102 PSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY OF TYPES \ndown the list of the various professions. But this sort of \ntypificabon has very little to do with psychology, because-­\nas a well-known scholar has mahc1ously remarked-there \nare savants who are merely \" intellectual porters \". \nA type-theory must be more subtle. It 1S not enough, \nfor example, to speak of intelligence, for this is too general \nand too vague a concept. Almost any behaviour can be \ncalled intelligent ii 1t works smoothly, quickly, effectively \nand to a purpose. Intelhgence, hke stupidity, 1S not a \nfunction but a modality ; the term tells us nothing more \nthan how a function works. The same holds true of moral \nand zsthetic cntena. We must be able to designate what it \nis that functions outstandingly in the mdividual's habitual \nway of reacting. We are thus forced to resort to something \nwinch at first glance alarmingly resembles the old faculty \npsychology of the eighteeoth century; in reality, however, \nwe are only returmng to current ideas in daily speech, \nperfectly accessible and comprehensible to everyone. When, \nfor mstance, I speak of \"thinking\", it is only the philosopher \nwho does not know what I mean , no layman will find 1t \nincomprehensible. He uses this word every day, and always \nin the same general sense, though it is true enough that he \nis not a little embarrassed. if he is called upon suddenly to \ngive an unequivocal definition of tlunking. The same IS \ntrue of \" memory \" or \" feehng \". However ddlicult it \nis to define such notions scientifically and thus make of \nthem psychological concepts, they are easily intelligible in \ncurrent speech. Speech is a storehouse of uru,ges founded \non experience, and therefore concepts which are too abstract \ndo not easily take root in it, or quickly die out again for \nlack of contact with reality. But thinking and feeling are \nso obtrusively real that every language above the primitive \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nPSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY OF TYPES ro3 \nlevel has aboolutely unmistakable expressions for them­\nWe can therefore be sure that these expressions coincide \nwith perfectly definite psychic facts, no matter what the \nscientificdefinitwns of these complex facts may be Everyone \nknows, for example, what consciousness is, and nobody \ndoubts that the concept covers a definite psychic concht1on, \nhowever far science may be from defining it satisfactonly. \nSo it came about that I simply formed my concepts of \nthe psychic functwns from the notions expressed in current \nspeech, and used them as my cnteria in Judging the dif­\nferences between persons of the same attitude-type For \nexample, I took tlunking as 1t ,s generally understood, \nbecause I was struck by the fact that many persons habitually \ndo more thinkmg than others, and accordingly give more \nwe,ght to thought when making important decmons. They \nalso use then- thinkmg m trying to understand and adapt \nthemselves to the world, and whatever happens to them 1S \nsubjected to COilSlderabon and reflectwn, or at least reconciled \nwith some pnnc1ple sanctioned by thought Other people \nconspicuously neglect thinkmg in favour of emotional \nlactOI11, that is, feehng They mveterately follow a \"pohcy\" \nchctated by feeling, and 1t takes an extraordmary SJ.tuabon \nto make them reflect. These persons exhibit a stnkmg and \nunmistakable contrast to the former Tius difference is \nmost patent when, for example, a person of one kind is the \npartner m business or marriage of a person of the other \nlcind. Now a man may give preference to tlunking whether \nhe be extraverted or introverted, but he always uses it in \nthe way that is characteristic of his attitude-type. \nHowever, the predominance of one or the other of these \nfunctions does not explain all the differences to be found \nWhat I call the thmking or feelmg types embrace two groups \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\n104 PSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY OF TYPES \nof persons who again have something in commm, which I \ncannot designate except by the word rationality. No one \nwill dispute the statemeut that thinking is essentially \nrational, but when we come to feehng, certain objections \nmay be r.used which I do not want simply to overrule ; on \nthe contrary I freely admit that this problem of feeling has \nbeen one over wluch I have racked my brains. Yet, not \nto burden this essay with the various existing defimtions \nof this concept, I shall comine myi;elf briefly to my own \nview. The clue£ di:ffi.culty bes in the fact that the word \n\" feeling \" can be applied in all sorts of different ways \nThis is especially true in the German language, but IS \nnoticeable to some extent m English and French as well \nFmrt of all, then, we must make a careful distmction between \nthe concepts of feeling and sensation, the latter being taken \nto cover the sensory processes And in the !eCOild pia.ce \nwe must recogmze that a feehng of regret 1S something quite \nd,fferent from a \" feeling \" that the weather will change \nor that the price of our alUDUlllum shares will go up. I \nhave therefore proposed using the term \" feeling \" m the \nfirst instance, and dropping it-so far as psychological \ntemunology is concerned-in the other two mstances \nHere we should speak of \" sensation \" when the sense \norgans are involved, and of intuitton if we are deahng with \na kind of perception which cannot be traced directly to \nconscious sensory experience. I have therefore defined \nsensation as perception through conscious sensory processes, \nand intwtion as perception by way of unconscious contents \nUld connections. \nObviously we could argue until Doomsday about the \nfitness of these deftrutions, but the discussion eventually \nturns upon a mere question of tenns. It is as if we debated \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nPSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY OF TYPES zo5 \nwhether to call a certain animal a puma or a mountain-lion, \nwhen all that is needed ts to know what we WISb. to designate \nin a given way. Psychology is an unexplored field of study, \nand its particular idiom must fust be fixed. It 1S well known \nthat temperature can be measured acconling to Reaumur, \nCelsius or Fahrenheit, but we must mdicate which system \nwe are using \nIt is evident, then, that I take feehng as a funcbon in \nitself and distinguish it from sensation and intuition. \nWhoever confuses these last two functions with feehng \nin this narrower sense, can obviously not acknowledge the \nrationality of feeling. But ii they are separated from \nfeehng, it becomes quite clear that feeling values and feehng \nJudgements-that 1s to say, our feelmgs---are not only \nreasonable, but are also as discrinunating, logical and \nconSIStent as thmkmg Such a statement seems strange to \na man of the thmkmg type, but we can understand this when \nwe reahze that tn a person with a differentiated thmkmg \nfunction, the feeling function is always less developed, more \npnnutive, and therefore contaminated with other functions \n-these being preClSely the functions which are not rational, \nnot logical, and not evaluatmg, namely, sensation and \nintmtion. These two last are by their very nature opposed \nto the rational functions When we think, it 1S m order to \nJudge or to reach a conclusion, and when we feel it is in \norder to attach a proper value to something ; sensabon and \nintuit10n, on the other hand, are perceptive-they make us \naware of what is happening, but do not interpret or evaluate \nit. They do not act selectively according to principles, but \nare simply receptive of what happens. But \"what happens\" \nis merely nature, and therefore essentially non-rational. \nThere are no modes of inference by which it can be proved \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\n1o6 PSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY OF TYPES \nthat there must be so many planets, or so many species \noi warm-blooded animals of this or that sort. Lack of \nratlOnahty is a vice where thinking and feeling are called \nfor-rationahty is a vice where sensation and intwtion \nshould be trusted. \nNow there are many persons whose habitual reactions \nare non-rabonal, because they are based chiefly upon \nsensation or intuition. They cannot be based upon both at \nonce, because sensation is just as antagonishc to intuition \nas thinkmg is to feeling When I try to assure myself with \nmy eyes and ears of what actually occurs, I cannot at the \nsame time give way to dreams and fantasies as to what lies \nround the comer. As this is just what the mtuitJ.ve type \nmust do in order to give free play to the unconSC10us or to \nthe obJect, it ts easy to see that the sensation type is at \nthe opposite pole to the mtu11:J.ve Unfortunately, I cannot \nhere take up the interesting vanatlons which the extraverted \nor introverted athtude produces m non-rational types \nInstead, I prefer to add a word about the effects regularly \nproduced upon the other functions when preference 1s given \nto one.

We shall rather restnct ourselves and deal \nonly with certam \" problems \" ; that is, with tlungs that \nare difficult, questionable or ambiguous ; in a word, with \nquestions which allow of more than one answer-and, more­\nover, answers that are always open to doubt For this reason \nthere will be much to which we must add a question-mark \nin our thoughts.

The psychic hie of \ncivilized man, however, is full of problems; we cannot even \nthink of it except in terms of problems.

And where several ways seem possible, there we \nhave tumed away from the certain guidance of mstmct \nand are handed over to fear. For consciousness is now \ncalled upon to do that winch nature has always done for \nher children-namely, to give a certain, unquest10Dable and \nunequivocal decision. And here we are beset by an all-too­\nhuman fear that conscioumess--our Promethean conquest­\nmay in the end not be able to serve us in the place of nature \nProblems thus draw us into an orphaned and isolated \nstate where we are abandoned by nature and are dnven \nto consaousness.

This \nextravagant behaviour is not to be charged to our arrogance, \nbut to the circumstance that man's psyche is a unique \ncombmation of factors wluch also make up the special \nsubjects of far-reaching lines of research. For it is out of \nhimself and out of his peculiar constitution that man \nproduced his scieuces. They are symptoms of his psyche. \nIf, therefore, we ask ourselves the unavoidable queshon : \n\" Why does man, in obvious contrast to the animal world, \nhave problems ? \"-we run mto that Inextricable tangle \nof thoughts which many thousands of mcis1ve mmds have \nbrought about m the course of centuries. I shall not perfonn \nthe labours of a Sisyphus upon this masterpiece of confusion, \nbut will try to present quite simply my contnbution toward \nman's attempt to answer th1S basic question \nThere are no problems without consc10usness. We must \ntherefore put the question in another way · In what way \ndoes consciousness anse l Nobody can say with certamty, \nbut we can observe small children in the process of becoming \nconscious. Every parent ca.n see 1t, If he pays attent10n. \nAnd this is what we are able to observe . when the child \nrecognizes someone or something-when he \" knows ,. a \nperson or a thmg-th.en we feel that the cb.tld has conscious­\nness. That, no doubt, is also why in Paradise 11: was the \ntree of knowledge wluch bore such fateful fruit. \nBut what is recognition or knowledge m tlns sense? We \nspeak of \" knowmg \" sometlung when we succeed m hnlang \na new perception to an already established context m such \na way that we hold in consciousness not only the new \nperception but this context as well. \" Knowing \" is based, \ntherefore, upon a COllSClOUS connection between psychic \ncontents. We cannot have knowledge of disconnected \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nTHE STAGES OF LIFE IIJ \ncontents, and we cannot even be conscious of them. The \nfirst stage of consciousness, then, which we can observe \nconsists in a mere connecb.on between two or more psychic \ncontents. At tlus level, CODSC1ousness is merely sporadic, \nbeing lin11ted to the representation of a few connections, and \nthe content is not remembered later on It is a fact that in \nthe early years of hfe there is no continuous memory ; at \nthe most there are islands of consciousness winch are like \nsingle lamps or lighted ob1ects ID the far-flung darkness \nBut these 1Slands of memory are not the same as those \ninitial connections between psychic contents , they contain \nsomethmg more and something new. Tins somethmg IS \nthat highly tm.portant senes of related contents wluch \nconstitutes the so-called ego. The ego----qwte hke the \nuntial content-senes-1s an obJect m consciousness, and for \ntins reason the chtld speaks of itself at first obJectively, in \nthe tlurd person. Only later, when the ego-contents have \nbeen charged with energy of their own (very hlrely as a \nresult of exercise), does the feehng of subJectJ.vity or \n\"1-ness\" anse. Tins is no doubt the moment when the \nchild begins to speak of itself in the first person At this \nlevel the continuity of memory has its beginning Essentially, \ntherefore, it is a continuity in the ego-memones. \nIn the childJ.sh stage of consciousness there are as yet \nno problems ; nothing depends upon the subject, for the \nchtld itself 18 still wholly dependent upon its parents. It is \nas though 1t were not yet completely born, but were still \nenclosed in the psycluc atmosphere of its parents. Psychic \nbirth, and with it the conscious distinction of the ego from \nthe parents, takes place in the normal course of things at \nthe age of puberty with the eruption of sexual life. The \nphysiological change is attended by a psychic revolution. \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nTHE STAGES OF LIFE \nFor the various bodily manifestations give such an emphasis \nto the ego that it often aMerts itself without stmt or measure. \nThis is sometimes called \" the unbearable age \". \nUntil thts period is reached the psychic life of the individual \nis essentially governed by impulse, and few or no problems \nare met with. Even when external hm1tations oppose the \nsubJecbve impulses, these restraints do not put the mdlvidual \nat variance with lnmself. He submits to them or circumvents \nthem, remaining quite at one with bun.self. He does not yet \nknow the state of inner tenston whi.ch a problem brings \nabout This state only anses when what was an external \nhmitabon becomes an mner obstacle , when one unpulse \nopposes itself to another. Resort.mg to psychological terms \nwe would say the state induced by a problem-the state \nof being at vanance with oneself-a.rues when, side by SJde \nwith the senes of ego-contents, a second senes of equal \nmtensity comes into bemg. This second series, because of \nits energy-value, has a functional significance equal to that \nof the ego-complex; we might call 1t another, second ego \nwhlch in a given case can wrest the leadership from the \nfirst. This bnngs about an estrangement from oneself­\nthe state that betokens a problem. \nWith reference to what was said above we can epitomize \nas follows : the first stage of conscioumess which consists \nof recognizing or \" knowing \" is an anarclnc or chaotic \nstate The second-that of the developed ego--complex­\nis a monarchic or monistic phase. The t1nrd is another step \nforward in consciousness, and CODS1Sts in the awareness of \none's divided state ; it is a dualistic phase. \nAnd here we take up our actual theme, namely the question \nof the stages of hie. First of all we must deal with the \nperiod of youth. It extends roughly from the yeani Just \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nTHE STAGES OF LIFE \nafter puberty to middle life, which itself begins betweeo \nthe thirty-fifth and fortieth year. \nI might well be asked why I choose to begin with the \nsecond penod of human existence. Are there no di:flicult \nquestions connected with childhood ? The complex psychic \nhfe of the cluld is of course a problem of the first magnitude \nto parents, educators and physicians • but when normal, the \nchtld has no real problems of its own. It 1S only when a \nhuman being has grown up that he can have doubts about \nhunself and be at vanance with hunself. \nWe are all thoroughly fam.iha:r with the sources of the \nproblems winch anse m the penod of youth. For most \npeople it is the demands of hfe which harshly put an end \nto the dream of chtldhood If the mdividual is sufficiently \nwell prepared, the transitwn to a professional career may \ntake place smoothly. But 1£ he clmgs to tllus10ns that \ncontradict reahty, then problems will surely anse No one \ntakes the step into life without making certain presup­\nposrb.ons----and occasionally they are false That is, they \nmay not fit the conditwns mto wlnch one is thrown It is \noften a question of exaggerated expectations, of under­\nestimation of ddficulties, of un1ustlfi.ed optmusm or of a \nnegative attitude One could compile quite a hst of the \nfalse presuppositions which give nse to the earliest, conscious \nproblems. \nBut 1t is not always the contrast of subiective presupposi­\ntions with external facts that gives rise to problems, it may as \noften be inner, psychic disturbances. They may exist even \nwhen thmgs run smoothly enough m the outer world. Very \noften it IS the disturbance of the psychic equilibnum by the \nsexual unpulse , and perhaps rust as often 1t is the feeling \nof inferionty wlnch springs from an unbearable seDS1tivity. \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nII6 THE STAGES OF LIFE \nThese inner diffi.culties may exist even when adaptation to \nthe outer world has been achieved without apparent effort. \nIt even seems as ii young people who have had to struggle \nhard for their existence are spared inner problems, while \nthose for whom adaptation for some reason or other is \nmade easy, run into problems of sex or confilcts growing \nfrom the seose of inferiority. \nPeople whose own temperaments offer problems are often \nneurotic, but it 'would be a senous misunderstanding to \nconfuse the existence of problems with neuTI>SIS. There is \na marked distinction between the two 10 that the neurotic \nis 111 because he is unconscious of hlS problems , wlule the \nman with a difficult temperament suffers from bts conscious \nproblems without being ill \nIf we try to extract the common and essential factors \nfrom the almost inexhaustible vanety of individual problems \nfound in the period of youth, we meet in nearly all cases \nwith a particular feature . a more or less patent clinging \nto the childhood level of consciousness-a rebellioo against \nthe fateful forces in and around us which tend to involve \nus in the world. Somet.hing in us WlSh.es to remain a child ; \nto be Ull.COllSClOUS, or, at most, conscious only of the ego ; \nto reject everything foreign, or at least sub1ect it to our \nwill ; to do nothing, or m any case indulge our own craving \nfor pleasure or power. In this leaning we observe somethmg \nhke the inertia of matter ; it is persistence in a lutherto \nexistmg state whose level of consciousness is smaller, \nrumower and more egoistic than that of the dua.hstic stage. \nFor in the latter the individual finds himself compelled to \nrecognize and to accept what is diflereot and strange as a \npart of his owo lile--as a kind of \" also-I \". \nIt is the extension of the horizon of life which is the \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nTHE STAGES OF LIFE \nessential feature of the dualistic stage--<md to wbkh \nresistance is offered. To be sure, this enlargement-or this \ndiastole, to use Goethe's expression-had started long before \ntlus. It begins at birth, when the child abandons the narrow \nconfinement of the mother's womb ; and from then on it \ngains stea.d.Jly until it reaches a critical point in that phase \nwhen, beset by problems, the mdividual begms to struggle \nagainst it. \nWhat would happen to him if he simply changed himself \ninto that other, foreign, \"also-I\", and allowed the earlier \nego to vanish into the past? We might suppose this to be \na quite practJ.Cable course The very aim of religious \neducat10n, from the exhortatlOn to put off the old Adam, \nbackward in bine to the rebnth ntuals of prnrutive races, \nis to transform. a human being into a new-a future-man, \nand to allow the old forms of life to die away. \nPsychology teaches us that, in a certain sense, there is \nnothmg in the psyche that is old, nothmg that can really, \ndefinitively die away. Even Paul was left with a sting in \nhis flesh. Whoever protects lnmself against what ,s new \nand strange and thereby regresses to the past, falls into the \nsame neurotic condition as the man who identtfies himself \nWlth the new and runs away from the past The only \ndifference is that the one has estranged hnnself from the \npast, and the other from the future In principle both are \ndoing the same thing ; they are salvaging a narrow state \nof consciousness. The alternative is to shatter it with the \ntension inherent in the play of opposites-m the dualistic \nslage--imd thereby to build up a state of wider and higher \nconsciousness. \nThis outcome would be ideal if it could be brought about \n1n the second stage of life-but here is the rub.

If I were told that someone bad nvalled Baron \nllliinchausen by aa:omphshing such a feat, I should feel \nsure that his ideas were borrowed ones. \nIt is true that widely accepted ideas are never the personal \nproperty of their so-called author; on the contrary, he 1S \nthe bond-servant of lus ideas.

Ideas \nspring from a source that is not contained within one man's \npersonal life. We do not create them; they create us. To \nbe sure, when we deal in ideas we inevitably make a. con­\nfession, for they bring to the light of day not only the best \nthat in us lies, but our worst insufliciencies and personal \nshortcomings as well. This is especially the case with ideas \nabont psychology. Whence should they come except from \nI3\" \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nFREUD AND JUNG I33 \nthe most sabJectJve side of life ? Can experience with the \nobjective world save us from subJective prejudgements ? \nIs not every experience, even m the best of circumstances, \nto a large extent subJectJ.ve interpretation ? On the other \nhand, the subject also is an objective fact, a piece of the \nworld. What issues from it comes, after all, from the \nuniversal soil, just as the rarest and strangest organism is \nnone the less supported and nounsbed by the earth which \nwe all share in common. It IS precisely the most subjective \nideas which, bemg closest to nature and to the livmg being, \ndeserve to be called the truest. But what is truth ? \nFor the purposes of psychology, I think it best to abandon \nthe notion that we are today in anythmg like a positwn to \nmake statements about the nature of the psyche that are \n\" true \" or \" correct \". The best that we can achieve is \ntrue expression. By true expression I mean an open avowal \nand a detailed presentation of everything that is subjectively \nnoted. One person will stress the fonns into which this \nmaterial can be worked, and will therefore beheve that he \nhas created what he finds within himself. Another will \nlay most weight upon the fact that he plays the part of \nan observer ; he will be conscious of his receptive attitude, \nand msist that his subjective material presents itself \nto him. The truth lies between the two. True expression \nconsists in giving form to what is observed. \nThe modem psychologist, however unbounded his hopes, \ncan hardly claim to have achieved more than the right sort \nof receptivity and a reasonable adequacy of expression. The \npsychology we at present possess is the testimony of a few \nindividuals here and there regarding what they have found \nwithin themselves. The fonn in which they have cast it \nis sometimes adequate and sometimes not. Since each \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\n134 FREUD AND JUNG \nindividual conforms more or less to a type. his testimony \ncan be accepted as a fairly vahd description of a large \nnumber of people. And since those who conform to other \ntypes belong none the less to the human species. we may \nconclude that the descripllon applies, though less fully, to \nthem too. What Freud has to say about sexuality, infanttle \npleasure, and their conflict with the \" pnnc1ple of reahty \", \nas well as what be says about incest and the hke, can be \ntaken as the truest expression of Ins own psychic make-up \nHe has given adequate form to what he has noted m himself. \nI am no opponent of Freud's ; I am merely presented in \nthat bght by his own short-Sightedness aod that of his \npupils. No expenenced psychotherapist can deny haV1Dg met \nwith dozens of cases at least wlnch answer in all essentials \nto Freud's descnphons. By Ins avowal of what he has \nfound in himself, Freud has assisted at the birth of a great \ntruth about man. He has devoted hlS hfe and hts strength \nto the constructlon of a psychology which is a formulation \nof his own being \nOur way of looking at things is conditioned by what we \nare And smce other people are differently constituted, they \nsee tlungs differently and express themselves differently \nAdler, one of Freud's earhest pupils, is a case m pomt. \nWorking with the same empincal matenal as Freud, he \napproached it from a totally different standpoint His way \nof looking a.t things is at least as convincmg as Freud's, \nbecause he also represents a well-known type. I know that \nthe followers of both schools flatly assert that I am in the \nwrong, but I may hope that history and all fair-rmnded \npersons will bear me out Both schools, to my way of \nthinking, deserve reproach for over-emphasizing the patho­\nlogical aspect of life and for interpreting man too exclusively \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nFREUD AND JUNG I35 \nin the light of his defects. A convincing example of this \nin Freud's case is Ins inability to understand religious \nexperience, as is clearly shown in his book : The Future of \nan llltmon. For my part, I prefer to look at man m the \nlight of what in lwn is healthy and sound, and to free the \nsick man from that point of view which colours every page \nFreud has wntten. Freud's teaching is definitely one-sJ.ded \nin that it generalizes from facts that are relevant only to \nneurotic states of mind ; its validity is really confined to \nthose states. Within these Imuts Freud's teaching is true \nand vahd even when it is in error, for error also belongs to \nthe picture, and cames the truth of a true avowal In any \ncase, Freud's is not a psychology of the healthy mind \nThe morbul symptom in Freud's psychology 1s this. it \nis based upon a view of the world that 1S uncnticized, or \neven unconscwus, and this IS apt to narrow the field of \nhuman expenence and understandmg to a constderable \nextent It was a great ID1Stake on Freud's part to turn his \nback on phtlosophy. Not once does he cnticize his premises \nor even the assumpb.ons that underhe his personal outlook. \nYet to do so was necessary, as may be inferred from what \nI have said. above , for had he critJ.cally exa.nnned his \nassumptions, he would never have put Ins pecuha.r mental \ndisposit:aon naively on view, as he has done in The lnte'IP,~ \ntatson of Dreams At all events, he would have had a taste of \nthe difficulties wluch I have met with I have never refused \nthe bitter~sweetdnnk of phtlosophicalcritiCIS1U, but have taken \nit with caution, a little at a tune. All too httle, my opponents \nwill say , almost too much, my own feeling tells me. All \ntoo easily does self-criticism polSOil one's naivete, that \npriceless possession, or rather glft, which no creative man \ncan be without, At any rate, plnlosophical criticism has \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nFREUD AND JUNG \nhelped me to see that every psychology-my own included \n-has the character of a subjective confession. And yet I \nmust prevent my critical powers from destroying my \ncreativeness. I know well enough that every word I utter \ncarries with it something of myself-of my special and \numque self with its particular history and its own particular \nworld. Even when I deal with empui.cal data, I am \nnecessarily speaking about myself. But it is only by \naccepting tlus as inevitable that I can serve the cause of \nman's knowledge of man-the cause which Freud also wished \nto serve, and winch, in spite of everything, he has served. \nKnowledge rests not upon truth alone, but upon error also. \nIt is perhaps here, where the question arises of accepting \nthe fact that every psychological teaching which is the work \nof one man is sub1ectively coloured, that the hne between \nFreud and myself is most sharply drawn. \nA further difference seems to me to consist in this, that \nI try to free myself from all unconscious and therefore \nuncriticized assumptions as to the world m general I say \n\" I try \", for who can be sure that he has freed himself \nfrom all Ins unconscious assumptions ? I try to save myself \nat least from the crassest prejudices, and am therefore \ninchned to recognize all manner of gods provided only that \nthey are active in the hwnan psyche I do not doubt that \nthe natural instmcts or drives are farces of propulsion in \nhuman life, whether we call them sexuality or the will to \npower ; but I also do not doubt that these instincts come \ninto collision with the spirit, for they are contmually \ncolliding with something, and why should not this something \nbe called spirit ? I am far from knowing what spirit is in \nitseH, and equally far from knowing what instincts are. The \none is as mysterious to me as the other, yet I am unable \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nFREUD AND JUNG \nto dismiss the one by explaining it in terms of the other. \nThat would be to treat it as a mere misunderstanding. The \nfact that the earth has only one moon IS not a misunder­\nstand.mg There are no misunderstandings in nature ; they \nare only to be found in the realms that man calls \" under­\nstanding \". Certainly instinct and spirit are beyond my \nunderstanding They are terms that we allow to stand for \npowerful forces whose nature we do not know. \nAs may be seen, I attnbute a positive value to all religlons. \nIn their symbohsm I recognize those figures which I have \nmet with m the dreams and fantasies of my patients In \ntheir moral tea.chi.ngs I see efforts that are the same as or \nsunilar to those made by my patients, when, guided by \ntheir own insight or inspiration, they seek the right way of \ndeahng with the farces of the inner hfe Ceremonial, ntual, \nimtiat1on ntes and ascetic practices, in all their forms and \nvariatwns, interest me profoundly as so many techniques \nfor bringing about a proper relation to these forces. I \nlikewise attribute a po&1bve value to biology, and to the \nemptti.cwn of natural science in general, in wluch I see a \nherculean attempt to understand the human psyche by \napproaching it from the outer world. I regard the gnostic \nreligions as an equally prodigious undertaking in the opposite \ndirection · as an attempt to draw knowledge of the cosmos \nfrom within. In my picture of the world there is a vast \nouter realm and an equally vast inner realm , between these \ntwo stands man, facing now one and now the other, and, \naccordmg to his mood or disposition, taking the one for the \nabsolute truth by denying or sacrificing the other. \nThis picture IS hypothetical, of coUIBe, but it offers a \nhypothesis which is so valuable that I will not give it up. \nI consider it heuristically and empirically verified ; and. \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nnmuo AND JUNG \nwhat is more, it is supported by the consfflSfl gfflffum. \nThis hypothesis certainly came to me from an inner source, \nthough I might imagine that empirical findings had led to \nits discovery. Out of 1t has come my theory of types, and \nalso my reconciliation with views as different from my own \nas those of Freud. \nI see in all happening the play of opposites, and denve \nfrom this conception my idea of psychic energy. I hold \nthat psychic energy involves the play of opposites in much \nthe same way as physical energy involves a drlierence of \npotential, which is to say, the existence of such opposites \nas wann and cold, lngh and low. Freud began by taking \nsexuality as the only psychic dnving power, and only after \nmy break with him did he grant an equal status to other \npsyclu.c activities as well. For my part, I have su.bswned \nthe various psychic drives or forces under the concept of \nenergy in order to av01d the arbitranness of a psychology \nthat deals with drives or impulses alone I therefore speak, \nnot of separate drives or forces, but of .. value intensities \" 1 \nBy what has JUSt been said I do not mean to deny the \nrmportance of sexuality in psychic life, though Freud \nstubbornly maintains that I do deny it.

Common-sense will \nalways return to the fact that sexuahty IS only one of the \nlife-mstmcts---only one of the psycho-physiological functions \n-though one that is without doubt very far-reaching and \nimportant. \nBeyond all question, there is a marked disturbance today \n1 Compare the essay \"On Psyclw:al :Energy \" in C\"\"\"1btffl°'\" lo \n.A.fl#lylUal P~.

It is well known that when we \nhave a bad toothache, we can think of nothing else. The \nsexuahty which Freud describes is unmistakably that sexual \nobsession which shows itself whenever a patient has reached \nthe point where he needs to be forced or tempted out of \na wrong attitude or situation It is an over-emphasized \nsexuality ptled up behind a dam ; and it shrinkll at once to \nnormal proportions as soon as the way to development is \nopened. It is being caught in the old resentments agamst \nparents and relations and m the bonng emotional tangles of \nthe family situation which most often brings about the \ndamming-up of the energies of We And it 1S this stoppage \nwhich shows itself unfailingly in that kind of sexuality which \nis called\" infantile••. It is really not sexuality proper, but \nan unnatural discharge of tensions that belong to qwte \nanother province of life This being so, what is the use of \npaddling about m this flooded country > Surely, straight \nthmkmg will grant that it is more important to open up \ndrainage canals We should try to find, in a change of \nattitude or in new ways of hfe, that difference of potential \nwhich the pent-up energy requires. If this is not achieved \na vicious circle is set up, and this is in fact the menace \nwhich Freudian psychology appears to offer. It points no \nway that leads beyond the mexorable cycle of b10Iogica.l \nevents This hopelessness would drive one to exclaim with \nPaul : \" Wretched man that I am, who wtll dehver me from \nthe body of this death ;, \" And our man of intellect comes \nforward, shakmg his head, and says in Faust's words . \n\" Thou art COllSClOUS only of the single urge \", namely of \nthe fleshly bond leading back to father and mother or \nforward to the children that have sprung from our flesh­\n\" incest \" with the past and \" incest \" with the future, the \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nFREUD AND JUNG \noriginal sin of the perpetuation of the family situation. \nThere is nothing that can free us from this bond except that \noppos1te urge of hfe, the spirit. It IS not the children of \nthe flesh, but the \" children of God \" who know freedom. \nIn Ernst Barlach's ITilgic novel of family hie, De, Tole Tag, \nthe mother-dzm.on says at the end : \" The strange thing \nis that man will not learn that God is h1S father.\" That is \nwhat Freud would never learn, and what all those who \nshare his outlook forlnd themselves to learn. At least, they \nnever find the key to this knowledge. Theology does not \nhelp those who are looking for the key, because theology \ndemands fmth, and faith cannot be made : 1t is in the \ntruest sense a gift of grace. We modems are faced with \nthe necessity of rediscovering the life of the spuit ; we must \nexpenence it anew for ourselves. It is the only way in which \nwe can break the spell that binds us to the cycle of bwlogical \nevents. \nMy position on this question is the third point of difference \nbetween Freud's views and my own Because of it I am \naccused of mysticism. I do not, however, hold myself re­\nsponsible for the fact that man has, everywhere and always, \nspontaneously developed rehgious forms of expression, and \nthat the human psyche from time immemorial has been \nshot through with religious feelings and ideas. Whoever \ncannot see this aspect of the human psyche is blind, and \nwhoever chooses to explain it away, or to \" enlighten\" it \naway, has no sense of reality. Or should we see in the \nfather--complex which shows itself in all the members of \nthe Freudian school, and in its founder as well, convincing \nevidence of any release worth mentioning from the inexorable \nfamily situation 1 This father..:omplex, fanatically defended \nwith such stubbornness and over-sensi:bvity, is a cloak for \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nFREUD AND JUNG \nreligiosity misunderstood ; it is a mysticism expressed in \nterms of biology and the fllJll1!y relatron. As for Freud's \nidea of the .. super-ego \", it is a furtive attempt to smuggle \nin his time-honoured image of Jehovah in the dress of \npsychological theory. When one does things like that, it \nis better to say so openly. For my part, I prefer to call \nthings by the names under which they have always been \nknown. The wheel of history must not be turned back, \nand man's advance toward a spiritual hfe, wb.tch began with \nthe primitive ntes of imtla.tion, must not be denied. It is \npenmssible for science to divide its field of enquiry and to \nset up limited hypotheses, for SCJ.ence must work in that \nway ; but the human psyche may not be pa.rcelled out. It \nis a whole which embraces cODSClousness, and is the mother \nof CODSCiousness. Scientific thought, bemg only one of its \nfunctions, can never exhaust all the poss1bilities of hfe. \nThe psychotherapist must not allow his vim.on to be coloured \nby the glasses of pathology , he must never allow hunself to \nforget that the ailing nund is a human mind, and that, for \nall its ailments, it shares in the whole of the psychic life of \nman. The psychotheraplSt must even be able to admit \nthat the ego is ill for the very reason that 1t 18 cut off from \nthe whole, and has lost its connection with mankind as well \nas with the spirit. The ego is mdeed the \" place of fears \", as \nFreud says in The Ego and the Id, but only so long as it has \nnot returned to the \" father ,. and \" mother \". 1 Freud ship­\nwrecks on the question of Nicodemus . \" Can a man enter \nhis mother's womb a second time and be born again ? \" To \ncompare small things with great, we might say that history \nrepeats itself here, for the question once more comes to the \nfront today in a domestic quaxrel of modem psychology. \n11,,apmtandnature (Tn1111) \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nFREUD AND JUNG \nFor thousands of yea,s, rites of initiation have been \nteaching spiritual rebirth ; yet, strangely enough, man \nforgets again and again the mearring of divine procreation. \nThis is surely no evidence of a strong life of the spint ; and \nyet the penalty of misunderstanding is heavy, for it IS \nnothing less than neurotic decay. embitterment, atrophy and \nstenhty.

Despite this limitation it \nturns out that we have actually widened our theme, because \nit is not only primitive man whose psyclnc processes are \narcluuc. The civilized man of today shows these archaic \nprocesses as well, and not merely in the form of sporadic \n\" throw-backs \" from the level of modem social bfe On \nthe contrary, every civilized human being, whatever Ins \nconscious development, is still an archaic man at the deeper \nlevels of his psyche. Just as the human body connects us \nwith the mammals and displays numerous rehcs of earlier \nevolutionary stages going back even to the reptilian age, so \nthe human psyche is lik:eWISe a product of evolution which, \nwhen followed up to its ongins, shows countless archaic \ntraits. \nWhen first we come into contact with pnnutive peoples \nor read about prurutive mentality in SC1entlfic works, we \ncannot fail to be deeply impressed with the strangeness of \narcluuc man. L~-Bruhl himseH, an authority in the \nfield of the psychology of primitive socieb.es, never weanes \nof msisting upoo the striking difference between the \" pre­\nlogical \" state of mind and our conscious outlook. It seems \nto him, as a civilized man, inexplicable that the primitive \nshould disregard the obvious lessons of expeneoce, should \nflatly deny the most evident causal connections, and instead \nof accountmg for things as accidents or on reasonable \ngrounds, should simply take their \" collective represeota­\ntions\" to be valid offhand. By \"collective representations\" \nLevy-Bruh! means widely curreot ideas whose truth ,s held \nto be seH-evident, such as the primitive ideas regarding \nspirits, witchcraft, the power of medicines, and so forth. \nWhile ii is perfectly understandable to us that people die \nof advanced age or as the result of diseases that are \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nARCHAIC MAN 145 \nrecCJSDi,.ed to be fatal, this IS not the case with primitive \nman, When old persons die, he does not believe it to be \nas a result of age. He argues that there are persons who \nhave grown much older. Likewise, no one dies as the result \nof disease, for there have been other people who recovered \nfrom the same disease, or never contracted it To him, \nthe real explanation is always magic. Eithex a spin! has \nkilled the man, or sorcery bas done so. Many primitive \ntribes recognize death in battle as the only natural death \nStill other tribes regard even death in battle as unnatural, \nhold.mg that the adversary who brought 1t about must \neither have been a sorcerer or have used a channed weapon. \nTins grotesque idea can on occasJ.ons take an even more \n1D1press1ve form. For instance, two anklets were found in \nthe stomach of a crocodile shot by a European The natives \nrecognized the anklets as the property of two women who, \nsome time before, had been devoured by a crocodtle At \nonce the charge of witchcraft was raised, for this qmte \nnatural occurrence, which would never have aroused the \nsuspicions of a European, was given an unexpected inter­\npretation in the light of one of those presuppos1llons which \nLevy-Bruhl calls\" collective representations\" The natives \nsaid that an unknown sorcerer had summoned the crocodile \nand had bidden it to bring him the two women The crocodtle \nhad carried out the command. But what about the anklets \nin the beast's stomach ? The natives maintained that \ncrocodiles never ate people unless bid.den to do so. The \ncrocodile had received the anklets from the sorcerer as \na rewaxd. \nThis stoxy is a perfect example of that capricious way of \naccounting for things which is a feature of the \" pre-logical \" \nstate of mind. We call it pre-logical, because to us socb an \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nARCHAIC MAN \nexplanation seems absolutely illogical. But it only strikes \nus in this way because we start from assumptions wholly \ndifferent from those of primitive man. If we were as con­\nvinced. as he is of the existence of sorcerers and of mystenous \npowers, instead of believing in so-called natural ea.uses, hIS \ninferences would seem to us perfectly reasonable. As a \nmatter of fact, primitive man is no more logical or illogical \nthan we are. lbs presuppos1tJ.ons are not the same as ours, \naud that is what distinguishes him from us. His thinkmg \nand his conduct are based on assumptions other than our \nown. To all that is in any way out of the ordinary and \nthat therefore disturbs, frightens or astomshes 1nm, he \nascribes what we should call a supernatural ongm For \nhim, of course, these things are not supernatural , on the \ncontrary, they belong to his world of expenence We feel \nwe are statmg a natural sequence of events when we say \nthis house was burned down because the llghtmng struck it. \nPnnutive man senses an equally natural sequence when be \nsays · a sorcerer has used the lightmng to set fire to tlus \nparticular house There 1S nothmg whatever wtthm the \nexperience of primitive man-provided. that it is at all \nunusual or unpressive-that will not be accounted for on \nsunw grounds. In explaining things in tins way he is \njust like ourselves : he does not examine Ins assumptions. \nTo hun it is an unquestionable truth that disease and other \nills are caused by spirits or witchcraft, just as for us it is \na foregone conclusion that an illness has a natural cause. \nWe would no more lay it down to sorcery than he to natural \ncauses. His mental activity does not differ in any funda­\nmental way from Olll'S. It is, as I have said, his assumptions \nalone that set hlm apart from ourselves. \nIt is often supposed that primitive mau has other feelings \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nARCHAIC MAN I47 \nthan we, and another moral outlook-that the \" pre­\nlogical \" state of mmd differs from ours in these respects \nalso.

It is absolutely necessary \nthat they should be able to find their way in forests aod \njunglea. Eveo the European, after a short while m Afnca, \nbegins to notice thiop he would never have dreamed of \nnoticing before; he does 1t out of the fear of going hopelessly \nastray in spite of his compass. \nNotlung goes to show that pnmitive man thinks, feels, \nor perceives in a way that differs fundamentaJJy from ours. \nHis psycluc functioning is essentially the same-only his \nprimary assumptions are ddferent Compared to this it \nis a relatively ummportant fact that he has, or seems to \nhave, a smaller area of consciousness than we, and that he \nis not very capable, or is quite incapable, of concentrated \nmental activity. This last, 1t is true, strikes the European \nas strange. For instance, I could never hold a palaver for \nlonger than two hours, Slllce by that time the natives always \ndeclared themselves bred. They said it was too difficult, \naod yet I had only asked quite simple questions in a \ndesultory way. These same natives showed an astonishing \nconcentration and endurance when out hunting or on a \njourney. My letter-carrier, for instance, could nm seventyw \nfive miles at a stretch. I saw a woman in her sixth month \nof _.,ancy, carrying a baby on her back aod smoking a \nlong pipe of tobacco, dance almost the whole night through \nround a blazing fire when the tempera.tare was 95°. without \ncollapaing.

This in itself does not \nimpress us as strange. And yet, when we approach the \nworld of archaic man, we have the feeling of something \nprod,glously strange. As far as I have been able to analyse \nit, this feeling comes maJ.nly from the fact that the primary \nassumptions of archaic man cliff.er essentially hom oun-­\nthat he hves, if I may use the expression, in a different \nworld.

But that lies far from the beaten \ntrack.

There are \nalso chance occurrences, to be sure, but these are merely \naccidental, and we have granted them a causahty of their \nown. Chance occurrences are repellent to the mind that \nlovos order.

The Arab shows them greater \nrespect than we He wntes on every letter lnsha-4llah, \"If \nif please God \", for only then will the letter arrive. In spite \nof our reluctance to adnut chance, and in spite of the fact \nthat events run true to general Jaws, 1t is undeniable that \nwe are always and everywhere exposed to incalculable \naccidents And what is more invisible and arbitrary than \nchance ) What is more unavoidable and more annoying ? \nIf we consider the matter, we might as well say that the \ncausal connection of events according to general laws is \na theory wluch is home out about half the time, while for \nthe rest the demon of chance has his way. A chance \noccurrence also has its natural causes, and we must often \ndiscover to our sorrow that they are commonplace enough. \nIt is not the fact that the cause of the accidents is unknown \nto us that annoys us ; the irritating thing about them is \nthat they befall us here and now in an apparently arbitrary \nway. That is how 1t stokes us. at least. An accident is \nalways irritating. and even the most dyed-m-the-wool \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nARCHAIC MAN \nrationalist may be moved to curse it. However we interpret \nan accidental event, we cannot alter the fact that 1t has \nthe power to affect us The more the conditions of existence \nbecome subject to regulation, the more IS chance excluded \nand the less do we need to protect ourselves against it. \nNone the less, everyone takes account of the pos51bility of \naccidental occurrences, or counts upon them, even though \nthe official \" credo \" does not countenance this belief. \nIt is our assumption, amounting to a positive conviction, \nthat everythmg has causes wluch we call natural and wluch \nwe at least suppose to be perceptible Primitive man, on \nthe other hand, assumes that everything is brought about \nby mvisible, arbitrary power>-in other words, that every­\nthing is chance. Only he does not call it chance, but \nintention. Natural causation is to him a mere semblance \nand not worthy of menhon If three women go to the river \nto draw water, and a crocodile seizes the one m the centre \nand pulls her under, our view of thmgs leads as to the \nverdict that it was pure chance that that particular woman \nwas sewd The fact that the crocodile seized her seems to \nus natural enough, for these beasts occas1onally do eat human \nbeings For primitive man such an explanation completely \nobhterates the facts, and accounts for no aspect of the \nwhole exciting story Archaic ma.n IS right in holdtng our \nview of the matter to be superficial or even absurd, for the \na.cCJ.dent might not have happened and still the same inter­\npretation would fit the case. The prejudice of the European \ndoes not allow bun to see how little he really explains things \nin such a way. \nPrinut1ve man expects more of an explanation. What \nwe call chance is to bun arbitrary power It was therefore \nthe intention of the crocodile--as everyone could observe-\nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nARCHAIC MAN \nto seize the woman who stood between the other two. If it \nhad not had this intention ii would have taken one of the \nothers. But why did the crocodile have this intention 1 \nThese animals do not ordinarily eat human beings. This \nassertion is correct-quite as correct as the statement that \nthere IS no rainfall m the Sahara. Crocodiles are really \ntinnd ammals, and are easily frightened. Considering their \nnumbers, they kill astonishingly few people, and it IS an \nunexpected and unnatural event when they devour a man. \nSuch an event calls for explanation. Of hlS own accord \nthe crocodile would not take a human life. By whom, then, \nwas he ordered to do so 1 \nIt is on the facts of the world around him that primitive \nman bases his verdicts. When the unexpected occurs he \nIS justmably astODIShed and wishes to know the specific \ncauses. To t1us extent he behaves exactly as we do. But \nhe goes further than we. He has one or more theones about \nthe arbitrary power of chance. We say. Nothing but \nchance. He says : Calculating intention. He lays the chief \nstress upon the confusmg and confused breaks m the chain \nof causation-upon those occurrences that fail to show the \ncausal connections which science expects, and that constitute \nthe other half of happenings in general. He has long ago \nadapted bunself to nature in so far as it conforms to general \nlaws ; what he fears is unpredlctable chance whose power \nmak<s him see m it an arlntrary and mcalculable agent. \nHere again he is nght. It is q111te understandable that \neverything on! of the ordinary sbonld frighten him. Ant­\neaters are fairly numerous in the regions south of Mount \nElgon where I stayed for some time. The anteater is a shy, \nnoctumal animal that is rarely seen.

If \nwe .knew of actual cases in wlu.ch water suddenly overcame \nthe force of gravity. such knowledge would ea.use us no \nlittle anxiety. We know that tremendous masses of water \nsurround us, and can easily imagine what would happen \nif water no longer conformed to gravitational law. Tlus is \nthe situation in wluch primitive man finds hunself with \nrespect to the happerungs in his world. He IS thoroughly \nfamiliar with the habits of anteaters, but when one of them \ntransgresses the Jaws of nature 1t acqwres an incalculable \nsphere of actron. Pnmitive man is so strongly impressed \nby things as they are, that a transgreSS10n of the Jaws of his \nworld exposes lwn to unforeseen poss1bihties. Such an \nexcepb.on IS a portent, an omen, comparable to a comet or \nan eclipse.

All \noccurrences that are m any way striking are at once brought \ninto connection with the unusual event For instance, a \nmissionary set up a flagstaff in front of his house so that he \ncould raise the Union Jack on Sundays But this innocent \npleasure cost him dear It was a smgular and disturbmg \naction, and when shortly afterwards a devastating storm \nbroke out, the flagstaff was of course made responsible. \nThis sufficed to start a general uprising against the missionary. \nIt is the regularity of common occurrences that assures \npnmittve man of a sense of security in Ins world Every \nexceptional event seems to 1nm the threatening act of an \narbitrary power that must be expiated. It 1s not only a \nmomentary mterrupbon of the ordinary course of things, \nbut also the portent of other untoward events. \nThis stnkes us as nothing less than absurd inasmuch as \nwe forget how our grandparents and our great-grandparents \nstill felt about the world.

An \nold woman has had a dream, a comet appears in the sky, \nthere is a great fire in the nearest town, and the followmg \nyear a war breaks out. In this way history was always \nwritten from remote antiquity on down to the eighteenth \ncentury. This juxtaposition of facts, so meaningless to \nus, js significant and convincing to primitive man. And, \ncontrary to all expectation, he is right to find it so. His \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nARCHAIC .MAN I55 \npowers of observation can be trusted. From age-old \nexperience he knows that such connections actually exist. \nWhat seems to us a wholly senseless heapmg-up of single, \nhaphazard occurrences-because we pay attention only to \nsingle events and their particular causes-is for primitive \nman a completely logical sequence of omens and of happenings \nindicated by them.

Another has 1t that \"It never rains \nbut it pours.\" Such proverbial wisdom is primitive science. \nThe people believe it and hold it in awe, while the educated \nman smiles at it-nntil something nnusual happens to him. \nI will tell you a disagreeable story. A woman I know was \nawakened one morning by a peculiar tinkhng on her nlght­\ntable. After looking about her for a while she discovered \nthe eause : the rim of her tumbler had snapped oil in a ring \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nARCHAIC MAN 157 \nabout a quarter of an inch wide.

Their effect upon us shows \nthat the prim1t1ve mmd is not yet dead \nPrimitive man's behef in arbitrary power does not arise \nout of thm air, as was always supposed, but is grounded in \nexpenence What we have always called his supenitition is \njustified by the grouping of chance occurrences. There is \na real measure of probabihty that unusual events will \ncoincuie in time and place. We must not forget that our \nexperience is not fully to be trusted in this regard Our \nobservation is inadequate because our pomt of view leads \nus to overlook these matters. For instance, in a serious \nmood it would never occur to us to take the following events \nas a sequence : in the morning a bll\"d files into your room, \nan hour later you witness an acCJ.dent in the street, in the \nafternoon a relative dies. in the evening your cook drops \nthe soup tureen, and, on coming home late at night, you \nfind that you have lost your key. Primitive man would \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nARCHAIC MAN \nnot have overlooked a single item in this chain of events. \nfor every new link would have answered to his expectations \nAnd he is right-he is much more nearly right than we are \nwilling to admit. HIS anxious expectations are justified \nand serve a purpose. Such a day, he holds, is ill-omened, \nand on it nothing should be undertaken. In our world this \nwould be reprehensible superstition, but in the world of \nprimitive man it is highly appropnate shrewdness In \nthat world man is far more exposed to accidents than we \nin our protected. and well-regulated existence When you \nare in the wilderness you dare not take too many chances \nThe European soon comes to appreciate this. \nWhen a Pueblo Indian does not feel m the right mood, \nhe stays away from the men's council When an ane1ent \nRoman stumbled on the threshold as he left his house, he \ngave up hlS plans for the day. This seems to us senseless, \nbut under prinutive conditions of life such an omen inchnes \none at least to be cautious. When I am not in full control \nof myself, my bodily movements may be under a certain \nconstraint ; my attention is easily distracted ; I am some­\nwhat absent-mmded. As a result I knock against sometlung, \nstumble, let something fall or forget something Under \ncivilized conditions these are mere trifles, but in the pnmeval \nforest they mean mortal danger It is fatal to make a false \nstep upon the rain-soaked trunk of a tree that serves as \na bridge high over a river teeming with crocodiles.

It seems to me that \nthe word \"mystical\" is not well chosen. Primitive man does \nnot see anything mystical in these matters, but considers them \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nARCHAIC :MAN \nperfectly natural. It is only we who find anything strange \nabout them, and the reason is that we seem to know nothing \nabout such psychic phenomena.' In reality, however, they \noccur in us too, but we give them more civilized forms of \nexpression. In daily hfe it happens all the time that we \npresume that the psychic processes of other people are the \nsame as ours We suppose that what is p1easmg or desirable \nto us IS the same to others, and that what seems bad to us \nmust also seem bad to them It is only of late that our \ncourts of law have adopted a psychological standpoint and \nadmitted the relativity of gwlt in pronouncing sentence \nUnsoplnsticated people are still moved to rancour by the \ntenet quod lsr.st Jmn non licet bmn.

The world IS still full of bites noires and \nof scapegoats, Just as it formerly teemed with witches and \nwerewolves. \nPsychic proJectwn 1s one of the commonest facts of \npsychology It is the same as that particspat,on mystique \nwhich Levy-Bruhl remarked as a peculiar trait of primitive \nman. We merely give it another name. and as a rule deny \nthat we are guilty of it. Everything that ,s unconscious in \nourselves we discover in our neighbour. and we treat him \na.ccordmgly. We no longer subJect him to the test of drinking \npoison ; we do not bum lum or put the screws on him ; but \nwe injure him by means of moral verdicts pronounced with \nI I.,. d1810C1ation and projecti.on (Tnuu) \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nARCHAIC MAN \nthe deepest conviction. What we combat m him is usually \nour own inferior side. \nThe simple truth is that primitive man is somewhat more \ngiven to projection than we because of the undifferentiated \nstate of his mind and his consequent inability to cnticize \nhimself. Everything to him ,s perfectly objective, and his \nlanguage reflects tlus in a radical way. With a touch of \nhumour we can picture to ourselves a leopard woman. We \noften represent a person as a goose, a cow. a hen, a snake, \nan ox, or an ass As uncomphmentary epithets these images \nare familiar to us all. But when pnmitlve man attributes \na bush-<oul to a person, the polSOil of the moral verdict is \nabsent. Archa.Jc man JS too naturalistic for that , he JS too \nmuch impressed by things as they are to pass Judgement \nreadtly, and is therefore much less prone to do so than we. \nThe Pueblo Indians declared m a matter-of-fact way that I \nbelonged to the Bear Totem-in other words, that I was a \nbear-because I did not come down a ladder frontwards \nlike a man, but backwards, using my hands like a bear. If \na European said that I had the nature of a bear this would \ncome to much the same thing, with perhaps a slightly different \nshade of meaning The theme of the bush-soul, which ~ \nso strange when we meet with it in primitive societies, has \nbecome with us, hke so much else, a mere figure of speech. \nIf we take our metaphors in a concrete way we return to a \nprimitive point of view. For instance we have the medical \nexpression to \" handle a patient \". In concrete terms this \nmeans to Jay the hands upon-to work at with the hands. \nAnd this is precisely what the medicine-man does with his \npatients \nWe find the bush-soul ham to understand because we ue \nbaffled by such a concrete way of looking at things. We \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nARCHAIC MAN I65 \ncannot conceive of a \" soul \" as an entity that emigrates and \ntakes up 1ts abode in a wild ammal When we describe \nsomeone as an a.ss, we do not mean that he is m every respect \nthe quadruped called an ass. We mean that he resembles \naD ass in some particular respect. As far as the person in \nquestion is concerned, we isolate a part of his personality or \npsyche and concrebze this part of him m the image of an \nass. So, for primitive man, the leopard-woman is a human \nbemg, and only her bush-soul is a leopard. Since all un­\nconscwus psychic life is concrete and obJective for archaic \nman, he supposes that a person descnbable as a leopard bas \nthe soul of a leopard. If the concretizing goes further, he \nassumes that such a soul lives in the bush in the form of a \nreal leopard \nThese identifications, brought about by the projection of \npsychic happenings, create a world in which man IS contained \nnot only physically, but psychically as well To a certiun \nextent he coalesces with it. In no way IS he master of tlus \nworld, but rather its component Pnmib.ve man, m Mrica \nfor instance, is still far from the glorification of human \npowers. He does not dream of regardmg hunse1f as the lord \nof creation. His zoological classification does not culminate \nin homo sap,ens, but in the elephant. Next comes the lion, \nthen the python or the crocodile, then man and the lesser \nbeings. It never oocurs to bun that he might be able to rule \nnature ; it is civilized man who strives to dominate nature \nand therefore devotes !us greatest efforts to the discovery of \nnatural causes which will give mm the key to nature's secret \nlaboratory. That is why he strongly resentz the idea of \narbitrary powers and denies them Their existence would \namount to proof that his attempt to dominate nature is \nfutile after all. \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nx66 ARCHAIC MAN \nSumming up, we may say th&t the outstanding trait of \narchaic man 15 his attitude towards the capriciousness of \ncha.nee which he considers a far more important factor m \ncosmic happening than natural causes Chance occurrences \nhave two aspects ; on the one band 1t is • fact that they \ntend to take pla,e in series, and on the other that they \nare endowed with an •-t purposefulness through the \nprojection of unconscious psyclu.c contents-in other words \nby \"pa,tu;,pation myst,qwe \". Arcluuc man, to be sure, \ndoes not draw this dtstinction, for he projects psychic \nhapperungs so completely th•t they coalesce with phymc&I \nevents. An accident seems to him to be an arbitrary and \nintentional act-an interference by an animated bemg­\nbecause he does not rea.hze that unusual events move him \nonly in so far as he invests them with the force of his own \nastonishment or fear. Here, it ts true, we move on treacherous \nground. Is a thing beaut:J.ful because I attnbute beauty to \nit ;i It is well known that great minds have wrestled with \nthe question whether it is the glonous sun that illumines the \nworlds, or whether it is the human eye by VJrtue of its relation \nto the sun. Archaic man beheves 1t to be the sun, and \ncivilized man believes it is the eye-so far, at any rate, as \nhe reflects at all and does not suffer from the disease of \npoets. He must strip nature of psychic attnbutes m order \nto dominate it ; to see his world objectively he must take \nback all bis arcluuc projections. \nIn the priminve world everything has psycluc qualities. \nEverything is endowed with the elements of man's psyche \n-or let us say, of the human psyche, of the collective un­\nconscious, for there is as yet no individual psychic life. Let \nus not forget, in this connection, that what the Christian \nsacrament of baptism purports to do is of the greatest \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nARCHAIC MAN \nimportance for the psychic development of mankind \nBaptism endows the human bemg with a unique soul I \ndo not mean, of course, the bapbsmal rite in itself as a \nmagical act that is effective at one performance. I mean \nthat the idea of baptism hits a man out of lus archaic \nidentification with the world and changes him into a being \nwho stands above 1t. The fact that mankind has risen to \nthe Jevel of this idea is baptism in the deepest sense, for it \nmeans the birth of spiritual man who transcends nature. \nIt is an axiom m the study of the unconscious that every \nrelatively mdependent, psycluc content 1S personified when­\never the opportunity anses. We find the clearest instances \nof this m the hallucmatlons of the insane and in medumusbc \ncommunicat10ns. An mVlSlble person anses wherever and \nwhE'Ilevet an autonomous psyclnc component is proJected \nThis explains the spuitsof anordmary spmtuahstlc9eanceand \nthe ghosts which appear to primitive man. If an rmportant \npsyclnc content is projected upon a human bemg, he becomes \nmana:-that is, endowed with the power of producing unusual \neffects. He or she becomes a sorcerer, a witch, a werewolf, \nor the hlce. The pnm1t1ve belief that the medicine-man \ncatches the souls that have wandered away by mght and \nputs them into cages hke buds, strikingly illustrates this. \nPsychic proJectJ.ons endow the medu:ine-man with mana • \nthey cause arumals, trees and stones to speak , because they \nare psycluc activities, they compel the individual to obey \nthem. For this reason an insane person is hopelessly at the \nmercy of his VO!CeS.

We may expect psychological research, \non the one hand, to explain the formation of a work of art, \nand on the other to reveal the fa.et.ors that make a person \nartistically creative The psychologist is thus faced with \ntwo separate and distinct tasks, and must approach them \nin radically different ways. \nIn the case of the work of art we have to deal with a \nproduct of complicated psychic activities-but a product \nthat is apparently inten'b.onal and consciously shaped In \nthe case of the artist we must deal with the psychic apparatus \nitself. in the first instance we must attempt the psychological \nanalysis of a definitely circumscribed and concrete artistic \nachievement, wmle in the second we must analyse the \nliving and creative human being as a unique personality. \nAlthough these two underta.kmgs are closely related and even \ninterdependent, neither of them can yreld the explanations \nthat are sought by the other. It is of course possible to \ndraw inferences about the artist from the work of art, and \nfllCt! versa, but these inferences are never conclusive. At \nbest they are probable surmises or lucky guesses.

Any reaction to stimulus may be \ncausally explained ; but the creative act, which is the \nabsolute antithesis of mere reaction, will for ever elude the \nhuman understanding. It can only be described in its \nmanifestations ; it can be obscurely sensed, but never \nwholly grasped. Psychology and the study of art will always \nhave to tum to one another for help, and the one will not \ninvalidate the other It IS an important pnnc1ple of \npsychology that psychic events are denvable. It is a \npnnciple in tbe study of art tbat a psychic product is some­\nthing in and for itself-whether the work of art or the \nartist himself IS in question Both princtples are valid in \nspite of their relativity \nTHE WORK OF ART \nThere is a fundamental difference of approach between the \npsychologist's examination of a literary work, and that of \nthe htera.ry critic. What is of decisive 1m.portance and \nvalue for the latter may be quite irrelevant for the former. \nLiterary products of highly dubious merit are often of the \ngreatest interest to the psychologist. For instance, the \nso-called '' psychological novel '' is by no means as rewarding \nfor the psychologist as tbe literaiy-mmded suppose. Con­\nsidered as a whole, such a novel explains ihelf. It has done \nits own work of psychological mterpretation, and the \npsychologist can at most criticize or enlarge upon this. The \nimportant question as to how a. particular author came to \nwrite a particular novel is of coune left unanswered, but I \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nI78 PSYCHOLOGY AND LITERATURE \nwish to reserve this general problem for the second part of \nmy essay. \nThe nowls wbkh are most fruitful IOI the psychologist are \nthose in which the author has not already given a psycho­\nlogical interpretation of his characters, and which therefore \nleave room for analysis and explanation, or even invite it by \nthou: mode of presentation. Good examples of this kind of \nwriting are the novels of Benoit, and English ficbon in the \nmanner of Rider Haggard, mcludmg the vein exploited by \nConan Doyle wbkh yields that most chenshed arbcle of \nmass-production, the detective story Melville's Moby D,ck, \nwhich I consider the greatest American novel, also comes \nwithin this class of writmgs. An excihng narrabve that is \napparently qwte devoid of psychological exposition is just \nwhat interests the psychologist most of all Such a tale is \nbuilt upon a groundwork of implicit psychological assump­\ntions, and, in the measure that the author ts unconscious of \nthem, they reveal theIDSelves, pure and unalloyed, to the \ncritical discernment. In the psychological novel, on the \nother hand, the authOI himself attempts to reshape his \nmatenal so as to raise it from the level of crude contingency \nto that of psychological exposibon and illumination-a \nprocedure which all too often clouds the psychological sig­\nnificance of the work OI hides it from view. It is precisely to \nnovels of this SOit that the layman goes IOI \"psychology\", \nwhile 1t is novels of the other kind that challenge the \npsychologist, IOI he alone can give them deeper meaning. \nI have been speaking in terms of the novel, but I am dealing \nwith a psychological fact wbkh is not restricted to this \nparticulaI fDim of liteiaiy art. We meet with it in the works \nof the poets as well, and are confronted with it when we com­\npare the first and second parts of the Faust drama. The \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nPSYCHOLOGY AND LITERATURE x79 \nlove-tragedy of Gretchen explains itself , there is nothing \nthat the psychologist can add to it that the poet has not \nalready said in better words. The second part, on the other \nhand, calls for explanation. The prodigious richness of the \nimagmative matenal has so overtaxed the poet's formative \npowers that nothing is self-<>Xplanatory and every verse adds \nto the reader's need of an interpretation The two parts of \nFaint illustrate by way of extremes thm psychological \ndistinction between works of literature \nIn order to emphasize the dist:inctwn, I will call the one \nmode of artistic creat:J.on psychologf,cal, and the other \nrnnonary. The psychologlca.l mode deals with matenals \ndrawn from the realm of human consclousness--for instance, \nwith the lessons of hfe, with emotional shocks, the expenence \nof passion aod the cmes of human destiny ID general-all of \nwluch go to make up the conscious life of man, and lus feeling \nlife ID particular. ThIS matenal is psyclncally assinulated \nby the poet, raised from the commonplace to the level of \npoetic experience, and given an expression which forces the \nreadex to greater clanty and depth of human insight by \nbnnging fully mto lus coOSC1ousness what he ordinanly \nevades and overlooks or senses only with a feehng of dull \ndiscomfort The poet's work is an interpretatwn and \nillumination of the contents of consaousness, of the in­\neluctable expenences of human life with its eternally re­\ncurrent sorrow and Joy. He leaves nothmg over for the \npsychologist, unless, 1Ddeed, we expect the latter to expound \nthe reasons for which Faust falls in love with Gretchen. or \nwhich dnve Gretchen to murder her child! Such themes go \nto make up the lot of humankind ; they repeat themselves \nmillions of times and are respoI1S1ble for the monotony of \nthe ~ and of the penal code. No obscurity \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\n18o PSYCHOLOGY AND LITERATURE \nwhatever surrounds them, for they fully explain them­\nselves. \nCountless literary works belong to this class : the many \nnovels dealing with love, the environment, the family, \ncrime and society, as well as didactic poetry, the larger \nnumber of lyrics, and the drama, both tragic and comic. \nWhatever its particular form may be, the psychological \nwork of art always takes its matenals from the vast realm \nof conscious human experience-from the vivid foreground \nof life, we might say I have called this mode of artistic \ncreation psychological because in its activity it nowhere \nuanscends the bounds of psycbolog1cal intelligibility. Every­\nthing that it embraces-the expenence as well as its artistic \nexpression-belong> to the reahn of the understandable \nEven the basic experiences themselves, though non-rational, \nhave nothing strange about them; on the contrary, they \nare that which has been koown from the begmrung of tune­\npassion and its fated outcome, man's subjection to the turns \nof destiny, eternal nature with its beauty and its horror. \nThe profound difference between the first and second pails \nof F•U marks the difference between the psychological and \nthe visionary modes of artistic creation. The latter reverses \nall the conditions of the former. The experience that \nfurnishes the material for artistic expression is no longer \nfamiliar. It is a strange something that derives its existence \nfrom the hinterland of man's mind-that suggests the abyss \nof time separating us from pre-human ages, or evokes a \nsuper-human world of contrasting light and daikoess. It is \na primordial experience which surpasses man's understanding, \nand to which he is therefore in danger of succumbing. The \nvalue and the force of the experience are given by its enor­\nmity. It arises from timeless depths ; it is fureign and cold, \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nPSYCHOLOGY AND LITERATURE 181 \nmany-sided, demomc and grotesque. A grunly ridiculous \nsample of the eternal chaos-a cnmen laesaa ma1~suitis \nhtffllaflU, to use Nietzsche's words-it bursts asunder our \nhuman standards of value and of a:sthetic form The dis-, \nturbmg vision of monstrous and meaningless happenings \nthat in every way exceed the grasp of humao feeling and \ncomprehension makes quite other demands upon the powers \nof the artist than do the expenences of the foreground of \nbfe. These never rend the curtain that veils the cosmos ; \nthey never transcend the bounds of the humanly poss1ble, \nand for tlus reason are readily shaped to the demands of art, \nno matter how great a shock to the individual they may be. \nBut the primordial experiences rend from top to bottom the \ncurtain upon wluch is pa.mted the picture of an ordered \nworld, and allow a glimpse into the unfathomed abyss of \nwhat has not yet become. Is it a vision of other worlds, or \nof the obscuration of the spirit, or of the beginning of things \nbefore the age of man, or of the unborn generations of the \nfuture ;i We cannot say that it is any or none of these \nShaping-re-shaping-\nThe eternal spirit's eternal pastime 1 \nWe find such vision in The Sllepherrl of Hennas, in Dante, \nin the second part of Faust, in Nietzsche's Dionysian \nexuberance, m Wagner's N,belung...,.ng, in Spitteler's \nOIY,,,P,scher FrMhl,ng, in the poetry of William Blake, in \nthe lpne,otonuichsa of the monk Francisco Colonna, and in \nJacob Boehme's philosophic and poetic stammerings.

Tills hst might be greatly extended. \nIn dealing with the psychological mode of arl1Stlc creatloo, \nwe never need ask ourselves what the matenal consists of \nor wha.t it means. But this question forces itself upon us as \nsoon as we come to the visionary mode of creatwn We are \nastonished, taken aback, confused, put on our guard or even \ndisgusted-and we demand commentaries and explanatwns. \nWe are reminded in nothmg of everyday, hwnan hfe, but \nrather of dreams, night-time fean, and the dark recesses of \nthe mind that we somebm.es sense with misgivmg. The \nreading pubhc for the most part repudl&tes this kind of \nwritillg--unless, indeed, it is ooarsely sensatioual-and even \nthe hterary critic feels embarrassed by it. It is true that \nDante and Wagner have smoothed the approach to 1t. The \nvisionary experience is cloaked, in Dante's case, by the \nintroduction of historical facts, and, in that of Wagner, by \nmythological events-so that history and mythology are \nsometimes taken to be the materials with which these poets \nworked. But with neJ.ther of them does the moving force \nand the deeper sigruficance lie there. For both it is con­\ntained in the visionary experience. Rlller Haggard, pardon­\nably enough, lS generally held to be a mere inventor of \nfiction. Yet even with lum the story is pnmarily a means \nof giving expres6lOll to significant matenal. However much \nthe tale may seem to overgrow the cooteot, the latter \noutweighs the former in importance. \nThe obscanty as to the sources of the material in visionary \ncreatinn is very strange, and the exact opposite of what we \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nPSYCHOLOGY AND LITERATURE x83 \nfind in the psychological mode of creation. We are even \nled to suspect that this obscurity is not unintentional. We \nare naturally inclmed to suppose-and Freudian psychology \nencourages us to do so-that some lughly personal expenence \nunderlies tins grotesque darkness. We hope thus to explain \nthese strange glimpoes of chaos and to understand why it \nsometunes seems as though the poet had intentionally con­\ncealed Ins baS1c experience from us. It is only a step from \ntlus way of looking at the matter to the statement that we \nare here deahng with a pathological and neurotic art-a. \nstep which is JUSbfied in so far as the material of the V1Si.onary \ncreator shows certain traits that we find in the fan.tames of \nthe insane The converse also JS true ; we often discover \nm the mental output of psychotic persons a wealth of mean.­\nmg that we should expect rather from the works of a gemus. \nThe psychologist who follows Freud will of course be mchned \nto take the writings in question as a problem in pathology. \nOn the assumption that an jntimate, personal expenence \nunderhes what I call the '' primordial vision ''-an ex­\nperience, that is to say, whk:b. caDDot be accepted by the \nconscious outlook-he will try to account for the curious \nimages of the vision by calhng them covex-figures and by \nsupposmg that they represent an attempted concealment of \nthe basic experience. This, according to his view, might be \nan experience in love which is morally or asthetically \nincompatible with the personahty as a whole or at least \nwith certain fictions of the conscious mind. In order that \nthe poet, through his ego, migbt repress this experience and \nmake it unrecognir.able (unconscious), the whole arsenal of \na pathological fantasy was brought into action. Moreover, \nthis attempt to replace reality by fiction, being unsatisfactory, \nmust be repeated in a long series of creative embodiments. \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nIl!.4 PSYCHOLOGY AND LITERATURE \nThis would explain the prohferation of imaginative forms, all \nmODStrous, demonic, grotesque and perverse. On the one \nhand they are subsbtutes for the unacceptable experience, \nand on the other they help to conceal 1t. \nAlthough a discussion of the poet's personality and psycbi,: \ndisposition belongs strictly to the secood psrt of my essay, I \ncannot avoid talang up in the present connection this \nFreudian view of the VJSi.onary work of art For one thing, \nit has aroused considerable attention. And then 1t is the \nonly well-known attempt that has been ma.de to give a \n\" scientific \" explanatJ.on of the sources of the visionary \nmaterial or to formulate a theory of the psychic processes \nthat underlie this curious mode of artistic creation. I \nassume that my own view of the queshon 1s not well known \nor geoerally undenitood. With this pre1imwary remark, I \nwill now try to present it briefly. \nIf we insist on deriving the V1SJ.on from a personal ex­\nperience, we must treat the former as something secondary­\nas a mere substitute for reality. The result is that we strip \nthe vision of its primordial quality and take it as nothmg but \na symptom. The pf081UU1t chaos theo shrinks to the pro­\nportions of a psychic chsturbaoce. With tlus accouot of \nthe matter we feel reassured. and tum again to our picture \nof a well-ordered cosmos. Since we are practical and \nreasonable, we do not expect the cosmos to be perfect ; we \naccept these unavmdable imperfections which we call \nabnormalities and diseases, and we take it for granted that \nhuman nature is not exempt from them. The frighteniog \nrevelation of abysses that defy the human underatandiDg is \ndismissed as illusioo, and the poet is regarded as a victim and \npetpe!Iator of deception. Even to the poet, his primordial \nexperience was \" human-all too human \", to such a degree \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nPSYCHOLOGY AND LITERATURE 185 \nthat he could not face its meaning but had to conceal it \nfrom himself. \nWe shall do well, I think, to make fully exphcit all the \nimplica.b.ons of that way of accounting for artistic creation \nwhich COllSISts in reducmg it to personal factors. We should \nsee clearly where it leads. The troth is that it takes us away \nfrom the psychological study of the work of art, and confronts \nus with the psycluc dispomtion of the poet hnnself. That \nthe latter presents an important problem is not to be denied, \nbut the work of art is somethmg in its own nght, and may \nnot be conjured away. The question of the sjgnificance to \nthe poet of lus own creative work-of his regarding it as a \ntrifle, as a screen, as a source of suffenng or as an achieve­\nment-does not concern us at the moment, our task being \nto interpret the work of art psychologically For this \nundertaking it is essential that we give senous consideration \nto the basic expenence that underlies it-namely, to the \nvision. We must take 1t at least as seriously as we do the \nexpenences that underlie the psychological mode of artistic \ncreatwn, and no one doubts thst they are both real and \nsenous It looks, mdeed, as 1f the visionary experience were \nsomething quite apart from the ordinary lot of man, and for \nthis reason we have difficulty in believing that it is real. It \nhas about it an unfortunate suggestion of obscure meta­\nphymcs and of occultum, so that we feel called upon to \nintervene in the name of a well-mtentioned reasonableness. \nOur conclusion is that it would be better not to take such \nthings too seriously, rest the world revert again to a be­\nnighted superstition. We may, of course, have a predilection \nfor the occult ; but ordinarily we dismiss the visionary \nexperience as the outcome of a rich fantasy or of a poetic \nmood-thst is to say, as a kind of poetic licence psycho-\nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nI86 PSYCHOLOGY AND LITERATURE \nlogi<ally understood. Certain of the poets encourage this \ninterpretation m order to put a wholesome distance between \nthemselves and their work. Spitteler, for example, stoutly \nmaintained tha.t it was one and the same whether the poet \nSIIDll of an Olympian Spring or to the theme : \" May is \nhere I \" The truth is that poets are human beings. and that \nwhat a poet has to say about his work is often far from being \nthe most illwmnating word on the sub1ect. What is required \nof us, theo, is nothing less than to defend the importance of \nthe visionary expenence against the poet hunself. \nIt cannot be denied that we catch the reverberations of \nan initial love-<0xperience in Tiu Siupherd of Hmnas, in the \nDsvs,u Com&ly and m the FtNSI drama-an experience \nwinch is completed and fulfilled by the vision. There is no \ngrouod for the assumption that the second part of F•wsl \nrepudiates or conceals the normal, human experience of the \nfirst part, nor are we Justified in supposing that Goethe was \nnormal at the tune when he wrote Part I, but ma neurotic \nstate of mind when he composed P•rl 11 Hennas, Dante \nand Goethe can be taken as three steps m a sequence covering \nnearly two thousand years of human development, and in \neach of them we find the personal Jove.episode not only \nconnected with the weightier visionary experieoce, but \nfrankly subordinated to it. On the strength of this evidence \nwhich is furnished by the work of art itself and which throws \nout of court the question of the poet's particular psychic \ndispomtion, we must admit that the vision represents a \ndeeper and more impressive experience than human passion. \nIn works of art of this nature-and we must never confuse \nthem with the artist as a person-we cannot doubt that the \nvision is a genuine, primordial experieru:e, regardless of \nwha.t reason-mongers may say. The vision is not something \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nPSYCHOLOGY AND LITERATURE 187 \nderived or secondary, and it is not a symptom of somethiDg \nelse. It is true symbolic expression-that is, the expression \nof something existent m its own right, but IIDperfectly known. \nThe love-episode ,s a real experience really sulfeied, and the \nsame statement apphes to the vision. We need not try to \ndetermine whetheI the content of the vision is of a physical, \npsychic or metaphysical nature. In itself it has psychic \nreality, and this is no less real than physical reality. Human \npass1on falls within the sphere of CODSC10US experience, \nwhile the subject of the vision lies beyond 1t. Through our \nfeehngs we experience the known, but our intuitions pmnt \nto thmgs that are unknown and hidden-that by their very \nnature are secret. If ever they become conSC10us, they are \nintentionally kept back and concealed, for which reason they \nhave been regarded from earliest times as mysterious, \nuncanny and deceptive. They are hidden from the scrutiny of \nman, and he also hides hunself lrom them out of <ie,sula,. \nmonui He protects hunse1f with the slueld of science and the \nannour of reason.

However dark this nocturnal \nworld may be, it is not wholly unfamiliar. Man has known \nof it from time immemorial-here, there, and everywhere ; \nfor primitive man today it is an unquestronable part of his \npicture of the cosmos. It 1S only we who have repudiated it \nbecause of our fear of supers'b.tJ.on and metaphysics, and \nbecause we strive to construct a conscions world that is \nsafe and manageable m that natural law holds 10 it the \nplace of statute law in a commonwealth. Yet, even in our \nnndst, the poet now and then catches sight of the figures \nthat people the mght-world-the spirits, demoos and gods. \nHe knows that a purposiveness out-reaching human ends is \nthe life-giving secret for man ; he has a presentunent of \nincomprehensible happenings in the pleroma In short, he \nsees something of that psycluc world that stnkes terror into \nthe savage and the barbsrlan. \nFrom the very first beginnings of human society onward \nman's efforts to give his vague intimations a binding form \nhave left their traces. Even m the Rhodesian chf!-drawings \nof the Old Stone Age there appears, side by Side with the \nmost amazingly hie-like representations of animals, an \nabstract pattern-a double cross contained in a circle. This \ndes,gn has tumed up in every cultural region, more or less, \nand we find it today not only in Christian churches, but in \nTibetan monasteries as well. It is the so-called sun-wheel, \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nPSYCHOLOGY AND LITERATURE 189 \nand as it dates from a time when no one had thought of \nwheels as a mechamcal device, it cannot have had its source \nin any experience of the external world. It is rather a symbol \nthat stands for a psychic happening ; it covers an experience \nof the inner world, and is no doubt as hfehke a representation \nas the famous rhinoceros with the tick-birds on its back. \nThere has never been a primitive culture that did not possess \na system of secret tea.chmg, and in many cultures this system \nIS highly developed. The men's councils and the totem-clans \npreserve thIS teaching about hidden things that lie apart from \nman's daytune existence-things which, from primeval \nt1Ines, have always constituted lns most vital experiences \nKnowledge about them is handed on to younger men in the \nntes of lllltlation. The mystenes of the Gra:co-Roman \nworld performed the same office, and the rich mythology of \nanhqmty is a relic of such experiences in the earhest stages \nof human development. \nIt is therefore to be expected of the poet that he will \nresort to mythology in order to give his experience its most \nfittmg expression. It would be a senous mistake to suppose \nthat he works with materials received at second-hand The \npnmonhal expenence is the source of his creativeness ; 1t \ncannot be fathomed, and therefore requires mythological \nimagery to give it form In itself it offers no words or \nimages, for it is a vision seen \"as in a glass, darkly\". It \nis merely a deep presentunent that strives to find expression. \nIt is hke a whirlwmd that seizes everything within reach \nand, by carrying it aloft, assumes a visible shape. Since \nthe particular expression can never exhaust the possibilities \nof the vision, but falls far short of 1t in richness of content, \nthe poet must have at his disposal a huge store of materials \nif he is to communicate even a few of his mtuna.tions. What \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\n190 PSYCHOLOGY AND LITERATURE \nis more, he must resort to an imagery that is difficult to \nhandle and full of contradictions in order to express the \nweiid paradoxicality of ms vision. Dante's presentunents \nare clothed in images that run the gamut of Heaven and \nHell ; Goethe must bring in the Blocksberg and the infernal \nregions of Greek antiquity; Wagner needs the whole body \nof Nordic myth; Nietzsche returns to the hieratic style and \nrecreates the legendary seer of prehistoric tunes , Blake \ninvents for himself mdescribable figures, and Spitteler \nborrows old names for new creatures of the imagmation. \nAnd no intermediate step is missing in the whole range from \nthe ineffably sublime to the perwrsely grotesque. \nPsychology can do nothing towards the elucidation of this \ncolourful unagery except bring together materials for com­\nparison and offer a terminology for its discussion. According \nto this terminology. that which appears in the vision is the \ncollective unconscious. We mean by collective nnconscious, \na certain psychic disposition shaped by the forces of heredity ; \nfrom it consciousness has developed. In the physical \nstructure of the body we find traces of earlier stages of \nevolution, and we may expect the human psyche also to \nconform in its make-up to the law of phylogeny. It lS a \nfact that in eclipses of consciousness-in dreams, narcotic \nstates and cases of msanity-there come to the surface \npsychic products or contents that show all the traits of \nprimitive levels of psychic development. The unages \nthemselves are sometimes of such a prim1bve character that \nwe might suppose them derived from ancient, esoteric \nteachiog. Mythological themes clothed in modern dress also \nfrequently appear. What is of particular importance for \nthe study of literature in these maoifestations of the \ncollective unconscions is that they are compensatory to the \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nPSYCHOLOGY AND LITERATURE 191 \nconscious attitude. Tius is to say that they can bring a \none-sided, abnormal, or dangerous state of coDSC1ousness \ninto equihbnum in an apparently purposive way. In dreams \nwe can see tins process very clearly in its positive aspect. \nIn cases of msanity the compensatory process is often \nperfectly obvious, but takes a negative fonn There are \npersons, for instance, who have anxiously shut themselves \noff from all the world only to discover one day that their \nmost 1ntunate secrets are known and talked about by \neveryone.I \nIf we consider Goethe's Faust, and leave aside the \npossibihty that 1t is compensatory to 1us own conscious \nattitude, the questJ.on that we must answer is this : In \nwhat relation does tt stand to the conscious outlook of 1us \ntune ; Great poetry draws its strength from the life of \nmankmd, and we completely miss its meaning if we try to \ndenve 1t from personal. factors Whenever the collective \nunconscious becomes a living expenence and is brought to \nbear upon the conscious outlook of an age, this event is a \ncreative act which is of importance to everyone living m that \nage. A work of art is produced that contains what may \ntruthfully be called a message to generations of men. So \nFaust touches something in the soul of every German So \nalso Dante's fame is IDllDortal, while Th, Shepherd of Hemras \nJUSt failed of inclusion m the New Testament canon. Every \nperiod has its bias, its particular prejudice and its psychic \nailment. An epoch is like an individual ; it has its own \nlimitations of conscious outlook, and therefore requu-es a \ncompensatory adjustment. This is effected by the collective \nunconscious m that a poet, a seer or a leader allows himseli \n1 See my article \"Mmd and the Earth\". m Conmlni:t,ot1s to .d1111lytm1l \nP1vd1ology Kllpn Paul, Trench, Trubner & Co, London, 1g.z8 \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nxga PSYCHOLOGY AND LITERATURE \nto be guided by the unexpressed desire of his times and shows \nthe way, by word or deed, to the attainment of that winch \neveryone blindly craves and expects-whether this attain­\nment results m good or evil, the healing of an epoc:h or 1ts \ndestruct:J.on. \nIt is always dangerous to speak of one's own times, because \nwhat is at stake in the present is too vast for comprehension. \nA few hints must therefore suffice. Francesco Colorma's \nbook is cast in the form of a dream, and is the apotheosis of \nnatural love taken as a human relation , without countenanc­\ning a wtld mdulgence of the senses, he leaves completely \naside the Cbnstian sacrament of marriage. The book was \nwntten in 1453. R1<ier Haggard, whose life coincides WJ.th \nthe flowenng-time of the Victorian era, takes up this subJect \nand deals with it m lus own way ; he does not cast 1t m the \nform of a dream, but allows us to feel the tension of moral \nconfhct. Goethe weaves the theme of Gretchen-Helen­\nMater-Gloriosa hl<e a red thread into the colourful tapest,y \nof Faust. Nietzsche proclaims the death of God, and \nSpitteler transforms the waxmg and waning of the gods mto \na myth of the seasons. Whatever his importance, each of \nthese poets speaks with the V01CO of thousands and ten \nthousands, foretelling ~ in the conscious outlook of \nIns time. \nII \nTHE POET \nCreativeness, hke the freedom of the wtll, contains a secret. \nThe psychologist can describe both these manifestations as \nprocesses, but he can find no solution of the philosophical \nproblems they offer. Creative man is a nddle that we \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nPSYCHOLOGY AND LITERATURE r93 \nmay try to answer in various ways, but always in vain, \na truth that has not prevented modem psychology from \nturning now and again to the question of the artist and his \nart Freud thought that he had found a key in his procedure \nof deriving the work of art from the personal expenences of \nthe artist. 1 It is true that certain poss1bthties lay in this \ndirection, for 1t was conceivable that a work of art, no less \nthan a neurosis, might be traced back to those knots in \npsycluc life that we call the complexes It was FieUd's \ngreat discovery that neuroses have a causal ongin m the \npsychic realm-that they take thell' nse from emotwnal \nstates and from real or l.Dlagllled childhood expenences. \nCertain of his followers, hke Rank aod Stekel, have taken \nup related hnes of enquuy and have achieved important \nresolts It is undemable that the poet's psycluc disposition \npermeates Ins work root and branch Nor is there anythmg \nnew Ill the statement that personal factors laigely inllueoce \nthe poet's ch01ce and use of his matenals. Credit, however, \nmust certamly be given to the Freudian school for showing \nhow far-reaching tlus mfluence is and 1n what cunous ways \nit comes to expression \nFreud takes the neurosis as a substitute for a direct \nmeans of gratJ.ficatJ.on He therefore regards 1t as something \nmappropnate-a mistake, a dodge, an excuse, a voluntary \nblmdness.

And a work of art is \nbrought into questionable proximity with the neurosis \nwhen it 1S taken as something wluch can be analysed in \n1 See Freud's ea-.y OD Jemen.'1 G,..~ 1111d OD Leonardo da Vlnm. \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nr94 PSYCHOLOGY AND LITERATURE \nterms of the poet's represswns. In a sense it finds itself in \ngood company, for rehgion and philosophy are regarded in \nthe same light by Freudian psychology. No objectioo can \nbe raised if it is admitted that this approach amounts to \nnothing more than the elucidation of those persooal deter­\nminants without which a work of art is unthinkable. But \nshould the claim be made that such an analysis accounts for \nthe work of art itself, then a categorical denial is called for. \nThe personal idiosyncrasies that creep into a work of art \nare not essential ; in fact, the more we have to cope with \nthese peculia.rities, the less is 1t a question of art. What is \nessenbal in a work of art is that 1t should rise far above the \nrealm of persooal life and speak from the spirit and heart of \nthe poet as man to the spirit and heart of mankind The \npersonal aspect 1s a furutation-a.nd even a SID-in the realm \nof art Wheo a form of \" art \" IS primarily persooal it \ndeserves to be treated as i:f it were a neurosis There may be \nsome vahdity in the idea held by the Freudian school that \nartists without excepb.on are narcissistic-by which is \nmeant that they are undewloped persoos with infantile and \nauto-erotic traits The statement is only valid, however, \nfor the artist as a person, and has nothing to do with the \nman as an artist. In bis capacity of artist he is neither \nauto-erotic, nor hetero-erotic, nor erotic in any sense. He \nis objective and impersonal-even inhuman-for as an \nartist he is his work, and not a human being. \nEvery creative person is a duality or a synthesis of con­\ntradictory aptitudes. On the one side he is a human being \nwith a personal life, while on the other side he is an im­\npersooal, creative process. Since as a human being he may \nbe 10t1Dd or morbid, we must look at Ins psychic make-up \nto line! the determinants of his persooality. But we can \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nPSYCHOLOGY AND LITERATURE I95 \nonly understand him in his capacity of artist by lookmg at \nhis creative achievement. We should make a sad mistake tf \nwe tried to explain the mode of life of an Enghsh gentleman. \na Prussian officer, or a cardinal in terms of personal factors. \nThe gentleman, the officer and the clenc function as such in \nan impersonal Wle, and their psychic make-up is qualified \nby a pecuhar obJectivity. We must grant that the artist \ndoes not function in an official capacity-the very opposite \nis nearer the truth. He nevertheless resembles the types I \nhave named in one respect, for the specrlically arltstic chs­\nposttion mvolves an overweight of collective psycluc hfe as \nagamst the personal Art IS a kmd of innate dnve that \nseizes a human being and makes hun its instrument. The \nartist is not a person endowed with free will who seeks his \nown ends, but one who allows art to realize its purposes \nthrough him. As a human being he may have moods and \na will and personal aims, but as an artist he is \"man\" in a \nhigher sense---he is\" collective man \"-one who cames and \nshapes the unconscmus, psychic hfe of mankmd. To \nperform tlus difficult office 1t is sometimes necessary for hlm \nto sacrifice happiness and everythmg that makes life worth \nhving for the ordmary human being. \nAll this being so, it ts not strange that the arttst is an \nespecially mterestmg case for the psychologist who uses an \nanalyb.cal method. The artist's hfe cannot be otherwise \nthan full of conflicts, for two forces are at war with.J.n lum­\nen the one hand the common human longmg for happiness, \nsatisfaction and secunty m hfe, and on the other a ruthless \npassion for creation which may go so far as to override \nevery personal desire The lives of artists are as a rule so \nhighly unsatisfactory-not to say tragic-because of their \ninferiority on the human and personal side, and not because \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com"

There are hardly any exceptions \nto the rule that a person must pay dearly for the divine \ngilt of the creative fire It is as though each of us were \nendowed at birth with a certain capital of energy. The \nstrongest force in our make-up will seize and all but \nmonopolu.e this energy, leaving so little over that nothing \nof value can come of 1t. In this way the creative force can \ndrain the human impulses to such a degree that the personal \nego must develop all sorts of bad qualities----ruthlessoess, \nselfishness and vanity (so-called \" auto-erotism \")-<md eveo \nevery kind of vice, in order to maintain the spark of life and \nto keep itself from being wholly bereft The auto-erotism \nof artists resembles that of illegitimate or neglected cluldren \nwho from their tenderest years must protect themselves from \nthe destructive iniluence of people who have no love to give \nthem-who develop bad qualities for that very purpose and \nlater maintain an invincible egocentnsm by remaimng all \ntheir hves infantile and helpless or by actively offending \nagamst the moral code or the law How can we doubt that \nit is his art that explains the artist, and not the insufficiencies \nand conflicts of ms personal hie ? These are nothing hut \nthe regrettable results of the fact that he is an artist-that is \nto say, a man who from Ins very birth has been called to a \ngreater task than the ordinary mortal A spec,al ability \nmeans a heavy expenditure of energy ma particular direction, \nwith a con.sequent drain from some other side of life. \nIt makes no difference whether the poet knows that ms \nwork is begotten, grows and matures with him, or whether \nhe supposes that by taking thought he produces it out of the \nvoid His opimon of the matter does not chaoge the fact \nthat his own work outgrows him as a child its mother. The \ncreative process has feminine quality, and the creative work \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nPSYCHOLOGY AND LITERATURE I'Y/ \narises from unconscious depths-we might say, from the \nrealm of the mothers. Whenever the creative force pre­\ndommates, human hfe is ruled and moulded by the un­\nconscJ.ous as against the active will, and the conscious ego is \nswept along on a subterranean current, being nothing more \nthan a helpless observer of events. The work in process \nbecomes the poet's fate and determmes his psycluc develop­\nment. It is not Goethe who creates Faun, but Fatm wbich \ncreates Goethe And what is Faust but a symbol? By this \nI do not mean an allegory that pomts to something all too \nfamiliar, but an expression that stands for something not \nclearly known and yet profoundly ahve Here it is sometlnng \nthat hves in the soul of every German, aod that Goethe has \nhelped to bring to birth. Could we conceive of anyone but \na German wntmg Faust or Also sprach Zarathustra;, Both \nplay upon something that reverberates in the German soul \n-a \"primordial unage \", as Jacob Burckhardt once called \nit-the figure of a physician or teacher of mankind.

Being essentially the \ninstrument for his work, he is subordinate to 1t, and we have \nno reason for expecting him to interpret it for us. He has \ndone the best that m hun lies in giving it form, and he must \nleave the interpretation to others and to the future A \ngreat work of art is like a dream, for all 1ts apparent obvious­\nness it does not exp1am itself and is never unequivocal. A \ndream never says : \" You ought \", or : \" Thu is the truth \". \nIt presents an unage m much the same way as nature allows \na plant to grow, and we must draw our own conclUS1ons If \na person has a mghtmare, 1t means either that he 1S too \nmuch given to fear, or else that he is too exempt from it; \nand if he dreams of the old wise man it may mean that he is \ntoo pedagogical, as also that he stands m need of a teacher. \nIn a subtle way both meamngs come to the same tlung, as \nwe perceive when we are able to let the work of art act upon \nus as it acted upon the artist. To grasp its meaning, we must \nallow it to shape us as it once shaped bun Then we under­\nstand the nature of his expenence. We see that he has \ndrawn upon the healing and redeemmg forces of the collective \npsyche that underlies consciousness with its isolation and \nits painful errors ; that he has penetrated to that matnx \nof life in which all men are embedded, winch imparts a \ncommon rhythm to all human existence, and allows the \nindividual to commumcate his feeling and his striving to \nmankind as a whole. \nThe secret of artistic creation and of the effectiveness of \nart is to be found in a return to the state of j,4,heipatwn \nmysttq111-to that level of experience at which 1t is man who \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nPSYCHOLOGY AND LITERATURE 199 \nlives, and not the individual, and at winch the weal or woe \nof the single human bemg does not count, but only human \nexistence. This is why every great work of art 1S ob1ective \nand impersonal, but none the loss profoundly moves us each \nand all And tlus is also why the personal life of the poet \ncannot be held essential to his art-but at most a help or a \nhindrance to his crea:b.ve task, He may go the way of a \nPhilistine, a good citizen, a neurotic, a fool or a cnminal. \nHis personal career may be mevitable and interesting, but \n1t does not explam the poet. \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com"

It is \nonce more man's picture of a crea:b.ve god, stripped t1us \ntime of his anthropomorphic traits and taking the form of a \nuniversal concept whose meaning everyone presumes to \nunderstand.

If onr consciousness were not of today only, but \nhad historical continuity, we should be remmded of similar \ntransformations of the divine princ,ple in Greek philosophy, \nand this might dispose us to be more critical. of our present \nphtlosophical assumptions. We are, however, effectively \nprevented from indulging in such reflections by the spnit \nof the age. It looks upon history as a mere arsenal of \nconvenient arguments that enables us, on occasion, to say : \n\"Why, even old Anstotle knew that.\" This being the \nstate of affairs, we must ask ourselves how the spirit of the \nage attains such an uncanny power. It is without doubt a \npsychic phenomenon of the greatest importance-at all \nevents a prejudice so deeply rooted that uotil we give it \nproper consideration we cannot even approach the problem \nof the psyche. \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nPOSTULATES OF ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 205 \nAs I have said, the irresisbble tendency to account for \neverything on physical grounds corresponds to the honzontal \ndevelopment of consciousness in the last four centunes, and \nthis horizontal perspective is a reaction against the ex­\nclUS1vely vertical perspective of the Gotluc Age It is a \nmamfestation of the crowd-mind, and as such is not to be \ntreated m temis of the consciousness of mdivtduals.

Indeed, we must admit that \nas to cause, purpose and meaning, the human psyche-­\nhowever we approach it-is first and foremost a close reflec­\ntion of everything we call corporeal, empirical and mundane. \nAnd finally, in the face of all these adnusstoos, we must ask \nourselves if the psyche is not after all a secondary mamfesta­\ntion-a.n epiphenomenon-and completely dependent upon \nthe body. In the light of reason and of our comnutments as \npractical men to an actual world, we say yes It is only our \ndoubts as to the omnipotence of matter which could lead us \nto examine in a critical way tins verdict of science upon the \nhuman psyche. \nThe obJection has already been raised that thts approach \nreduces psycbic happenings to a kmd of activity of the \nglands; thoughts are regarded. a,; secretions of the brain, \nand so we ac1ueve a psychology without the psyche. From \nthis standpoint, it must be confessed, the psyche does not \nexist m its own right , 1t is nothing m itself, but is the mere \nexpression of physical processes. That these processes bave \nthe qualities of consciousness is Just an irreducible fact­\nwere 1t otherwise, so the argument runs, we could not speak \nof the psyche at all ; there would be no consciousness, aod \nso we should have nothing to say about anything. Conscious­\nness, therefore, is taken as the s1,u qua non of psycluc hfe \n-that is to say, as the psyche itself. And so it comes about \nthat all modern \" psychologies without the psyche \" are \nstudies of consciousness which ignore the existence of \nnnconscious psychic life. \nYet there is not °\"\" modern psychology-there are several. \nThis is curious enough when we remember that there is only \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nPOSTULATES OF ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 207 \none science of mathematics, of geology, zoology, botany and \nso forth. But there are so many psychologies that an \nAmerican Uruversity was able to publish a tluck volume \nunder the title : Psychologus of 1930 I beheve there are \nas many psychologtes as philosoplues, for there is also no \none Slllgle plulosophy, but many. I m.entwn tins for the \nreason that philosophy and psychology are hnked by in­\ndissoluble bonds wluch are kept 111 bemg by the mter-relation \nof their subJect-matters. Psychology takes the psyche for \nits subject-matter, and philosophy-to put it bnefly-takes \nthe world. Until recently psychology was a special branch \nof philosophy, but now we are commg to something which \nNietzsche foresaw-the ascendance of psychology 1n its own \nright It is even threatening to swallow philosophy. The \ninner resemblance of the two discJ.phnes consists m tlus, \nthat both are systems of opmion about subject-matter which \ncannot be fully experienced and therefore cannot be compre­\nhended by a purely empincal approach. Both fields of study \nthus encourage speculation, with the result that opinions are \nformed in such variety and profusion that heavy volumes \nare needed to contain them all, whether they belong to the \none field or to the other. Neither disc1plme can do without \nthe other, and the one always furrushes the implicit-and \nfrequently even unconscious-primary assumptions of the \nother. \nThe modern preference for physical grounds of explanation \nleads, as already remarked, to a \" psychology without the \npsyche \"-I mean, to the view that the psyche is nothing \nbut a product of biochenucal processes As for a modern, \nscientifi:c psychology wlnch starts from the mind as such, \nthere simply is none. No one today would venture to \nfound a scientific psychology upon the poatulate of an \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\n208 POSTULATES OF ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY \nindependent psyche that is not determined by the body. \nToe idea of spirit m and for itself, of a self-contained world.­\nsystem of the spirit that is the only adequate postulate for \nthe belief in autonomous, individual souls, is extremely \nunpopular with us, to say the least. But I must remark that, \nin 1914, I attended at Bedford College, London, a joint \nsession of the Aristotelian Society, the Mind AssOCJabon \nand the British Psychological Society, at which a symposium \nwas held on the question : Are individual nnnds contained \nin God or are they not -;, Should anyone in England dispute \nthe scientific standing of these SOC1eties, he would not receive \na very conha1 hearing, for their memberslnp mcludes the \noutstandmg mmds of the country. And perhaps I was the \nonly person in the audience who listened with surprise to \narguments that had the nng of the thirteenth century Tlus \ninstance may serve to show that the idea of an autonomous \nspmt whose exIStence is taken for granted has not died \nout everywhere m Europe or become a mere fossil left over \nfrom the Middle Ages \nIf we keep this in mind, we can perhaps summon up the \ncourage to col1Slder the possibility of a \" psychology with \nthe psyche \"-that is, of a field of study based on the assump­\ntion of an autonomous psyche. We need not be alarmed at \nthe unpopulanty of such an undertaking, for to postulate \nmind is no more fantastic than to postulate matter Smee \nwe have literally no idea of the way in which what is psycluc \ncan anse from physical elemeots, and yet cannot deny the \nreality of psychic events, we are free to frame our uswnpbons \nthe other way about for once. and to hold that the psyche \narises from a spiritual pnnciple which is as ma.eeesstble to \nour wuierstandmg as matter. To be sure, t1us will not be a \nnwdem psychology, for to be modern is to deny such a. \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nPOSTULATES OF ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 209 \npossibility. For better or worse, therefore. we must turn \nback to the teachings of our forefathers, for they it was who \nmade such assumptiOIIS. The ancient view held that spirit \nwas essentially the life of the body, the hie-breath, or a \nkind of life-force which assumed spatial and corporeal form \nat birth or after conception, and left the dyiDg body again \nafter the final breath. The spirit in itself was considered as \na being without extension, and because it existed before \ntalang corporeal form and afterwards as well, 1t was con­\nsidered as tuneless and hence unm.ortal. From the stand­\npoint of modem, scientific psychology, this conception 1S of \ncourse pure illusion. But as it is not our intention to mdulge \nin \"metaphysics\", even of a modem vanety, we will \ne:xamme tins time-honoured notion for once m an un­\npre1udiced way and test its empmca.l Justification \nThe names people give to their expenences are often \nqwte enhghterung What is the origin of the word Seels ? \nLike the English word soul, it comes from the Gothic sa,rffla \nand the Old German sa,wal8, and these can be connected with \nthe Greek awlos, mobile, coloured, iridescent The Greek \nword psyche also means butterfly. Sas'IIHlltJ is related on the \nother side to the old Slavomc word slla, meaning strength \nFrom these connections hght 15 thrown on the origmal \nmearu.ng of the word Sule . 1t lS moving force, that IS, \nlife-force. \nThe Lahn words a,mnus, spirit, and ansma, soul, are the \nsame as the Greek 11nemos, wind. The other Greek word for \nwind, pneumr,, means also spirit. In Gothic we find the \nsame word m us--a,um, to breathe out, and in Latin ••lulare, \nto pant. In Old High German, sf>•nlus - was rendered \nby atun, breath. In Arabic, wind is Jih, and riih is soul, \nspirit. There is a quite similar connection with the Greek \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\n2m POSTULATES OF ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY \npsyche, which is related to psycho, to breathe, psychos, cool, \npsychros, cold, and phusa, bellows. These affinities show \nclearly how in Latin, Greek and Arabic the names given to \nthe soul are related to the notion of moving air, the \"cold \nbreath of the spirit \". And this also is why the primitive \npoint of view endows the soul with an invisible breath-body \nIt is quite evident that, since breath is the sign of hfe, \nbreath is taken for life, as are also movement and moving \nforce. According to another prirmtive view the soul is \nregarded as fire or flame, because warmth also is a sign of \nlife. A very cunous, but by no means rare, primitive con­\nception identifies the soul with the name. The name of an \nindividual is his soul, and hence anses the custom of usmg \nthe ancestor's name to reincarnate the ancestral soul in the \nnew-born child We can infer from this that the ego­\nconsc1ousness was recogruzed as an expresston of the soul. \nNot infrequently the soul is identified with the shadow, for \nwluch reason it is a deadly insult to tread upon a person's \nshadow. For the same reason, noon-day, the ghost-hour of \nsouthern latitudes, ts collSldered threaterung; the shadow \nthen grows small, and this means that life is endangered. \nThis conception of the shadow contains an idea which was \nindicated by the Greeks m the word synopados, \"he who \nfollows behind \". They expressed in this way the feeling \nof an intangible, living presence-the same feeling winch \nled to the behef that the souls of the departed were shadows. \nThese indications may serve to show how primitive man \nexpenenced the psyche. To him the psyche appears as the \nsource of hfe, the pnme mover, a ghost-like presence which \nhas objective reality. Therefore the primitive knows how \nto converse with his soul ; 1t becomes vocal within him \nbecause it is not he himself and his consciousness. To \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nPOSTULATES OF ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 2n \nprimitive man the psyche is not, as it is to us, the epitome \nof all that is subjective and subject to the will ; on the \ncontrary, it is something objecbve, contained in itself, and \nliving its own life. \nThis way of looking at the matter is empirically justified, \nfor not only on the prumtive level, but WJ.th civilized man \nas well, psychic happenings have an objective side. In large \nmeasure they are withdrawn from our conscious control. We \nare unable, for example, to suppress many of our emotions ; \nwe cannot change a bad mood into a good one, and we cannot \ncommand our dreams to come or go The most intelligent \nman may at tunes be obsessed with thoughts whtch he \ncannot drive away with the greatest effort of wtll The \nmad tncks that memory plays sometimes leave us m helpless \namazement, and at any time unexpected fantBS1es may ran \nthrough our minds We only beheve that we are masters in \nour own house because we hke to flatter ourselves. Actually, \nhowever, we are dependent to a startling degree upon the \nproper funchontng of the unconscious psyche, and must \ntrust that it does not fail us. If we study the psychic \nprocesses of neurotic persons, it seems perfectly ludicrous \nthat any psychologist could take the psyche as the eqmvalent \nof consc1oumess. And it is well known that the psychic \nprocesses of neurotics differ hardly at all from those of so­\ncalled normal persons-for what man today is qmte sure \nthat he is not neurone ' \nThis being so, we shall do well to admit that there is \njustification for the old view of the soul as a.n objective \nreahty-as something independent, and therefore capricious \nand dangerous The further assumption that tins being, so \nmysterious and terrifying, is at the same time the source \nof life, is also understandable in the light of psychology. \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\n212 POSTULATES OF ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY \nExperience shows us that the sense of the \"I \"-the ego­\nconsciousness-g out of unconscious hfe.

After all, the soul is something out of the common \nWhtle everythmg else that exists takes up a certam amount \nof room, the soul cannot be located in space. We suppose, \nof course, that our thoughts are in our heads, but when 1t \ncomes to our feelings we begin to be uncertain , they appear \nto dwell 1n the region of the heart.

And so we canool dismiss the \ncollective unconscious as illusion, or refuse to recognize and \nstudy it as a valuable source of knowledge. \nLooked at from without, the psyche appears to us to be \nessentially a reflection of external happenings-to be not \nonly occasioned by them, but to have its origin m tbem. \nAnd 1t also seems to us that the unconscious can be under­\nstood only from without and from the side of conscrousness. \nIt ,s well known that Freod has attempted an explanation \nfrom this side-an undertaking which could only socceed \nif the unconscious were actually something which came into \nbeing with the existence and COOSCIDUSOeSS of the mdividual. \nBut the truth is that the unconscious is always there before­\nhand as a potential system of psychic functioning handed \ndown by generations of man.

We are m all truth so enclosed by psychic \nimages that we cannot penetrate to the essence of things \nexternal to ourselves. All our knowledge is conditioned \nby the psyche which, because it alone is immedlate, is \nsuperlatively real. Here there is a reality to which the \npsychologist can appeal-namely, psychic reality. \nIf we go more deeply into the meaning of this concept, it \nseems to us that certain psycluc contents or images are \nderived from a material environment to which our bodies \nalso belong, whJle others, which are m no way less real, \nseem to come from a mental source which appears to be very \ndifferent from the physical enVU'Onment Whether I picture \nto myself the car I WWl to buy, or try to imagme the state \nin wluch the soul of my dead father now is-whether 1t is an \nexternal fact or a thought that occupies me-both happen­\nings are psycluc reahty. The only drl'ference is that one \npsychic happening refers to the physical world, and the \nother to the mental world. If I change my concept of \nreality in such a way as to admit that all psychu: happenings \nare real-and no other use of the concept is vahd-tlus puts \nan end to the conflict of matter and mind as contradictory \nexplanatory principles.

If a fire burns me I do not \nquestioo the reality of the fire, whereas if I am beset by the \nfear that a ghost will appear, I take refuge behind the \nthought that it is only an illusion. But just as the fire is the \npsyclnc image of a physical process whose nature is unknown \nso my fear of the gh01t is a psychic image from a mental \nsource ; it is just as real as the fire, for my fear is as real as \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nPOSTULATES OF ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 22z \nthe pain caused by the fire As for the mental process that \n:6nally underlies my fear of the ghost-it IS as unknown to \nme as the nltimate nature of matter. And just as 1t never \noccurs to me to account for the nature of :fire except by the \nconcepts of chennstry and physu:s, so I would never think \nof trying to explain my fear of ghosts except in terms of \nmental processes. \nThe fact that all immediate experience is psychic and that \nimmediate reality can only be psychic, explains why 1t IS \nthat primitive man puts the appearance of ghosts and the \neffects of magic on a plane with physical events.

We must adrmt \nthe fact, however difficult it is for us to understand that \nsomething which previous ages have discarded should \nsuddenly command our attention. That there 1S a general \ninterest in these matters is a troth which cannot be dented, \ntheir offence to good taste notwithstanding. I am not \nthinking merely of the interest taken in psychology as a \nscience, or of the still narrower mterest in the psychoanalysis \nof Freud, but of the widespread interest mall sorts of psychic \nphenomena as marufested m the growth of spintualism, \nastrology, theosophy, and so forth. The world has seen \nnothtng hke it smce the end of the seventeenth century. \nWe can compare it only to the flowering of Gnostic thought \nin the first and second centunes after Christ. The spintual \ncurrents of the present have, m fact, a deep affinity with \nGnosticism. There is even a Gnostic church in France \ntoday, and I know of two schools in Germ.any wluch openly \ndeclare themselves Gnostic. The modern movement which \nis numerically most impressive 1s undoubtedly Theosophy, \ntogether with its continental sister, Anthroposophy; these \nare pure Gnosticism in a Hindu dress. Compared with these \nmovements the interest in scientific psychology is negligible. \nWhat is striking about Gnostic systems is that they are \nbased exclusively upon the manifestations of the unconscious, \nand that their moral teachings do not baulk at the shadow­\nside of life. Even in the fonn of its European reVIval, the \nHindu Kundalusi-Yoga shows this clearly. And as every \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nTHE SPIRITUAL PROBLEM OF MODERN MAN 239 \nperson informed on the subject of occultism will testify, the \nstatement holds true in this field as well. \nThe pass10nate mterest in these movements arises un­\ndoubtedly from psychic energy which can no longer be \ninvested in obsolete forms of religion. For tins reason such \nmovements have a truly rehglous character, even when they \npretend to be scienWic It changes nothing when Rudolf \nSteiner calls his Anthroposophy \"spintual SCleD.ce '', or \nMrs. Eddy discovers a ..

These attempts \nat concealment merely show that rehgion has grown suspect \n-almost as suspect as politics and world-reform. \nI do not believe that I am gOlllg too far when I say that \nmodern man, in contrast to lus nineteenth-century brother, \nturns his attention to the psyche with very great expecta­\ntions ; and that he does so without reference to any tradi­\ntional creed, but rather in the Gnostic sense of rehgious \nexpenence We should be wrong m seeing mere caricature \nor masquerade when the movements already mentioned try \nto give themselves scientrlic 8J.I'S , their domg so lS rather an \nmdication that they are actually pursuing \" science \" or \nknowledge instead of the /•uh wluch 1S the essence of Western \nrehgiuns.

Our age is \napparently bent on discovering what eX1Sts m the psyche \noutside of consciousness. The questwn asked in every \nspintualistic circle is : What happens when the medium \nhas lost oomciousness ? Every Theosophist asks : What \nshall I experience at higher levels of consciouaness ? The \nquestion which every astrologer puts is this : What are the \neffective forces and determinants of my fate beyond the \nreach of my CODSClOUS intenbon ? And every psychoanalyst \nwants to know : What are the unconscJ.Ous dnves behind \nthe neuI'OSlS ;, \nOur age wishes to have actual expenences m psyclnc hfe. \nIt wants to expenence for itself, and not to make assumptions \nbased on the experience of other ages. Yet tlus does not \npreclude its trying anything m a hypothetical way-for \ninstance, the recogmzed rehgions and the genuine SC1ences. \nThe European of yesterdaywill leel a slight shudder run down \nhis spme when he gazes at all deeply mto these delvmgs \nNot only does he consider the subJect of this research all too \nobscure and uncanny, but even the methods employed seem \nto hlln a shocking misuse of man's finest mtell.ectual attain­\nments.

If we are pessunists, we shall call it a sign of \ndecadence ; if we are optinustically mchned. we shall see \nin it the promise of a far-reaching spmtual change in the \nWestern world. At all events, it is a stgnifi.cant mamfesta­\ntion. It is the more noteworthy because it shows itself in \nbroad sections of every people ; and 1t is the more important \nbecause it is a matter of those unponderable psycluc forces \nwhich transform human hfe m ways that are unforeseen and \n-as history shows----unforeseeable These are the forces, \nstill mVISible to many persons today, which are at the bottom \nof the present \" psychological \" mterest. When the attrac­\ntive power of psychic We 1S so strong that man is neither \nrepelled nor dismayed by what he is sure to find, then it has \nnothing of sicldmess or pervemon about it. \nAlong the great lughroads of the world everything seems \ndesolate and outworn Instmctlvely the modem man leaves \nthe trodden ways to explore the by-paths and lanes, Just as \nthe man of the Gneco-Roman world cast off his defunct \nOlymp,an gods and turned to the mystery-cults of Asia. \nThe force w1thm us that unpels us to the search, turning \noutward, annexes Eastern Theosophy and magic ; but it \nalso turns inward and leads us to give our thoughtful atten­\ntion to the unconscious psyche. It inspires in us the self­\nsame scepticism and relentlessness with which a Buddha \nswept aside !us two oulhon gods that he might come to the \npristine experience which alone is convincing. \nAnd now we must ask a final question. Is what I have said \nof the modem man really true, or is it perhaps the result of \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\n252 THE SPIRITUAL PROBLEM OF MODERN MAN \nan optical illusion ? There can be no doubt whatever that \nthe facts I have cited are wholly urelevant contingencies m \nthe eyes of many mllhons of Westerners, and seem only \nregrettable errors to a large number of educated persons. \nBut I may ask . What dul a cultivated Roman thlnk of \nChristianity when he saw it spreading among the people of \nthe lowest classes ? The biblical God is still a hvmg person \nin the Western world-as hvmg as Allah beyond the \nMediterranean. One kind of behever holds the other an \nignoble heretic, to be pitied and tolerated if he cannot be \nchanged What is more, a clever European is convinced \nthat rebgion and such tlungs are good enough for the masses \nand for women, but are of httle weight compared to \necononnc and pohtical affairs \nSo I am refuted all along the hne, hke a man who predicts \na thunderstorm. when there is not a cloud 1n the sky Perhaps \n1t IS a storm beneath the horizon that he senses-and 1t may \nnever reach us But what is sigm.ficant in psychic bfe 1s \nalways below the horizon of consciousness, and when we \nspeak of the spintual problem of modem man we are dealing \nwith t1ungs that are barely visible-with the most mtunate \nand fragile thinp---with flowers that open only in the night \nJn daylight everytlung is clear and tangible ; but the night \nlasts as long as the day, and we live m the mght-time also. \nThere are persons who have bad dreams wluch even spoil \ntheir days for them. And the day's life is for many people \nsuch a bad dream that they long for the night when the \nspirit awakes. I even believe that there are nowadays a \ngreat many such people, and this is why I maintain that the \nspiritual problem of modern man is much as I have presented \nit.

It was solely !us hatred of \nthe Chnstiaas that set him upon the road to Damascus, \nand to that decisive experience whicll was to decide the \nwhole COUI>e of his hie. He was brought to this experience \nby following with conviction the course in wluch he was \nmoot completely mistaken. This opens up for us an \napproach to the problems of life which we can hardly take \ntoo eeriously. And it confronts the psychotherapist with \na question whicll brings 1nm shoulder to shoulder with the \ncle,gyman : the question of good and evil \nIt is in reahty the priest or the clergyman, rather than the \ndoctor, who should be most concerned with the problem of \nspiritual suffering. But in most cases the sufferer consults \nthe doctor in the first place, because he supposes lumself \nto be physically ill, and because certain neurouc symptoms \ncan be at least alleviated by drugs. But 11, on the other hand, \nthe clergyman is consulted, he cannot persuade the sick man \nthat the trouble is psycluc As a rule be lacks the special \nknowledge which would enable him to cbscem the psycluc \nfactors of the disease, and his Judgement is without the \nweight of authonty. \nThere are, however, persons who, while well aware of the \npsychic nature of their complaint, nevertheless refuse to \nturn to the clergyman They do not believe that he can \nreally help them Such persons distrust the doctor for the \nsame reason, and they are J-fied by the fact that both \ndoctor and clergyman stand before them with empty hands, \nd not-what is even ~with empty words We can \nhardly expect the doctor to have anythmg to say about the \nu!tunate questions of the soul. It is from the clergyman, \nnot from the doctor, that the sufferer should expect such \nhelp. But the Protestant clergyman often finds himself \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nPSYCHOTHERAPISTS OR THE CLERGY z63 \nface to face with an almost impossible task, for he has to \ncope with practu:al duliculties that the Cathohc priest is \nspared Above all, the priest has the authority of his \nChurch behmd bun, and his econOJWc position is secure and \nindependent This is far less true of the Protestant clergy­\nman who may be manied and burdened with the respon­\nsibility of a family, and cannot expect, if all else fails, to be \nsupported by lus commwuty or taken mto a monastery. \nBut the pnest, rl he 1s also a Jesuit, even has at his chsposal \nthe psychological teaching of the preseot day. I know, for \ninstance, that my own writmgs were senously studied m \nRome long before any Protestant pastor thought them \nworthy of a glance \nWe have come to a serious pass. The exodus from the \nGennao Protestant Chorch JS only one of many symptoms \nwlu.ch should make it plam to the clergy that mere admoni­\ntions to beheve, or to perfonn acts of charity, do not give \nmodem man what he IS lookmg for. The fact that many \nclergymeo seek support or practical help from Freud's \ntheory of sexuahty or Adler's theory of power is astonishing, \ninasmuch as both these theones are hosttle to spiritual \nvalues, being, as I have said, psychology without the psyche. \nThey are rational methods of treatmeot which actually \nhioder the reahzauon of meanmgful expenence. By far the \nlarger number of psychotherapists are chsctples of Freud or \nof Adler This means that the great ma1onty of patients \nare necessanly alienated from a spmtual standpomt-a fact \nwhich cannot be a matter of mdifference to one who has the \nreahzation of spiritual values much at heart. The wave of \ninterest in psychology which at present is sweeping over \nthe Protestant countries of Europe 1S far from receding. It \nis cnincident with the general exodus from the Chorch. \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\n26.j PSYCHOTHERAPISTS OR THE CLERGY \nQuoting a Protestant minister, I may say : \" Nowadays \npeople go to the psychotheraplSt rather than to the \nclergyman.\" \nI am convinced that this statement is true only of relatively \neducated persons, not of mankind in the mass. However, \nwe must not forget that it will be some twenty years before \nthe ordinary run of people begin to think the thoughts of \nthe educated person of today. For instance, Bilchner's \nwork, Fo,ce and Mdn, became one of the most widely \nread bocks in German public libraries about twenty years \nafter educated persons had begun to forget about it. I am \npersuaded that what is today a vital interest in psychology \namong educated persons will tomormw be shared by \neveryone. \nI should hl<e to call attention to the following facts. \nDuring the past thirty years, people from all the avilized \ncountnes of the earth have consulted me I have treated \nmany hundreds of patients, the huger number being \nProtestants, a smaller number Jews, and not more than five \nor six beheving Cathohcs. Among all my patients in the \nsecond half of lif&-that is to say, over thirty-five-there \nhas not been one whose problem in the last resort was not \nthat of finchng a rehgious outlook on life. It is safe to say \nthat every one of them fell ill because he had lost that winch \nthe living religions of every age have given to their followers, \nand none of them has been really healed who did not \nregain his rehgious outlook This of course has nothing \nwhatever to do with a particular creed or membership of a \nchurch. \nHere, then, the clergyman stands before a vast horizon. \nBut it would seem as if no one had noticed it. It also looks \nas though the Protestant clergyman of today was in-\nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nPSYCHOTHERAPISTS OR THE CLERGY 265 \nsufficiently equipped to cope with the urgent psychic needs \nof our age It is indeed high tune for the clergyman and \nthe psychotherapist to jom forces to meet this great spiritual \ntask. \nHere is a concrete example which goes to show how \nclosely this problem touches us all Somewhat more than \ntwo years ago the leaders of the Christian Students' \nConference at Aarau (Switzerland) laid before me the question \nwhether people jn spmtual distress prefer nowadays to \nconsult the doctor rather than the clergyman, and what are \nthe causes of their choke. This was a very direct and \nconcrete question. At that time I knew nothmg more \nthan the fact that my own pahents obviously had con­\nsulted the doctor rather than the clergyman. It seemed \nto me to be open to doubt whether this was generally the \ncase or not. At any rate, I was unable to give a definite \nreply. I therefore set on foot ao enqwry, through acquain­\ntances of mine, among people whom I dul not know , I \nsent out a questionnaire which was answered by Swiss~ \nGerman, and French Protestants, as well as by a few \nCatholics. The results are very interesting, as the following \ngeneral summary shows. Those who decided for the doctor \nrepresented 57 per cent. of the Protestants and only 25 per \ncent of the Cathohcs, while those who decided for the \ndivine formed 8 per cent of the Protestants and 58 per cent. \nof the Catholics. These were the unequivocal decisions. \nThere were some 35 per cent. of the Protestants who could \nnot make up their mmds, while only 17 per cent of the \nCatholics were undecided. \nThe reason given for not consulting the minister of the \nchurch was generally his lack of psychological knowledge \nand insight, and this covered 52 per cent. of the aoswers. \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\n266 PSYCHOTHERAPISTS OR THE CLERGY \nSome 28 per cent. were to the effect that he was prejudiced \nin his views and showed a dogma.UC and traditional bias. \nCuriously enough, there was even one clergyman who \ndeClded for the doctor, while another made the irritated \nretort : \" Theology has nothing to do with the treatment of \nhuman beings \". All the relatives of clergymen who \nanswered my questionnaire pronounced themselves against \nthe clergy. \nIn so far as tlus enquiry was restricted to educated persons. \nit IS only a straw in the wind I am convinced that the \nuneducated classes would have reacted differently But I am \ninclined to accept the results as a more or less valid indication \nof the views of educated people, the more so as it is a well­\nknown fact that their indifference in matters of the Church \nand religion is stea.dtly growmg. And we must not forget \nthat truth of soc,al psychology to whiclt I have already \nreferred : that it takes about twenty years for a general \noutlook upon We to percolate down from the educated class \nto the uneducated masses. Who, for mstance, would have \ndared to prophesy twenty years ago, or even ten, that Spain, \nthe most Catholic of European countries, would undergo the \nunexampled spui.tual transformation we are witnessing \ntoday ' And yet 1t has broken out with the violence of a \ncataclysm \nIt seems to me, that, side by side with the decline of \nreligious life, the neuroses grow noticeably more frequent. \nThere are as yet no statistics which enable us to prove t1us \nincrease in actual numbers. But of one thing I am sure, \nthat everywhere the mental state of European man shows \nan alarming lack of balance. We are living undeniably in \na period of the greatest restlessness, nervous tension, \nconfusion and disorientation of outlook. Amm:ig my patients \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nPSYCHOTIIERAP!STS OR TIIE CLERGY 267 \nfrom many countries, all of them educated persons, there \nlS a COllSlderable number who came to see me, not because \nthey were suffenng from a neurosis, but because they could \nfind no meamng 1Il hfe or were tortunng themselves with \nquestions wluch neither present-day phtlosophy nor religion \ncould answer. Some of them perhaps thought that I knew \nof a magic formula, but I was soon forced to tell them that \nI, too, had no answer to give. And tlns bnngs us to practical \nconsiderations \nLet us take for example that most ordmary and frequent \nof questions What is the meaning of my We, or of hfe in \ngeneral ;, Men to-day beheve that they know only too well \nwhat the clergyman will say----or, rather, must say-to this. \nThey smtle at the very thought of the philosopher's answer, \nand in general do not expect much of the physician But \nfrom the psychotherapist who analyses the unconscious­\nfrom him one might doubtless learn somethmg He has \nperhaps dug up from the depths of hts mind, among other \nthmgs, a meanmg for hfe wluch could be bought for a fee I \nIt must be a rehef to every serious-minded person to hear \nthat the psychotherapist also does not know what to say. \nSuch a confession is often the beginning of the patient's \nconfidence m him \nI have found that modern man has an ineradicable avemon \nfor traditional opimons and mhented truths. He is a \nBolshevist for whom all the spintual standards and forms \nof the past have lost their validity, and who therefore wants \nto expenment in the world of the spint as the Bolshevist \nexpenments with econODllCS When confronted with this \nmodern attitude, every ecclesiastical system 1S in a parlous \nstate, be it Catholic, Protestant, Buddlust or Confucian. \nAmong these modems there are of course certain of those \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\n268 PSYCHOTHERAPISTS OR THE CLERGY \ndenigrahng, destructive and pervene natures-unbalanced \neccentrics-who are never satisfied anywhere, and who \ntherefore flock to every new banner, much to the hurt of \nthese movements and undertakings, in the hope of finding \nsomething /or o,sce which will atone at a low cost for their \nown insufficiency. It goes without saying that, in my \nprofessional work, I have come to know a great many \nmodem men and women, and such pathological pseudo­\nmodems among them. But I prefer to leave these asule. \nThose of whom I am thinking are by no means s,cldy \neccentrics, but are most often exceptionally able, courageous \nand upnght persons who have repudiated our trad1twnal \ntruths for honest and decent reasons, and not from wicked­\nness of heart. Every one of them has the feehng that our \nrehglous truths have somehow or other grown empty. \nEither they cannot reconcile the scienh.fic and the rehgious \noutlooks, or Cbrisban tenets have lost the1r authority and \ntheir psychological justuicallon People no longer feel \nthemselves to have been redeemed by the death of Christ , \nthey canoot behev&-they cannot compel themselves to \nbelieve, however happy they may deem the man who has a \nbelief.

After all, \nwhy should not Buddha be in the right, also ' \nThere JS no one who is not familiar with these questions \nand doubts. Yet Freudian analysis would brush all these \nmatters aside as u:relevant. It holds the position that the \nbasic problem is that of repressed sexuality, and that philo­\nsophical or religious doubts only mask the true state of \naffairs. If we closely examine the individual case, we do \nactually discover peculiar disturbances in the sexual sphere \nas well as in the sphere of the unconscious impulses in general \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nPSYCHOTHERAPISTS OR THE CLERGY 269 \nIt is Freud's way to see in these disturbances an explanation \nof the psychic disturbance as a whole ; be is interested only \nin the causal interpretation of the sexual symptoms. He \ncompletely overlooks the fact that, m certain cases, the \nsupposed causes of the neurOSIS were al.ways present, but \nhad no pathological effect untsl a disturbance of the conscious \nattitude set m and led to a neurotic upset.

The causes of \na neurosis lie m the present as well as in the past ; and only \na still existmg ea.use can keep a neurosis acb.ve. A man IS \nnot tubercular because he was infected twenty years ago \nwith ba.ctlh, but because foci of mfection are still active tcxlay. \nThe questwns when and how the infectwn took place are even \nquite irrelevant to his present condition. Even the most \naccurate knowledge of the previous history of the case cannot \ncure tuberculOSlS. And the same holds true of the neuroses. \nThis JS why I regard the rebgious problems wluch the \npatient brings before me as relevant to the neurosis and as \npossible causes of ,t. But 1! I take them seriously, I must \nadmit to the patient that his feelmgs are justified \" Yes, \nI agree, Buddha may be right as well as Jesus.

He asks himseli. \"What would the pastor \nsay if I began to tell him of the pamful details of my sexual \ndisturbances ? \" He rightly suspects that the pastor's \nmoral preJudice is even stronger than Ins dogmatic bias. \nIn tins connect10n there JS a good story about the Amencan \npresident, \" silent Cal \" Coolidge When he returned after \nan absence one Sunday morning his wife asked him where \nhe had been. \"To church\", he replied \"What did the \nIDllllSter say 1\" \"He talked about sin.\" \"And what chd \nhe say about sm ? \" \" He was against 1t \" \nIt might be supposed that 1t 1S easy for the doctor to show \nunderstamhng m tlns respect. But people forget that even \ndoctors have moral scruples, and that certain patients' \nconfessions are hard even for a doctor to swallow. Yet the \npatient does not feel hllllself accepted unless the very worst \nin him 1s accepted too No one can bring this about by mere \nwords , it comes only through the doctor's smcerity and \nthrough h1S attitude towards lumself and his own evtl side \nIf the doctor wants to offer gwdance to another, or even to \naccompany hun a step of the way, he must be in touch with \nthis other person's psycluc hfe He is never in touch when he \npasses Judgement. Whether he puts lus Judgements mto \nwords, or keeps them to lumseU, makes not the shghtest \ndifference. To take the opposite position, a.nd to agree with \nthe patient offhand, is also of no use, but estranges him as \nmuch as condemnation. We can get m touch with another \nperson only hy an attitude of unprejudleed obJeetivity. This \nmay&OUDd like a scientific precept, and may be confused with \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nPSYCHOTHERAPISTS OR THE CLERGY z7I \na purely intellectual and detached attitude of mind. But \nwhat I mean to convey IS something qmte drllerent.

I do \nnot m the least mean to say that we must never pass Judge­\nment m the cases of persons whom we desire to help and \nimprove. But if the doctor wishes to help a human being \nhe must be able to accept bun as he is.

But it is the same with every smgle human being \nand lus reasonably ordered world. His reason has doue \nviolence to natural forces winch seek their revenge and only \nawait the moment when the partition falls to overwhelm \nthe conscious life with destruction. Man has been aware \nof tlus danger since the earliest times, even in the most \nprimitive stages of culture. It was to arm himself against \nthis threat and to heal the damage dooe, that he developed \nreligious and magical practices. This ,. why the \nmedicine-man IS also the priest ; he is the saviour of the \nbody as well as of the soul, and rehgums are systems of \nheahng for psychic illness. This is espeaa.lly true of the \ntwo greatest religious of man, Chnstiamty and Buddhism \nMan is uever helped m his suffering by whst he thmks for \nhimself, but only by revelatious of a WlSdom greater than his \nown. It is this which lifts him out of Ins distress. \nToday thlS eruptioo of destructive forces hss already \ntakeo place, and man suffers from 1t 111 spirit. Thst is why \npa:bents force the psychothempist mto the rBle of a pnest, \nand expect and demand of hun that he shall free them from \ntheir distress. Thst is why we psychothera(llSts must \noccupy ourselves with problems winch, strictly speakmg, \nbelong to the theologian. But we cannot leave these ques­\ntious for theology to answer ; the urgent, psychic needs of \nsullermg people confront us with them day after day. Since, \nas a rule, every coucept and viewpoint hsuded down from \nthe past fails us, we must first tread with the patient the \npath of his illness-the path of lus llUStake that sharpens \nhis conflicts and iJlcreases his loucliness till 1t grows Ull• \nbearable-hoping that from the psychic depths which cast up \nthe powers of destructioo the rescuing f0:t<es will come also. \nWhen fint I took tlus direction I did not know where 1t \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nPSYCHOTHERAPISTS OR THE CLERGY z79 \nwould lead. I did not know what lay hid in the depths of \nthe psyclie-thzt region which I have since called the \n\" collective unconscious \". and whose contents I designate \nas \" archetypes \". Since tune unmemorial, eruptions of the \nunconscious have taken place, and ever and again they have \nrepeated themselves. Consciousness did not exist from the \nbeginning, and in every child 1t has to be built up anew in \nthe fimt years of hie. Consciousness is very weak in this \nformative period, and history shows us that the same is \ntrue of mankmd-the unconscious easily seizes power. \nThese struggles have left their marks To put it in scientific \nterms : instinctive defence-mechanisms have been developed \nwluch automatically intervene when the danger 18 greatest, \nand their commg into action JS represented in fantasy by \nhelpful images wluch are meradicably fured in the hunian \npsyche. These mechanisms come into play whenever the \nneed is great. Science can only establish the existence of \nthese psychic la.cto,s and attempt a rational explanation by \noffermg an hypothesis as to their sources. Tlus, however, \nonly thrusts the problem a stage back and in no way answers \nthe nddle. We thus come to those ultimate queshons: \nWhence does oonsciousness come 1 What is the psyche 1 \nAnd at this point all saence ends \nIt is as though, at the culmination of the illness, the \ndestructive powers were converted into heabng forces. This \nis brought about by the fa.et that the arehetypes come to \nindependent hie and serve as spiritual guides for the \npersonality, thus supplantmg the inadequate ego with its \nfutile willmg and stnw,g. As the religious-minded person \nwould say . guidance has come from God. With most of \nmy patients I have to avoid this formulabon, for it reminds \nthem too much of what they have to reiect I must express \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\n:z8o PSYCHOTHERAPISTS OR IBE CLERGY \nmyseH in more modest terms, and say that the psyche has \nawakened to spontaneous life And indeed this formula \nmore closely fits the observable facts. The transformation \ntakes place at that moment when in dreams or fantasies \nthemes appear whose source in cOilSClOUSDess cannot be \nshown. To the patient ,t is nothing less than a revelation \nwhen, from the hidden depths of the psyche, something \narises to confront him-thmg strange that is not the \n\" I \" and is therefore beyond the reach of personal caprice \nHe has gained access to the sources of psyclnc life, and this \nmarks the begmning of the cure. \nThis process. if it is to be made clear. should undoubtedly \nbe discwsed with the help of suitable examples But it IS \nalmost imposs1ble to find one or more convincing illustrations, \nfor it is usually a most subtle and complicated matter. That \nwhich is so effective is often simply the deep impression \nmade on the patient by the indePendent way m wluch his \ndreams treat of his ddliculties Or it may be that his fantasy \npoints to something for whicll his cooscious mind was qurte \nunprepared. Most often ,t is contents of an archetypal \nnature, connected in a certain way, that exert a strong \ninfluence of their own whether or not they are understood \nby the conscious mind. This spontaoeous activity of the \npsyche often becomes so intense that visionary pictures are \nseen or inner voices heard. These are manifestations of the \nspirit directly experienced today as they have been from \ntune immemorial. \nSuch expenences reward the sufferer for the pains of the \nlabyrinthme way. From this point forward a hght shines \nthrough his confusion ; he can reconcile himself with the \nwarfare within and so come to bridge the morbid split in his \nnature upon a higher level. \nDownloaded from https://www.holybooks.com\n\f\nPSYCHOTHERAPISTS OR THE CLERGY 28r \nThe fundamental problems of modem psychotherapy are \nso important and far-reaching that their discussion in an \nessay precludes any presentation of details, however desirable \nthis might be for clarity's sake.
