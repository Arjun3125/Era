A diagram of the proposed digital architecture for such services fea -\ntured only three parties: a closed loop that exclusively linked a person \nat home, her hospital’s servers, and her physician (Pattichis et al. 2002, \n143– 153). Digitalized information about one’s body was imagined as deeply \n“mine”: an inalienable extension of self with which one could choose to \nenrich already close relationships, such as those between a patient and \na trusted doctor or elderly parents and their adult children. In just a few \nyears, however, those 2002 schematics faded like an old daguerreotype.\nMany studies of health monitoring continue to emphasize its utility for \nthe elderly and other forms of remote care, but the conversation has deci -\nsively moved on from its earlier state of grace. Researchers anticipate the \nfusion of “smart cities” and what’s now called “m-health” to produce “smart \nhealth,” defined as “the provision of health services by using the context-  \naware network and sensing infrastructure of smart cities” (Solanas et al. \n2014, 74– 81). Toward that end, there are now reliable sensors for rendering \nan increasing range of physiological processes as behavioral data, including \nbody temperature, heart rate, brain activity, muscle motion, blood pres -\nsure, sweat rate, energy expenditure, and body and limb motion (Intille \net al. 2012, 24– 31; Mukhopadhyay 2015, 1321– 1330). There are sensors \nthat can render audio, visual, and physiological data during postsurgical \npatient recovery and rehabilitation (Castillejo et al. 2013, 38– 49). A flexi-\nble, sensored textile patch has been developed that can render breathing, \nThis is a portion of the eBook at doi:10.7551/mitpress/11304.001.0001\nDownloaded from http://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-edited-volume/chapter-pdf/2259403/9780262353946_caa.pdf by guest on 14 January 2026\n\f\n4 Shoshana Zuboff\nhand movements, swallowing, and walking as behavioral data (Cheng et \nal. 2013, 3935– 3947). In other applications, “wearable micromachined sen-\nsors” provide “accurate biomechanical analysis” as you walk or run, and \na “body area network” records and analyzes walking and running “under \nextreme conditions” (De Rossi and Veltink 2010, 37– 43).\nThese rich data can no longer be imagined as cloistered within the inti-\nmate closed loops of family and physician or even an application and its \ndieters or runners. By 2016, there were more than 100,000 mobile health \napps available on the Google Android and Apple iOS platforms, double the \nnumber in 2014 (Addonizio 2016). A legal review of mobile health apps \nconcludes that most of them “take the consumers’ private information and \ndata without the consumers’ permission and . . . do not generally disclose \nto the user that this information will be sent to advertising companies” \n(Dehling et al. 2015, 1– 26). These conclusions are borne out by a long \nqueue of studies.\nOne in- depth investigation focused on the collection, processing, and \nusage activities associated with nine prominent fitness trackers (Hilts et al. \n2016). All but two apps transmitted every logged fitness event to the com-\npany’s servers, which enabled backup and sharing with one’s friends but \nalso “data analytics” and distribution to third parties. Among many dis -\nturbing findings was the fact that some of the trackers transmitted device \nidentification numbers; others passively and continuously transmitted the \nuser’s precise longitude and latitude coordinates. These identifiers “could \nlink fitness and biographical data to a single mobile phone hardware, or \nsingle specific fitness wearable. . . .” None of this sensitive information was \nnecessary for the tracker to operate effectively, and most of the privacy pol-\nicies were opaque at best and allowed data to be “sold or exchanged with \nthird parties.” The researchers concluded, “We discovered severe security \nvulnerabilities, incredibly sensitive geolocation transmissions that serve no \napparent benefit to the end user, and . . . policies leaving the door open \nfor the sale of users’ fitness data to third parties without express consent \nof the users.”\nA comprehensive study of Android- based diabetes apps published in the \nJournal of American Medicine notes that while the US Food and Drug Admin-\nistration approved the prescription of a range of apps that transmit sensitive \nhealth data, the behind- the- scenes practices of these apps are “ understud-\nied” (italics mine; Blenner et al. 2016, 1051– 1052). Researchers examined \nThis is a portion of the eBook at doi:10.7551/mitpress/11304.001.0001\nDownloaded from http://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-edited-volume/chapter-pdf/2259403/9780262353946_caa.pdf by guest on 14 January 2026\n\f\n“We Make Them Dance” 5\n211 diabetes apps and randomly sampled 65 of them for close analysis of \ndata- transmission practices. In some of these apps, merely downloading the \nsoftware automatically “authorized collection and modification of sensitive \ninformation.” They identified many backstage operations, including apps \nthat modify or delete your information (64 percent), read your phone status \nand identity (31 percent), gather location data (27 percent), view your Wi- Fi \nconnections (12 percent), and activate your camera in order to access your \nphotos and videos (11 percent). Between 4 and 6 percent of the apps went \neven further: reading your contact lists, calling phone numbers found in \nyour device, modifying your contacts, reading your call log, and activating \nyour microphone to record your speech.\nThe research team concluded that privacy policies do not matter. Of the \n211 apps in the group, 81 percent did not have privacy policies, but for \nthose that did, “not all of the provisions actually protected privacy.” Of \nthose apps without privacy policies, 76 percent shared sensitive information \nwith third parties, and of those with privacy policies, 79 percent shared your \ndata while only about half admitted doing so in their published disclosures. \nIndeed, these discoveries suggest that the very notion of a “privacy pol -\nicy’ has become a dangerous euphemism, when such statements are better \nunderstood as “surveillance policies.”\nThe coda here is simple: Once I was mine. Now I am theirs . In 2002, inti-\nmate health and body information was assumed to be the possession of \nthe experiencing subject. Now, the same information is assumed to be the \npossession of the owners of the means by which it is produced. The experi-\nencing subject is transformed into a data object. This transformation reflects \nwhat might be thought of as a journey through the ontologies, econom -\nics, and politics of possession, alerting us to the qualities of existence and \npower that attend self- possession in contrast to dispossession. The journey \nfrom one to the other is not restricted to body information but rather illus-\ntrates a pattern that now engulfs every aspect of human experience. We \nmust therefore ask, what is it that determines these states of possession? \nWhat happened between 2002 and 2018 to decisively transform the onto -\nlogical, economic, and political structures of these information flows? This \nquestion is aimed at the early twenty- first century, but it is clarified in a \nuseful way with a quick backward glance.\n“We’ve stumbled along for a while, trying to run a new civilization in \nold ways, but we’ve got to start to make this world over.” It was 1912 when \nThis is a portion of the eBook at doi:10.7551/mitpress/11304.001.0001\nDownloaded from http://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-edited-volume/chapter-pdf/2259403/9780262353946_caa.pdf by guest on 14 January 2026\n\f\n6 Shoshana Zuboff\nThomas Edison laid out his vision for a new industrial civilization in a \nletter to Henry Ford. Edison worried that industrialism’s potential to serve \nthe progress of humanity would be thwarted by the stubborn power of the \nrobber barons and the monopolist economics that ruled their kingdoms. \nHe decried the “wastefulness” and “cruelty” of US capitalism: “Our pro -\nduction, our factory laws, our charities, our relations between capital and \nlabor, our distribution —all wrong, out of gear” (Nevins 1954, 532). Both \nEdison and Ford understood that the modern industrial civilization for \nwhich they harbored such hope was careening toward a darkness marked \nby industrial enslavement and grinding poverty for the many and prosper-\nity for the very few.\nThe two quintessentially American inventors agreed that the moral life \nof industrial civilization would be shaped by the practices of capitalism that \nrose to dominance in their time and the unbridled power that such prac -\ntices enjoyed, largely unimpeded by law, regulation, or jurisprudence. They \nbelieved that US society, and eventually the world, would have to fashion \na new, more rational capitalism in order to avert a future of misery and \nconflict. A new century had dawned, but the evolution of capitalism, like \nthe churning of civilizations, did not obey the calendar or the clock. It was \n1912, and still the nineteenth century’s Gilded Age refused to relinquish its \nclaim on the twentieth.\nThe same can be said of our time. Once more we look to the great struc-\ntural transformations of the market economy and its novel realizations of \ncapitalism to define our era, and once more we see their promise occluded \nby the emergence of a new quality of economic power whose effects are \nrevealed in a new kind of enslavement. What happened in the years \nbetween 2002 and 2018 was the emergence of a new surveillance capitalism, \nwhose mechanisms and operations are only imaginable within the digital \nmilieu (Zuboff 2014, 2015, 2016). Surveillance capitalism produces a new \nspecies of economic power that I call instrumentarianism. Together, the new \ncapitalism and its unique production of power are as untamed by law as \nwere the capitalism and economic power of the Gilded Age, and they are \njust as dangerous. Despite the many splendors of the digital milieu, surveil-\nlance capitalism and instrumentarian power now inscribe our lives with \ntheir unique signature of havoc, challenging human rights in ways that we \ndid not predict and could not anticipate. Many old inequalities are deep -\nened, while wholly new axes of exclusion and domination threaten every \nThis is a portion of the eBook at doi:10.7551/mitpress/11304.001.0001\nDownloaded from http://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-edited-volume/chapter-pdf/2259403/9780262353946_caa.pdf by guest on 14 January 2026\n\f\n“We Make Them Dance” 7\nunprotected dimension of human experience. Earlier contests over political \nrights are renewed, elemental human rights are abrogated, and even the \n“right to have rights” is under siege (Arendt 2004).\nIndeed, when it comes to the digital future and its consequences for \nhuman rights, a single point demands our attention: The challenges to \nhuman rights that we encounter in the digital era cannot be circumscribed \nby a specific technology or company, though they may be expressed in \ntechnological assemblies, such as algorithms and platforms, or in the prac-\ntices of a single corporation. Rather, the challenges we face originate in the \nrapid evolution of a new economic order  in which wealth is largely derived \nfrom surveillance— specifically, the unilateral dispossession of human experi -\nence for the sake of others’ profit.  As was the case in the twentieth century, \nthis new economic order seeks to fashion in its likeness human personal -\nity, society, civilization, and the frameworks of human rights that bind all \nthree. The sudden development of these conditions of existence means that \nif we are to claim the future for humanity, then new forms of collective \naction, resistance, and struggle are required. This chapter aims to contribute \nto such an undertaking by illuminating this triad: a novel capitalism, its \nnovel form of power, and their novel challenges to elemental human rights \nthat bear upon the production of autonomous action.\nWhat Is Surveillance Capitalism?1\nFramework\nThis effort to understand surveillance capitalism begins with the recog -\nnition that we hunt the puppet master, not the puppet.  A first challenge to \ncomprehension is the confusion between surveillance capitalism and the \ntechnologies it employs. Surveillance capitalism is not technology; it is a \nlogic that imbues technology and commands it into action. Surveillance \ncapitalism is a market form that is unimaginable outside the digital milieu, \nbut it is not the same as “the digital.” As is evident in the evolution of tele-\nmedicine, the digital can take many forms depending upon the social and \neconomic logics that direct it into action. It is the capitalism that assigns the \nprice tag of subjugation and helplessness, not the technology. In my view \nit is vital to understand that surveillance capitalism cannot be reduced to \n“platforms,” “algorithms,” “machine intelligence,” or any other technolog-\nical manifestation. While it is impossible to imagine surveillance capitalism \nThis is a portion of the eBook at doi:10.7551/mitpress/11304.001.0001\nDownloaded from http://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-edited-volume/chapter-pdf/2259403/9780262353946_caa.pdf by guest on 14 January 2026\n\f\n8 Shoshana Zuboff\nwithout the affordances of the digital, it is perfectly possible to imagine \nthese technologies and capabilities without surveillance capitalism.\nThat technologies are always economic means, not ends in themselves, \nis not a new point. Max Weber called attention to this “economic orienta-\ntion,” observing that economic ends are always intrinsic to technology’s \ndevelopment and deployment. “Economic action” determines objectives, \nwhereas technology provides “appropriate means.” In Weber’s framing, \n“The fact that what is called the technological development of modern \ntimes has been so largely oriented economically to profit- making is one of \nthe fundamental facts of the history of technology” (Weber 1978, 67). In a \nmodern capitalist society, technology is, was, and always will be an expres-\nsion of the economic objectives that direct it into action. A worthwhile \nexercise would be to delete the word “technology” from our vocabularies in \norder to see how quickly capitalism’s objectives are exposed.\nThe primacy of economics over technology is not new, but capitalism \nhas long found it useful to conceal itself within the Trojan horse of tech -\nnology in order that we might perceive its excesses as the inevitable expres-\nsion of the machines it employs. Surveillance capitalists are no exception. \nFor example, in 2009 the public first became aware that Google maintains \nsearch histories indefinitely. When questioned about these practices, the \ncorporation’s former CEO Eric Schmidt explained, “. . . the reality is that \nsearch engines including Google do retain this information for some time” \n(Newman 2009). In truth, search engines do not retain, but surveillance \ncapitalism does. Schmidt’s statement is a classic of misdirection that bewil-\nders the public by conflating commercial imperatives and technological \nnecessity. It camouflages the concrete practices of surveillance capitalism \nand the specific choices that impelled Google’s brand of search into action. \nMost significantly, it makes surveillance capitalism’s practices appear to \nbe inevitable, when they are actually meticulously calculated and lavishly \nfunded means to self- dealing commercial ends.\nJust as surveillance capitalism is not the same as technology, this new \nlogic of accumulation cannot be reduced to any single corporation or group \nof corporations. Surveillance capitalism first rooted and flourished at Goo-\ngle and Facebook, then quickly became the default mode for most Internet \nbusinesses, startups, and apps. By now surveillance capitalism can no longer \nbe thought of as restricted to individual companies or even to the Internet \nsector. It has spread across a wide range of products, services, and economic \nThis is a portion of the eBook at doi:10.7551/mitpress/11304.001.0001\nDownloaded from http://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-edited-volume/chapter-pdf/2259403/9780262353946_caa.pdf by guest on 14 January 2026\n\f\n“We Make Them Dance” 9\nsectors, including insurance, retail, health care, finance, entertainment, \neducation, transportation, and more, birthing whole new ecosystems of \nsuppliers, producers, customers, market- makers, and market players. Nearly \nevery product or service that begins with the word “smart” or “personal -\nized,” every Internet- enabled device, every “digital assistant,” operates as a \nsupply- chain interface for the unobstructed flow of behavioral data.\nSurveillance capitalism was invented at Google, where its logic and foun-\ndational mechanisms were discovered and elaborated between 2001 and \n2004 in much the same way that General Motors invented and perfected \nmanagerial capitalism a century ago. Google was the pathfinder of surveil-\nlance capitalism in thought and practice, the deep pocket for research and \ndevelopment, and the catalyst in experimentation and implementation. As \nthe pioneer of surveillance capitalism, Google launched an unprecedented \nmarket operation into the unmapped spaces of the Internet where it faced \nfew impediments from law or competitors, like an invasive species in a \nlandscape free of natural predators. Its leaders drove the systemic coher -\nence of their businesses at a breakneck pace that neither public institutions \nnor individuals could follow. Indeed, both speed and secrecy were carefully \ncrafted strategies of shock and awe essential to the company’s larger ambi-\ntions of market dominance (Zuboff, 2019).\nSurveillance capitalism originates in history, not in technological inev -\nitability. Google’s discovery and pursuit of surveillance capitalism cannot \nbe separated from the unique historical conditions that first motivated the \nurgent search for a new market form and later nurtured and sheltered its \nnew mechanisms of accumulation. Specifically, the young company faced \nextreme pressure from its investors in the teeth of the 2001 financial crisis \nin Silicon Valley. Surveillance capitalism was invented as the solution to \nthis financial emergency. It proved itself a rapid methodology for the trans-\nlation of investment into revenue and capital. Google also benefitted from \nhistorical circumstance, when a national security apparatus galvanized by \nthe attacks of 9/11 was inclined to nurture, mimic, shelter, and appropriate \nsurveillance capitalism’s emergent capabilities for the sake of total knowl-\nedge and its promise of total certainty. These dynamics comprise a political \ncondition that I call surveillance exceptionalism.\nThe combination of financial success and the politics of surveillance \nexceptionalism transformed the new logic of accumulation into the default \nmodel of information capitalism. Surveillance capitalism migrated to \nThis is a portion of the eBook at doi:10.7551/mitpress/11304.001.0001\nDownloaded from http://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-edited-volume/chapter-pdf/2259403/9780262353946_caa.pdf by guest on 14 January 2026\n\f\n10 Shoshana Zuboff\nFacebook with Google- turned- Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg and \nlater took hold at Microsoft under the leadership of CEO Satya Nadella. \nEvidence suggests that Amazon has veered toward surveillance capitalism. \nThe lure of surveillance revenue remains a constant challenge to Apple, \nboth as an external threat and as a source of internal debate and conflict. \nSurveillance capitalism is no longer confined to the competitive dramas \nof the large Internet companies as competitive intensity eventually drove \nexpansion into the offline world. Its economic imperatives and founda -\ntional mechanisms now spread across every economic sector and category \nof goods and services.\n“Laws of Motion”\nBorrowed from Newton’s laws of inertia, force, and equal and opposite reac-\ntions, “laws of motion” is a metaphor that has been used to describe the nec-\nessary and predictable features of industrial capitalism (Marx 1992, 91– 92; \nWood 2002, 76, 93, 125). While surveillance capitalism does not abandon \nestablished capitalist “laws” such as competitive production, profit maxi -\nmization, productivity, and growth, these earlier dynamics now operate in \nthe context of a new logic of accumulation that also introduces its own sui \ngeneris laws of motion. Surveillance capitalism is defined by new economic \nimperatives whose mechanisms and effects cannot be grasped with existing \nmodels and assumptions. This is not to say that the old imperatives —a \ncompulsion toward profit maximization along with the intensification \nof the means of production, growth, and competition —have vanished. \nRather, these must now operate through the novel aims and mechanisms \nof a new market form. Most people credit Google’s success to its advertising \nmodel. But the discoveries that led to Google’s rapid rise in revenue and \nmarket capitalization are only incidentally related to advertising. Google’s \nsuccess derives from its ability to predict the future—specifically the future \nof human behavior.\nThe Rendition of Experience: Human– Natural Resources\nFrom the start, Google had collected data on users’ search- related behavior \nas a by- product of query activity. Back then, these data logs were treated \nas waste, not even safely or methodically stored. Eventually, the young \ncompany came to understand that these logs could be used to teach and \ncontinuously improve its search engine. The problem was this:  Serving \nThis is a portion of the eBook at doi:10.7551/mitpress/11304.001.0001\nDownloaded from http://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-edited-volume/chapter-pdf/2259403/9780262353946_caa.pdf by guest on 14 January 2026\n\f\n“We Make Them Dance” 11\nusers with effective search results “used up” all the value that users cre -\nated when they inadvertently provided behavioral data. It was a complete \nand self- contained process in which users were ends in themselves. All the \nvalue that users created was reinvested in their experience in the form of \nimproved search, a progression that I have called the behavioral value rein -\nvestment cycle. In this interaction, there was nothing “left over,” no surplus \nfor Google to turn into capital. As long as the effectiveness of the search \nengine needed users’ behavioral data about as much as users needed search, \ncharging a fee for service was too risky. In 2001 Google was remarkable, but \nit wasn’t yet capitalism—just one of many Internet start- ups that boasted \n“eyeballs” but no revenue.\nThe year 2001 brought the dot.com bust and mounting investor pres -\nsures at Google. Back then, advertisers selected the search term pages for \ntheir displays. Google decided to try and boost ad revenue by applying its \nalready substantial analytical capabilities to the challenge of increasing an \nad’s relevance to users—and thus its value to advertisers. Operationally, this \nmeant that Google would finally repurpose its growing cache of “useless” \nbehavioral data. Now the data would be used to match ads with keywords, \nexploiting subtleties that only its access to behavioral data, combined with \nits analytical capabilities, could reveal.\nIt’s now clear that this shift in the use of behavioral data was an his -\ntoric turning point. Behavioral data that were once discarded or ignored \nwere rediscovered as what I call behavioral surplus: data reserves that are \nmore than what is required for product and service improvements. Google’s \ndramatic success in “matching” ads to pages revealed the transformational \nvalue of this behavioral surplus as a means of generating revenue and ulti-\nmately turning investment into revenue.\nKey to this formula was the fact that this new market exchange was not \nan exchange with users but rather with companies who understood how \nto make money from bets on users’ future behavior. In this new context, \nusers were no longer ends in themselves. Instead, they became a means to \nprofits in a new behavioral futures market in which users are neither buyers \nnor sellers nor products. Users are instead the human nature- al source of \nfree raw material that feeds a new kind of manufacturing process designed \nto fabricate prediction products. These products are calculations that predict \nwhat individuals and groups will do now, soon, and later. The more raw \nmaterials that are fed into this new machine intelligence– based “means of \nThis is a portion of the eBook at doi:10.7551/mitpress/11304.001.0001\nDownloaded from http://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-edited-volume/chapter-pdf/2259403/9780262353946_caa.pdf by guest on 14 January 2026\n\f\n12 Shoshana Zuboff\nproduction,” the more powerful are its prediction products. While these \nprocesses were initially aimed at online ad targeting, they are no more \nrestricted to that application than mass production was restricted to the \nmanufacture of automobiles, where it was first applied at scale.\nMany of the facts I describe here are well- known, but their significance \nhas not been fully appreciated or adequately theorized. Google and other \nsurveillance platforms are sometimes described as “two- sided” or “multi- \nsided” markets (Rochet and Tirole 2006, 645– 667), but the mechanisms of \nsurveillance capitalism suggest something different. Google had discovered \na way to translate its nonmarket interactions with users into surplus raw \nmaterial for the fabrication of products aimed at genuine market transac -\ntions with its real customers: advertisers (Strandburg 2013). The translation \nof human experience outside the market to behavioral data that circulates \ninside the market finally enabled Google to convert investment into reve -\nnue. The corporation thus created out of thin air and at zero marginal cost \nan asset class of vital raw materials derived from users’ nonmarket online \nexperience. At first those raw materials were simply “found,” a by- product \nof users’ search action. Later those assets were hunted aggressively, pro -\ncured, and accumulated —largely through unilateral operations designed \nto evade individual awareness and thus bypass individual decision rights—\noperations that are therefore best summarized as “surveillance.”\nThat behavioral surplus became the defining element of Google’s success \nwas well understood by its leaders. Google’s former CEO Eric Schmidt cred-\nits Hal Varian’s early development of the firm’s ad auctions with providing \nthe eureka moment that clarified the true nature of Google’s business— “All \nof a sudden, we realized we were in the auction business”— referring to the \nautomated behavioral futures markets deployed in ad targeting (Polanyi \n2001, 75– 76). Larry Page is credited with a very different and far more \ninsightful answer to the question “What is Google?” Google’s first brand \nmanager, Douglas Edwards, recounts a 2001 session with the founders that \nprobed their answers to that precise query. It was Page who ruminated, “If \nwe did have a category, it would be personal information. . . . The places \nyou’ve seen. Communications. . . . Sensors are really cheap. . . . Storage \nis cheap. Cameras are cheap. People will generate enormous amounts of \ndata. . . . Everything you’ve ever heard or seen or experienced will become \nsearchable. Your whole life will be searchable” (Edwards 2011, 291).\nThis is a portion of the eBook at doi:10.7551/mitpress/11304.001.0001\nDownloaded from http://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-edited-volume/chapter-pdf/2259403/9780262353946_caa.pdf by guest on 14 January 2026\n\f\n“We Make Them Dance” 13\nPage’s vision perfectly reflects the history of capitalism as a process of \ntaking things that live outside the market sphere and declaring their new \nlife as market commodities. In historian Karl Polanyi’s 1944 grand narra -\ntive of the “great transformation” to a self- regulating market economy, he \ndescribed the origins of this translation process in three astonishing and \ncrucial mental inventions that he called “commodity fictions.” The first \nwas that human life could be subordinated to market dynamics and reborn \nas “labor” to be bought and sold. The second was that nature could be trans-\nlated into the market and reborn as “land” or “real estate.” The third was \nthat exchange could be reborn as “money” (Polanyi 2001, 75– 76). Nearly \neighty years earlier, Karl Marx had described the taking of lands and natural \nresources as the original “big bang” that ignited modern capital formation, \ncalling it “primitive accumulation” (Marx 1992).\nPage grasped that human experience would be Google’s virgin wood—\nthat it could be extracted at no extra cost online and at a low marginal cost \nout in the real world, where “sensors are really cheap,” thus producing a \nsurplus as the basis of a wholly new class of market exchange. Surveillance \ncapitalism originates in this act of digital dispossession, operationalized in \nthe rendition of human experience as behavioral data. This is the lever that \nmoved Google’s world and shifted it toward profit, changing the trajec -\ntory of information capitalism as it claimed undefended human experience \nfor a market dynamic that would encounter no impediment in the lawless \nspaces of the Internet.\nThe significance of behavioral surplus was lost in euphemism, both \nat Google and throughout the Internet industry, with labels like “digital \nexhaust,” “digital breadcrumbs,” and so on.2 These euphemisms for behav-\nioral surplus operate as ideological filters in exactly the same way that the \nearliest maps of the North American continent labeled whole regions with \nterms like “heathens,” “infidels,” “idolaters,” “primitives,” “vassals,” or \n“rebels.” On the strength of those labels, native peoples, their places and \nclaims, were erased from the invaders’ moral and legal equations, legitimat-\ning their acts of taking and breaking in the name of Church and Monarchy.\nIn the case of surveillance capitalism, camouflage and other methodol -\nogies of secrecy aim to prevent interruption of critical supply- chain oper-\nations that begin with the rendition of human experience and end with \nthe delivery of behavioral data to machine intelligence– based production \nThis is a portion of the eBook at doi:10.7551/mitpress/11304.001.0001\nDownloaded from http://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-edited-volume/chapter-pdf/2259403/9780262353946_caa.pdf by guest on 14 January 2026\n\f\n14 Shoshana Zuboff\nsystems. These operations of secrecy by design turn us into exiles from our \nown behavior, denied access to or control over knowledge derived from our \nexperience. Knowledge and power rest with surveillance capital, for which \nwe are merely “human natural” resources. We are the native peoples, now, \nwhose tacit claims to self- determination have vanished from the maps of \nour own lives.\nTo be sure, there are always sound business reasons for hiding the loca -\ntion of your gold mine. In Google’s case, an explicit “hiding strategy” \naccrued to its competitive advantage, but there were other, more pressing \nreasons for concealment and obfuscation (Levy 2011, 69). Douglas Edwards \nwrites compellingly about the corporation’s culture of secrecy: According to \nhis account, Larry Page and Sergey Brin were “hawks,” insisting on aggres-\nsive data capture and retention. “Larry opposed any path that would reveal \nour technological secrets or stir the privacy pot and endanger our ability to \ngather data.” Page wanted to avoid arousing users’ curiosity by minimizing \ntheir exposure to any clues about the reach of the firm’s data operations. \nHe questioned the prudence of the electronic scroll in the reception lobby \nthat displays a continuous stream of search queries, and he “tried to kill” \nthe annual Google Zeitgeist conference that summarizes the year’s trends in \nsearch terms (Edwards 2011, 340– 345).\nWhat might the response have been back then if the public were told \nthat Google’s magic derived from its exclusive capabilities in unilateral \nsurveillance of online behavior and methods specifically designed to over-\nride awareness and thus individual decision rights? Secrecy was required \nin order to protect operations designed to be undetectable because they \ntook things from users without asking and employed those illegitimately \nclaimed resources to work in the service of others’ purposes.\nThat Google was able to choose secrecy is itself testament to the success \nof its own claims and an illustration of the difference between “decision \nrights” and “privacy.” Decision rights confer the power to choose whether \nto keep something secret or to share it. One can choose the degree of pri -\nvacy or transparency for each situation. US Supreme Court Justice William \nO. Douglas articulated this view of privacy in 1967: “Privacy involves the \nchoice of the individual to disclose or to reveal what he believes, what he \nthinks, what he possesses” (Douglas 1967; Farahany 2012). Surveillance \ncapitalism laid claim to these decision rights.\nThis is a portion of the eBook at doi:10.7551/mitpress/11304.001.0001\nDownloaded from http://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-edited-volume/chapter-pdf/2259403/9780262353946_caa.pdf by guest on 14 January 2026\n\f\n“We Make Them Dance” 15\nThe typical complaint is that privacy is eroded, but that is misleading. \nIn the larger societal pattern, privacy is not eroded but redistributed, as \ndecision rights over privacy are claimed for surveillance capital. Instead of \nmany people having the right to decide how and what they will disclose, \nthese rights are concentrated within the domain of surveillance capitalism. \nGoogle discovered this necessary element of the new logic of accumulation: \nit must declare its rights to take the information upon which its success \ndepends. The extraordinary financial power of surveillance capitalism’s \nhidden inventions was only revealed when Google went public in 2004. \nAt that time it became clear that on the strength of its secrets, the firm’s \nrevenue had increased 3,590 percent in less than four years.\nToday’s owners of surveillance capital have thus declared a fourth fic -\ntional commodity expropriated from the experiential realities of human \nbeings whose bodies, thoughts, and feelings are as blameless as nature’s \nonce plentiful meadows and forests before they fell to the market dynamic. \nIn this new logic, human experience is subjugated to surveillance capitalism’s \nmarket mechanisms and rendered as “behavior.” Behavior is reduced to data, \nready to take their place in a numberless queue that feeds the machines for \nfabrication into predictions and eventual exchange in behavioral futures \nmarkets. The experiencing individual is not essential to this market action, \nexcept as the source of raw material.\nThe summary of these developments is that the behavioral surplus \nupon which Google’s fortune rests can be considered as surveillance assets. \nThese assets are critical raw materials in the pursuit of surveillance customers \nfor the sake of surveillance revenues  and their translation into surveillance \ncapital. The entire logic of this capital accumulation is most accurately \nunderstood as surveillance capitalism, which is the foundational framework \nof a surveillance- based economic order: a surveillance economy.  The big \npattern here is one of subordination and hierarchy, in which earlier reci -\nprocities between the firm and its users are subordinated to the derivative \nproject of behavioral surplus captured for others’ market aims. Individual \n“users” are not the subjects of value realization. Nor are they, as some have \ninsisted, “the product” in the sales process. Instead, they are the objects \nfrom which raw materials are extracted and expropriated for Google’s pre-\ndiction factories: they are the means to others’ ends.

The \nquality of prediction products depends upon volume inputs to machine \nprocesses. Volume surplus is thus a competitive requirement. This dynamic \nestablishes the extraction imperative, which expresses the necessity of econo-\nmies of scale in surplus accumulation  and depends upon automated systems \nthat relentlessly track, hunt, and induce more behavioral surplus. These \nsystems, which began in the online environment and later spread to the \n“real” world, constitute an extraction architecture that has evolved in the \ndirection of ubiquity, just as Larry Page anticipated in 2001 and as the evo-\nlution of digital “health” information amply demonstrates. Under the lash \nof the extraction imperative, the once simple closed loops have been trans-\nformed into a global, sensate, computational, connected architecture of \nbehavioral surplus capture and analysis, fulfilling computer scientist Mark \nWeiser’s 1999 vision of “ubiquitous computing” memorialized in two leg-\nendary sentences: “The most profound technologies are those that disap -\npear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are \nindistinguishable from it” (Weiser 1999).\nThe Prediction Imperative: Economies of Scope\nSurveillance profits awakened intense competition over the revenues that \nflow from behavioral futures markets. In this second phase of competitive \nintensity, the volume of surplus became a necessary but insufficient condi-\ntion for success. Even the most sophisticated process of converting behav -\nioral surplus into products that accurately forecast the future is only as good \nas the raw material available for processing. In the race for higher degrees \nof certainty, it became clear that the best predictions would have to approx-\nimate observation. The next threshold was defined by the quality, not just \nthe quantity, of behavioral surplus. These pressures led to a search for new \nsupplies of surplus that would more reliably foretell the future. This marks \na critical turning point in the trial- and- error elaboration of surveillance \nThis is a portion of the eBook at doi:10.7551/mitpress/11304.001.0001\nDownloaded from http://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-edited-volume/chapter-pdf/2259403/9780262353946_caa.pdf by guest on 14 January 2026\n\f\n“We Make Them Dance” 17\ncapitalism and crystallizes a second economic imperative— the prediction \nimperative— as the expression of these competitive forces. The prediction \nimperative drives the diversification of extraction architectures to accom -\nmodate, first, economies of scope in surplus accumulation and, later, econ-\nomies of action.\nThe shift toward economies of scope represents a new set of aims: behav-\nioral surplus must be vast, but it must also be varied. These variations have \nbeen developed along two dimensions. The first is the extension of extraction \noperations from the virtual world into the “real” world of embodied human \nexperience. Surveillance capitalists understood that their future wealth \nwould depend upon new supply routes that extend to real life on the roads, \namong the trees, throughout the cities. Extension wants your bloodstream \nand your bed, your breakfast conversation, your commute, your run, your \nrefrigerator, your parking space, your living room, your pancreas.\nEconomies of scope also proceed along a second depth dimension. The \nidea here is that more predictive, and therefore more lucrative, behavioral \nsurplus can be plumbed from intimate patterns of the self. These supply \noperations are aimed at your personality, moods, and emotions; your lies \nand vulnerabilities. (For a detailed discussion, see Zuboff 2019, chapters 8 \nand 9.) Emergent rendition techniques are trained on successive levels of \nintimacy where new supplies can be automatically captured and flattened \ninto a tidal flow of data points that proceed toward manufactured certainty.\nAs the prediction imperative drives deeper into the self, the value of \nits surplus becomes irresistible, and the competitive pressures to corner \nlucrative sources of supply escalate. It is no longer a matter of surveillance \ncapital wringing surplus from what I search, buy, and browse. Surveillance \ncapital wants more than my body’s coordinates in time and space. Now it \nviolates the inner sanctum, as machines and their algorithms decide the \nmeaning of my sighs, blinks, and utterances; the pattern of my breathing \nand the movements of my eyes; my jaw muscles; the hitch in my voice; \nand the exclamation points in a Facebook post that I offered in innocence \nand hope.\nThere are many glosses that divert attention from the logic of these oper-\nations and their economic origins: “ambient computing,” “ubiquitous com-\nputing,” and the “Internet of Things” are but a few examples. The labels \ndiffer, but they share a consistent vision: the everywhere, always- on instru-\nmentation, datafication, connection, communication, and computation \nThis is a portion of the eBook at doi:10.7551/mitpress/11304.001.0001\nDownloaded from http://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-edited-volume/chapter-pdf/2259403/9780262353946_caa.pdf by guest on 14 January 2026"

Just as scale became necessary \nbut insufficient for higher quality predictions, the demands of the predic -\ntion imperative eventually encountered the limitations of economies of \nscope. While behavioral surplus must be vast and varied, surveillance capi-\ntalists gradually came to understand that the surest way to predict behavior \nis to intervene at its source and shape it. The processes invented to achieve \nthis goal are what I call economies of action.\nEconomies of scale and scope are well- known industrial logics, but econ-\nomies of action are distinct to surveillance capitalism and its digital milieu. \nIn order to achieve these economies, machine processes are configured to \nintervene in the state of play in the real world among real people and things. \nThese interventions are designed to augment prediction products in order \nthat they approximate certainty by “tuning,” “herding,” and condition -\ning the behavior of individuals, groups, and populations. These economies \nof action apply techniques that are as varied as inserting a specific phrase \ninto your Facebook news feed, timing the appearance of a BUY button on \nyour phone with the rise of your endorphins at the end of a run, shutting \ndown your car engine when an insurance payment is late, or employing \npopulation- scale behavioral microtargeting drawn from Facebook profiles. \nIndeed, the notorious manipulations of the data firm Cambridge Analytica, \nwhich scandalized the world in 2018, simply appropriated the means and \nmethods that are now both standard and necessary operations in the sur -\nveillance capitalism arsenal (Zuboff 2019, 295– 330).\nAs the prediction imperative gathers force, it gradually becomes clear \nthat economies of scale and scope were the first phases of a more ambi -\ntious project. Economies of action mean that ubiquitous machine archi -\ntectures must be able to know as well as to do. What began as an extraction \nThis is a portion of the eBook at doi:10.7551/mitpress/11304.001.0001\nDownloaded from http://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-edited-volume/chapter-pdf/2259403/9780262353946_caa.pdf by guest on 14 January 2026\n\f\n“We Make Them Dance” 19\narchitecture now doubles as an execution architecture through which hidden \neconomic objectives are imposed upon the vast and varied field of behav -\nior. As surveillance capitalism’s imperatives and the material infrastructures \nthat perform extraction and execution operations begin to function as a \ncoherent whole, they produce a twenty- first- century means of behavioral \nmodification to which the means of production is subordinated as merely \none part of this larger whole.\nThe means of behavioral modification does not aim to compel confor -\nmity to or compliance with social norms, as has been the case with earlier \napplications of the behaviorist paradigm. Rather, this new complex aims \nto produce behavior that reliably, definitively, and certainly leads to pre -\ndicted commercial results for surveillance customers. The research director \nof Gartner, the respected business advisory and research firm, makes the \npoint unambiguously when he observes that mastery of the “Internet of \nThings” will serve as “a key enabler in the transformation of business mod-\nels from ‘guaranteed levels of performance’ to ‘guaranteed outcomes’” (italics \nmine; Pettey 2016). This is an extraordinary statement, because there can \nbe no such guarantees in the absence of the power to make it so. The wider \ncomplex of “the means of behavioral modification” is the expression of this \ngathering power. The prospect of businesses competing on the promise of \nguaranteed outcomes enabled by a global digital architecture alerts us to \nthe force of the prediction imperative, which now demands that surveil -\nlance capitalists make the future for the sake of predicting it.\nSurveillance capitalists’ interests have shifted from using automated \nmachine processes to know about your behavior to using machine pro -\ncesses to shape your behavior according to their interests. Given the con -\nditions of increasing ubiquity, it has become difficult, if not impossible, \nto escape this web. Under this regime, ubiquitous computing is not just a \nknowing machine; it is an actuating machine designed to produce more \ncertainty about us and for them. The nearly two- decade trajectory since the \ncollection and analysis of health data was conceived as a simple closed loop \nhas taken us from automating information flows about behavior to auto-\nmating behavior. Just as industrial capitalism was driven to the continuous \nintensification of the means of production, so surveillance capitalists are \nnow locked in a cycle of continuous intensification of the means of behav -\nioral modification. While it is possible to imagine something like a ubiqui -\ntous, connected, sensate computational architecture without surveillance \nThis is a portion of the eBook at doi:10.7551/mitpress/11304.001.0001\nDownloaded from http://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-edited-volume/chapter-pdf/2259403/9780262353946_caa.pdf by guest on 14 January 2026\n\f\n20 Shoshana Zuboff\ncapitalism, the means of behavioral modification depend entirely on this \npervasive networked architecture.\nEconomies of scale and scope ignored privacy norms and laws, relying \non weak legitimation processes like “sadistic contracts” and meaningless \nmechanisms of notice and consent to accumulate decision rights in the \nsurveillance capitalist domain (Bakos, et al. 2014; Becher and Zarsky 2015; \nKar 2013; Kim 2013; Preston 2015; Radin 2012). But economies of action \ngo further. These new systems and procedures take direct aim at individual \nautonomy, systematically replacing self- determined action with a range of \nhidden operations designed to shape behavior at the source. Economies \nof action are constructed through systematic experimentation that began \nwith apparent banalities like the A/B testing of web- page design elements \nand eventually progressed to more complex undertakings. One example is \nthe secret manipulation of social contagion demonstrated in Facebook’s \nvast experiments in shaping social behavior, about which the corporation’s \nresearchers concluded, “Emotional states can be transferred to others via \nemotional contagion, leading people to experience the same emotions \nwithout their awareness. . . . Online messages influence our experience of \nemotions, which may affect a variety of offline behaviors” (Kramer, Guil -\nlory, and Hancock 2014). Another is the population- scale social herding \nexperiments popularized by the Google- incubated augmented reality appli-\ncation of Niantic Labs’ Pokémon Go, in which innocent players are herded \nto eat, drink, and purchase in the restaurants, bars, fast- food joints, and \nshops that pay to play in the company’s behavioral futures markets (see the \ndiscussion in Zuboff 2019).\nUltimately behavioral modification capabilities are institutionalized in \n“innovative” commercial practices in which individuals fund their own \ndomination. One finds digital tuning, herding, and conditioning embedded \nin such varied practices as the insurance industry’s embrace of “behavioral \nunderwriting,” the gamification of retailing, the remote- control opera -\ntions of automotive telematics, or the “personalized services” of so- called \n“digital assistants” such as Amazon’s “Alexa,” Google’s “Google Assistant,” \nand Microsoft’s “Cortana.” What they share is the explicit aim to produce \nplanned behavioral outcomes with methods of behavioral modification \nthat operate through unprecedented and proprietary digital architectures, \nwhile carefully circumventing the awareness of human targets.\nThis is a portion of the eBook at doi:10.7551/mitpress/11304.001.0001\nDownloaded from http://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-edited-volume/chapter-pdf/2259403/9780262353946_caa.pdf by guest on 14 January 2026\n\f\n“We Make Them Dance” 21\nThe conflation of economic imperatives and behavior modification at \nscale locates the surveillance capitalist project squarely in the paradigm of \nradical behaviorism associated with B. F. Skinner, which draws upon for -\nmulations in early theoretical physics, especially the philosophical work of \nMax Planck (2007a, 2007b). Following Planck, radical behaviorism insists \non the reduction of human experience to observable, measurable behavior \npurged of inwardness, thus establishing psychological science as the objec-\ntive study of behaving objects comparable to the research paradigms of the \nnatural sciences. Max Meyer, a student of Planck’s and the early- twentieth- \ncentury experimental psychologist most admired by Skinner, called this \napproach “the psychology of the Other- One” (Skinner 1991, 4– 6; see also \nMeyer 1921). Human behavior would yield to scientific inquiry only if \npsychologists learned to view humans as “others,” a “viewpoint of obser -\nvation” considered an absolute requirement for an “objective science of \nhuman behaviour” (Meyer 1912, 371). Central to this new viewpoint was \nMeyer’s insistence that the human being should be regarded as an “organ-\nism among organisms,” distinguishable from a lettuce, a moose, or an inch-\nworm only in degree of complexity (Esper 1967, 114; Meyer 1912, 1921).\nSkinner embraced Meyer’s “viewpoint of observation,” which led to his \ndiscovery of the principles of “operant conditioning” in which a carefully \ndesigned “schedule of reinforcements” is imposed on the animal in order \nto shape specific behavioral patterns by amplifying some actions at the \nexpense of others. While Skinner focused his work on mice and pigeons, \nthe epistemology of radical behaviorism enabled easy generalizations across \nspecies (Blanshard 1967; Meyer 1912, 1921; Skinner 1976, 1991, 2002, \n2012; Wozniak 1997). Even the complexities of human reasoning, choice, \nproblem- solving, and reflection render themselves to the viewpoint of the \nOther- One:\nWhen a man controls himself, chooses a course of action, thinks out the solution to \na problem, or strives toward an increase in self- knowledge, he is behaving. He con-\ntrols himself precisely as he would control the behavior of anyone else— through \nthe manipulation of variables of which behavior is a function. His behavior in so \ndoing is a proper object of analysis, and eventually it must be accounted for with \nvariables lying outside the individual himself. (Skinner 2012, 228– 229)\nIt was Skinner who first imagined a ubiquitous “technology of behavior” \nthat would enable the application of operant conditioning across entire \nThis is a portion of the eBook at doi:10.7551/mitpress/11304.001.0001\nDownloaded from http://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-edited-volume/chapter-pdf/2259403/9780262353946_caa.pdf by guest on 14 January 2026\n\f\n22 Shoshana Zuboff\nhuman populations. He argued that “the field of human behavior” would \nnever achieve scientific status without “instruments and methods” as pow-\nerful as those available to physicists and biologists (Skinner 2002, 4– 5). Such \ninstruments would finally illuminate the laws of human action, enabling \nscientists to shape and predict behavior.\nThere would be challenges. New technologies of behavior would have \nto continually push the envelope of the public– private divide in order \nto access all the data relevant to behavioral prediction and control. Like \ntoday’s surveillance capitalists, Skinner was confident that the slow drip of \ntechnological invention would eventually push privacy to the margins of \nhuman experience, where it would join “freedom,” “autonomy,” and other \ntroublesome illusions. All of these would be replaced by the viewpoint of \nthe Other- One embodied in new instruments and methods:\nThe line between public and private is not fixed. The boundary shifts with every \ndiscovery of a technique for making private events public. Behavior which is \nof such small magnitude that it is not ordinarily observed may be amplified. \nCovert verbal behavior may be detected in slight movements of the speech appa-\nratus. . . . The problem of privacy may, therefore, eventually be solved by tech -\nnical advances . . . we are still faced with events which occur at the private level \nand which are important to the organism without instrumental amplification. \nHow the organism reacts to these events will remain an important question, \neven though the events may some day be made accessible to everyone. (Skinner \n2012, 282)\nSkinner’s technologies of behavior have finally come to life as a market \nproject. The conflation of economic orientation, the means of behavioral \nmodification, and the digital architectures and devices that are its medium \nare now a taken- for- granted feature of the surveillance capitalist milieu. \nThis theme and the necessity of its concealment are reiterated throughout \nthe interviews that I conducted with data scientists and software engineers \nbetween 2012 and 2015 as one element of a larger study of surveillance \ncapitalism.3 The means of behavioral modification are the subject of cre -\native elaboration, experimentation, and application, but always outside the \nawareness of its human targets. For example, the chief data scientist for a \nnational drugstore chain described how his company designs automated \ndigital reinforcers to subtly tune customers’ behaviors: “You can make peo-\nple do things with this technology. Even if it’s just 5% of people, you’ve \nmade 5% of people do an action they otherwise wouldn’t have done, so to \nThis is a portion of the eBook at doi:10.7551/mitpress/11304.001.0001\nDownloaded from http://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-edited-volume/chapter-pdf/2259403/9780262353946_caa.pdf by guest on 14 January 2026\n\f\n“We Make Them Dance” 23\nsome extent there is an element of the user’s loss of self- control.” A soft-\nware engineer specializing in the Internet of Things explained his compa -\nny’s approach to conditioning: “The goal of everything we do is to change \npeople’s actual behavior at scale . . . we can capture their behaviors and \nidentify good and bad. Then we develop ‘treatments’ or ‘data pellets’ that \nselect good behaviors.” Another recounted the operational mechanisms of \nherding: “We can engineer the context around a particular behavior and \nforce change that way. . . . We are learning how to write the music, and then we \nlet the music make them dance.”\nHow do they get away with it? Dozens of surveys conducted since 2008 \nattest to substantial majorities in the United States, the EU, and around the \nworld that reject the premises and practices of surveillance capitalism, yet \nit persists, succeeds, and dominates. In other work I have detailed sixteen \nfactors that enabled this new logic of accumulation to root and flourish \n(Zuboff 2019), and here I want to underscore two of these.\nThe first is dependency. Surveillance capitalism now controls many of \nthe operations that are essential for social participation. Early on, the free \nservices of Google, Facebook, and other applications appealed to the latent \nneeds of second- modernity individuals seeking resources for effective \nlife in an increasingly hostile institutional environment (Beck and Beck-  \nGernsheim 2002; Zuboff and Maxmin 2002). Once bitten, the apple was \nirresistible. A 2010 BBC poll found that 79 percent of people in twenty- six \ncountries considered Internet access to be a fundamental human right (BBC \n2010). Six years later, in 2016, the United Nations Human Rights Council \nwould adopt specific language on the importance of Internet access. In the \nUnited States, many people call the emergency services number, 911, on \nthose rare occasions when Facebook is down (LA Times 2014). Most people \nfind it difficult to withdraw from these utilities, and many ponder if it is \neven possible (Alter 2017; Andreassen et al. 2012; Casale and Fioravanti \n2015; Cheng and Li 2014; Dreifus 2017; Griffiths, Kuss, and Demetrovics \n2014; Schou Andreassen, and Pallesen 2014).\nAs surveillance capitalism spread across the Internet, the means of social \nparticipation became coextensive with the means of behavioral modifica -\ntion, eroding the choice mechanisms that adhere to the private realm —\nexit, voice, and loyalty. There can be no exit from processes that we cannot \ndetect and upon which we must depend for the effectiveness of daily life. \nThis is a portion of the eBook at doi:10.7551/mitpress/11304.001.0001\nDownloaded from http://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-edited-volume/chapter-pdf/2259403/9780262353946_caa.pdf by guest on 14 January 2026\n\f\n24 Shoshana Zuboff\nUsers are not customers and thus far lack institutionalized means of col -\nlective action that would establish reliable channels for voice. Loyalty is \nan empty suit, as continued participation is better explained in terms of \nhelplessness, resignation, and the foreclosure of alternatives.\nNext I turn to the second key answer to the question “How do they get \naway with it?” That answer is power.\nThe Rise of Instrumentarian Power\nThe internal pressures exerted by surveillance capitalism’s economic imper-\natives produce the compulsion to “make them dance.” First, production is \nsubordinated to extraction, and then the means of production is subordi -\nnated to the means of behavioral modification. Finally, what is produced is \nthe guarantee of outcomes, or at least the ever- improving approximation \nto such guarantees. These guarantees have value, but in the novel logic of \nsurveillance capitalism, their value is a function of markets that bear no \norganic reciprocities with their populations, now repurposed as the source \nof unlimited raw material supplies. This analysis brings us to the edge of a \nnew terrain, but no further. I have suggested that there can be no guarantee \nof outcomes without the power to make it so. In order to proceed, it is nec-\nessary to answer the question, what is this new power to “make them dance”? \nThe answer offers a glimpse into the dark heart of surveillance capitalism as \na usurper of rights and a civilizational force.\nThe first key point is that there is no historical precedent for the quality \nof power that now confronts us. It is, I argue, an unprecedented species of \npower that emerges in the unprecedented digital milieu of surveillance cap-\nitalism and its unprecedented economic logic founded on the dispossession \nof human behavior as the new source of capital accumulation. Any encoun-\nter with the unprecedented is itself a genuine intellectual and existential \nchallenge, and this fact itself merits our attention. That which is unprece -\ndented is necessarily unrecognizable, tacitly interpreted through the lens of \nfamiliar categories. This mental operation renders invisible precisely those \ndimensions of experience for which there are no established mental sets. \nA classic example is the notion of the “horseless carriage” to which peo -\nple reverted when confronted with the unprecedented facts of the auto -\nmobile. Existing lenses illuminate the familiar and obscure the original by \nturning the unprecedented into an extension of the past. The sociology of \nThis is a portion of the eBook at doi:10.7551/mitpress/11304.001.0001\nDownloaded from http://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-edited-volume/chapter-pdf/2259403/9780262353946_caa.pdf by guest on 14 January 2026\n\f\n“We Make Them Dance” 25\nthe unprecedented multiplies this effect. Once the abnormal is normalized, \nhabituation and psychic numbing make contest even more unlikely (Baehr \n2002; Lifton 2010; Slovic et al. 2011; van Der Kolk and Saporta 1991).\nIn the years during and immediately following World War II, scholars \nconfronted these barriers of cognition, imagination, and language as they \ntried to name and grasp another unprecedented configuration of power, \nwhat would come to be known as “totalitarianism.” In the early phases of \nthis effort, critics appropriated the horseless- carriage language of “imperial-\nism” as the only framework at hand with which to articulate and resist the \nnew power’s murderous threats. With a few important exceptions, it was \nonly after the Nazi defeat that the program of naming began in earnest.\nThat confrontation with the unprecedented is reflected in the mov -\ning accounts of the first scholars determined to lift the veil on their era’s \ngruesome truths. The systematic accretion of violence and complicity that \nengulfed whole populations at extreme velocity invoked a kind of bewil -\nderment that ended in paralysis, even for many of the greatest minds of the \ntwentieth century. Harvard political scientist Carl Friedrich was among the \nfirst scholars of totalitarianism to address this experience of improbability \nwriting in 1954: “Virtually no one before 1914 anticipated the course of \ndevelopment which has overtaken Western civilization since then . . . none \nof the outstanding scholars in history, law, and the social sciences discerned \nwhat was ahead . . . which culminated in totalitarianism. To this failure to \nforesee corresponds a difficulty in comprehending” (Friedrich 1954, 1– 2).\nNearly every intellectual who turned to this project in the period imme-\ndiately following the war cites the feeling of astonishment at the suddenness \nwith which, as Friedrich put it, totalitarianism had “burst upon mankind . . . \nunexpected and unannounced” (Friedrich 1954, 1). Its manifestations were \nso novel and unanticipated, so shocking, rapid, and unparalleled, that all \nof it eluded language, challenging every tradition, norm, value, and legiti -\nmate form of action. Hannah Arendt described the defeat of Nazi Germany \nas “the first chance to try to tell and to understand what had happened . . . \nstill in grief and sorrow and . . . a tendency to lament, but no longer in \nspeechless outrage and impotent horror” (Arendt 2004, 387). Later, histo -\nrian Robert Conquest would document the similar failure of journalists, \nscholars, and Western governments in reckoning the full weight of Soviet \ntotalitarianism’s monstrous achievements. The most salient reason for this \nfailure, he observed, was that the actual facts were so “improbable” that it \nThis is a portion of the eBook at doi:10.7551/mitpress/11304.001.0001\nDownloaded from http://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-edited-volume/chapter-pdf/2259403/9780262353946_caa.pdf by guest on 14 January 2026\n\f\n26 Shoshana Zuboff\nwas difficult even for specialists to grasp their truth. “Plenty of information \nwas available contradicting the official picture,” wrote Conquest. “The Sta-\nlin epoch is replete with what appear as improbabilities to minds unfitted \nto deal with the phenomena” (Conquest 2008, 486).\nUltimately, a courageous body of scholarship would evolve to meet the \nchallenge of comprehension. It yielded different models and schools of \nthought, each with distinct emphasis and insights, but these shared com -\nmon purpose in the work of naming. “Totalitarianism has discovered a \nmeans of dominating and terrorizing human beings from within,” wrote \nArendt, the German- born philosopher who would spend the six years after \nWorld War II writing her extraordinary study of totalitarian power, pub -\nlished in 1951 as The Origins of Totalitarianism (Arendt 2004, 431). Arendt’s \nwas a detailed disclosure and a pioneering attempt to theorize what had \njust occurred. “Comprehension,” she said, is the necessary response to the \n“truly radical nature of Evil” disclosed by totalitarianism. “It means  .  .  . \nexamining and bearing consciously the burden which our century has \nplaced on us— neither denying its existence nor submitting meekly to its \nweight.” Totalitarianism was bent on the “destruction of humanity” and \n“the essence of man,” but, she insisted, “to turn our backs on the destruc-\ntive forces of the century is of little avail” (Arendt 2004, xxvii). Essential \nhere was the deletion of all ties and sources of meaning other than “the \nmovement”: “Total loyalty— the psychological basis for domination— can \nbe expected only from the completely isolated human being who, without \nany other social ties to family, friends, comrades, or even mere acquain -\ntances, derives his sense of having a place in the world only from his belong-\ning to a movement, his membership in the party” (Arendt 2004, 429).\nMidcentury scholars such as Friedrich, Adorno, Gurian, Brzezinski, and \nAron added to these themes, recognizing totalitarianism’s insistence on \ndomination of the human soul (Adorno 1966, 1985, 1991; Aron 1968; Frie-\ndrich 1954, 1956 ). The Russian- born political scientist Waldemar Gurian, \nwho escaped Nazi Germany in 1939, argued that totalitarianism functioned \nas a “secularized political religion” that requires “absolute obedience” and \ndemands “active acclamation” (Gurian 1954, 119– 129). Political scientists \nCarl Friedrich and Zbigniew Brzezinski emphasized totalitarianism’s reli -\nance on terror to drive and sustain “human remolding,” “re- educative mea-\nsures,” and “extensive revisions” of self and psyche (Friedrich and Brzezinski \n1956, 130– 133).

Neumann described the Third Reich’s subordina-\ntion of the means of production to the “means of violence,” as the Nazis \nasserted authority over property and production, both through the expro -\npriation of Jewish assets and through the party’s command and control of \nkey industries (Neumann and Hayes 2009, 470– 76, 632– 634).\nTotalitarianism was bent on the purification of the human species \nthrough the dual mechanisms of genocide and the “engineering of the \nsoul.” In this way totalitarian regimes could achieve their fantastical aim \nof “the People- as- one,” as Claude Lefort describes it. “Social unanimity cor-\nresponds to inner unanimity, held in place by hatred activated toward the \n‘enemies of the people’” (Lefort 1986, 297– 298). But to command popula-\ntions right down to their souls requires unimaginable effort, which was one \nreason why totalitarianism was unimaginable. It measures success at the cel-\nlular level, penetrating to the quick, where it subverts and commands each \nunspoken yearning in pursuit of the genocidal vision that historian Richard \nShorten calls “the experiment in reshaping humanity” (Shorten 2012, 50). \nEach individual inner life must be claimed and transformed by the per -\npetual threat of terror: punishment without crime. This craftwork requires \nthe detailed orchestration of isolation, anxiety, fear, persuasion, fantasy, \nlonging, inspiration, torture, dread, and surveillance. Arendt describes the \nrelentless process of “atomization” and fusion in which terror destroys the \nordinary human bonds of law, norms, trust, and affection, “which provide \nthe living space for the freedom of the individual” (Arendt 1994, 343).\nArendt’s project of naming was embedded in a larger wave of postwar \nreform determined to inoculate civilization from the genocidal impulse \nand institutionalized in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights \n(UDHR), beginning with the assertion, “All human beings are born free and \nequal in dignity and rights.” As Michael Ignatieff has argued, the UDHR \nfounded a “judicial revolution,” establishing a global juridical framework \nof human rights that both ignited and legitimated the justice demands of \ncolonial subjects, civil rights groups, and other movements originating in \nexclusion and oppression (Ignatieff 2001; see also Franck 2000).\nNow a new surveillance- based economic order casts us adrift in a dif -\nferent dark sea of original and thus difficult- to- discern dangers, where \nthe abrogation of human rights does not always or easily correspond to \nthe historical development of human rights and its established juridical \nThis is a portion of the eBook at doi:10.7551/mitpress/11304.001.0001\nDownloaded from http://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-edited-volume/chapter-pdf/2259403/9780262353946_caa.pdf by guest on 14 January 2026\n\f\n28 Shoshana Zuboff\nframeworks. And just as the scholars of totalitarianism once looked to \nnineteenth- century imperialism to explain the violence of their time, it is \nwe who now reach for the familiar vernaculars of twentieth- century power \nlike lifesaving driftwood. Invariably we look to the specter of totalitarian -\nism as the lens through which to interpret today’s threats. The result is \nthat Google, Facebook, and the larger field of commercial surveillance are \nfrequently criticized as “Big Brother” or “digital totalitarianism” (Blakely \n2014; Borowicz 2014; Doctorow 2017; Economist 2004; Hirsh 2015; Menell \n2013; Schulz 2016; Sorell and Draper 2012). I admire those who have stood \nagainst the incursions of commercial surveillance, but I also suggest that \nthe equation of its new power with totalitarianism and the Orwellian trope \nimpedes our understanding as well as our ability to resist, neutralize, and \nultimately vanquish its potency. Instead, we need to grasp the specific inner \nlogic of a conspicuously twenty- first- century conjuring of power to which \nthe past offers no adequate compass. Its aims are in many ways just as ambi-\ntious as those of totalitarianism, but they are also utterly and profoundly \ndistinct. The work of naming a strange form of power unprecedented in the \nhuman experience must begin anew for the sake of effective resistance and \nthe creative power to insist on a future of our own making.\nAs to the new species of power, I have suggested that it is best understood \nas instrumentarianism, defined as the instrumentation and instrumentalization \nof behavior for the purposes of modification, prediction, monetization and control. \nIn this formulation, “instrumentation” refers to the ubiquitous, sensate, \ncomputational, actuating global architecture that renders, monitors, com -\nputes, and modifies human behavior. Surveillance capitalism is the puppet \nmaster that imposes its will through the vast capabilities of this connected \npuppet to produce instrumentarian power, replacing the engineering of \nsouls with the engineering of behavior. There is no brother here of any \nkind, big or little, evil or good— no family ties, however grim. Instead, this \nnew global apparatus is better understood as a Big Other that encodes the \nviewpoint of the Other- One as a pervasive presence, finally bringing Skin -\nner’s longed for “technology of behavior” to life. “Instrumentalization” \ndenotes the social relations that orient the puppet masters to human expe-\nrience, as surveillance capital overrides long- standing reciprocities of mar-\nket democracy, wielding its machines to transform us into the means to \nothers’ market ends. Although he did not name it, Mark Weiser, the vision-\nary of ubiquitous computing, foresaw the immensity of instrumentarian \nThis is a portion of the eBook at doi:10.7551/mitpress/11304.001.0001\nDownloaded from http://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-edited-volume/chapter-pdf/2259403/9780262353946_caa.pdf by guest on 14 January 2026\n\f\n“We Make Them Dance” 29\npower as a totalizing societal project. He did so in a way that suggests both \nits utter lack of precedent and the danger of confounding it with what \nhas gone before: “Hundreds of computers in every room, all capable of \nsensing people near them and linked by high- speed networks, have the \npotential to make totalitarianism up to now seem like sheerest anarchy” \n(Weiser 1999, 89). In fact, all those computers are not the means to a digital \nhypertotalitarianism. They are, as I think Weiser sensed, the foundation of \nan unprecedented power that can reshape society in unprecedented ways. \nIf instrumentarian power can make totalitarianism look like anarchy, then \nwhat might it have in store for us?\nWhile all power yearns toward totality, instrumentarian power’s specific \npurposes and methods are not only distinct from totalitarianism but they \nare in many ways its precise opposite. Surveillance capitalists have no interest \nin murder or the reformation of our souls. Instrumentarian power, there -\nfore, has no principle to instruct. There is no training or transformation for \nspiritual salvation, no ideology against which to judge our actions. It does \nnot demand possession of each person from the inside out. It has no inter-\nest in exterminating or disfiguring our bodies and minds in the name of \npure devotion. Totalitarianism was a political project that converged with \neconomics to overwhelm society. Instrumentarianism is a market project \nthat converges with the digital to achieve its own unique brand of social \ndomination. Totalitarianism operated through the means of violence, but \ninstrumentarian power operates through the means of behavioral modifica-\ntion. And this is where our focus must shift. What passes for social relations \nand economic exchange now occurs across the medium of this robotized \nveil of abstraction.\nInstrumentarianism’s specific “viewpoint of observation” was forged in \nthe controversial intellectual domain of “radical behaviorism.” Thanks to \nBig Other’s capabilities, instrumentarian power reduces human experience \nto measurable, observable behavior, while remaining steadfastly indiffer -\nent to the meaning of that experience. It is profoundly, infinitely, and, \nfollowing its behaviorist origins, radically indifferent to our meanings and \nmotives. This epistemology of radical indifference produces observation with-\nout witness. Instead of an intimate violent political religion, Big Other’s way \nof knowing us yields the remote but inescapable presence of impenetrably \ncomplex systems and the interests that author them, carrying individuals \non a fast- moving current to the fulfillment of others’ ends.

It has no appetite for our grief, \npain, or terror, although it welcomes the behavioral surplus that leaches \nfrom our anguish.\nTrained on measurable action, Big Other cares only about observing \nwhat we do and ensuring that we do it in ways that are accessible to its ever- \nevolving operations of rendition, reinforcement, calculation, and moneti -\nzation. Instrumentarianism’s radical indifference is operationalized in Big \nOther’s dehumanized methods of evaluation that produce equivalence with-\nout equality by reducing individuals to the lowest common denominator of \nsameness— an organism among organisms.\nIn the execution of economies of action, Big Other simulates the behav-\niorists’ “vortex of stimuli,” transforming “natural selection” into the \n“unnatural selection” of variation and reinforcement authored by market \nplayers and the competition for surveillance revenues. We may confuse Big \nOther with the behaviorist god of the vortex, but only because it effectively \nconceals the machinations of surveillance capitalism that are the wizard \nbehind the digital curtain. The gentle seductive voice crafted on the yonder \nside of this veil— Google, is that you? — gently herds us along the path that \ncoughs up the maximum of behavioral surplus and the closest approxima-\ntion to certainty.\nInstrumentarian Power Thrives in Lawless Space\nInstrumentarianism is not murderous, but it is as startling, incomprehensi-\nble, and new to the human story as totalitarianism was to its witnesses and \nvictims. Thanks to Big Other’s capabilities to know and to do, instrumen -\ntarian power aims for a condition of certainty without terror in the form of \n“guaranteed outcomes.” In pursuit of this certainty, the locus of economic \npower shifts from ownership of the means of production to ownership of \nthe means of behavioral modification. Instrumentarian power produces \nendlessly accruing knowledge and control for surveillance capitalists and \ndiminished self- determination for its populations who now fund their own \ndomination as targets of extraction and modification.\nThe paradox is that because instrumentarianism does not claim our bod-\nies for some grotesque regime of pain and murder, we are prone to under -\nvalue its effects and lower our guard.

It severs our insides from our outsides, our subjectivity and inte-\nriority from our observable actions. Otherized behavior takes on a life of its \nown that delivers our actions now, soon, and later to surveillance capital -\nism’s aims and interests.\nUnder the regime of instrumentarian power, the mental agency and self- \npossession of autonomous human action are gradually submerged beneath a \nnew kind of automaticity: a lived routine of stimulus– response– reinforcement \nthat operates outside of awareness and is aggregated as statistical phenom-\nena: the comings and goings of mere organisms. Our conformity is irrele -\nvant to instrumentarianism’s success. There is no need for mass submission \nto social norms, no loss of self to the collective induced by terror and com-\npulsion, no inducements of acceptance and belonging as a reward for bend-\ning to the group. All of that is superseded by a market- based digital order \nthat thrives within things and bodies, transforming volition into reinforce-\nment and action into conditioned response.\nUsing Polanyi’s lens, we have seen that surveillance capitalism annexes \nhuman experience to the market dynamic so that it is reborn as behav -\nior: the fourth “fictional commodity.” However, Polanyi’s first three fic -\ntional commodities— land, labor, and money— were eventually subjected \nto law. Although these laws have been imperfect, the institutions of labor \nlaw, environmental law, and banking law provided regulatory frameworks \nintended to defend society (and nature, life, and exchange) from the worst \nexcesses of raw capitalism’s destructive power. Surveillance capitalism’s \ntranslation of human experience into market commodities has thus far \nfaced no such impediments.\nIn earlier work I detail the historical conditions and forms of corporate \naction that enabled surveillance capitalism’s successful pursuit and suste -\nnance of lawless space (Zuboff 2019). While a reprise of those arguments \nexceeds the space of this chapter, two conditions float above them all, and \nthey merit emphasis. The first reverts to the sociology of the unprecedented, \nas the original action of instrumentarian power works its will before it can \nbe adequately understood, thus enjoying a substantial lag in social evolu -\ntion and the eventual production of law. This problem is already evident \nin the commoditization of human experience, which does not easily corre-\nspond to established legal frameworks, such as those that concern privacy \nrights or anticompetitive corporate practices.

In this respect surveillance capitalists have enjoyed \na political windfall, not unlike the Gilded Age titans who exploited the \nabsence of industry regulation in their time to claim undefended territory \nfor their own interests, declare the righteousness of their self- authorizing \nprerogatives, and defend their brand of raw capitalism from democracy \n(Nasaw 2005). Imbued with the conviction that “the state had neither right \nnor reason to interfere in the workings of the economy,” Gilded Age mil -\nlionaires joined forces to defend the “rights of capital” and limit the role \nof elected representatives in setting policy or developing legislation (Nasaw \n2005, 124– 125). There was no need for law, they argued, when one had the \n“law of evolution,” the “laws of capital,” and the “laws of industrial soci -\nety.” John Rockefeller insisted that his outsized oil fortune was the result \nof “the natural law of trade development.” Jay Gould, when questioned by \nCongress on the need for federal regulation of railroad rates, replied that \n“the laws of supply and demand, production and consumption” already \nregulate rates (Nasaw 2005, 132).\nGilded Age business elites determined that the most effective way to \nprotect the original sin of that economic era was, as historian David Nasaw \nputs it, “to circumscribe democracy.” They did this by lavishly funding their \nown political candidates as well as through the careful honing and aggres-\nsive dissemination of an ideological attack on the very notion of democra-\ncy’s right to interfere in the economic realm (Friedman 2004, 14– 28; Nasaw \n2005, 146, 148).\nA similar determination to conduct surveillance capitalism free of demo-\ncratic oversight dominates Google’s short but remarkable history. Its ability \nto discern, construct, and stake its claim to the unregulated territories of the \nInternet not yet subject to law and, in the United States at least, free from \nconstitutional constraints, was essential to its frictionless accumulation of \nsurplus as the means to its frictionless accumulation of power and capital. \nThis is a portion of the eBook at doi:10.7551/mitpress/11304.001.0001\nDownloaded from http://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-edited-volume/chapter-pdf/2259403/9780262353946_caa.pdf by guest on 14 January 2026\n\f\n“We Make Them Dance” 33\nEric Schmidt and Jared Cohen celebrate their claim to operational spaces \nbeyond the reach of political institutions on the very first page of their \nbook on the digital age: “The online world is not truly bound by terrestrial \nlaws . . . it’s the world’s largest ungoverned space” (Schmidt and Cohen \n2014).\nSurveillance capitalists are impelled to pursue lawlessness by the logic \nof their own creation. Google and Facebook vigorously lobby to kill online \nprivacy protection, limit regulations, weaken or block privacy- enhancing \nlegislation, and thwart every attempt to circumscribe their practices \nbecause such laws threaten the flow of behavioral surplus (Dougherty 2016; \nGoogle Transparency Project 2016, 2017; Mullins and Nicas 2017; Shaban \n2017a, 2017b; Statista 2017; Taplin 2017). Schmidt, Brin, and Page have \nardently defended their right to freedom from law even as Google grew to \nbecome what is arguably the world’s most powerful corporation (Khosla \n2004). Their efforts have been marked by a few consistent themes: that \ntechnology companies such as Google move faster than the state’s ability \nto understand or follow; that any attempts to intervene or constrain are \ntherefore fated to be ill- conceived and inept; that regulation is always a \nnegative force that impedes innovation and progress; and that lawlessness \nis the necessary context for innovation (Cunningham 2011; Gobry 2011; \nJenkins 2010; Yarow 2013).\nMany hopes today are pinned on the new body of EU regulation known \nas the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which became enforce-\nable in May 2018. In time the world will learn if the GDPR can move out \nin front of Big Other, successfully challenging the legitimacy of surveil -\nlance capitalism, its means of behavioral modification, and its production \nof instrumentarian power. Scholars and specialists debate the implications \nof the sweeping new regulations, some arguing the inevitability of deci -\nsive change, and others arguing the likelihood of continuity over dramatic \nreversals of practice (Keller 2017; Mayer- Schönberger and Padova 2016; \nRossi 2016; Wachter 2017; Zarsky 2017). The only possible answer is that \neverything will depend upon how European societies interpret the new \nregulatory regime in legislation and in the courts. It will not be the word -\ning of the regulations but rather popular movements on the ground that \nshape these interpretations.

Instrumentarianism opens \nthese borderlands to profit seeking, as market operations fill the void where \ndemocratic institutions should be. It is already clear that instrumentar -\nian power produces specific contests over the constitutionally established \nrights of citizens. For example, when US scholars and jurists assess the ways \nin which digital capabilities challenge Fourth Amendment doctrine, the \nfocus is typically on the relationship between individuals and the state. It \nis of course vital that Fourth Amendment protections reflect the realities of \ntwenty- first- century data production and dispossession (Brennan- Marquez \nand Henderson 2017; Gray 2017a, 2017b; Kerr 2005, 531– 585; Wydra et \nal. 2017). The problem is that even expanded protections from state sur -\nveillance do not shield users from the assaults of instrumentarian power \nanimated by surveillance capitalism’s private economic imperatives (Daskal \n2015; Kerr 2005).\nLegal scholarship is just beginning to reckon with these new facts. Fourth \nAmendment scholar Andrew Guthrie Ferguson concludes, “If billions of \nsensors filled with personal data fall outside of Fourth Amendment protec-\ntions, a large- scale surveillance network will exist without constitutional \nlimits” (Ferguson 2015, 879– 880). Dutch scholars make a similar case for \nthe inadequacy of Dutch law as it trails behind Big Other, no longer able to \neffectively assert the sanctity of the home from the invasive action of either \nindustry or the state. “The walls no longer shield the individual effectively \nfrom the outside in the pursuing of . . . personal life without intrusion . . .” \n(Van Dongen and Timan 2017).\nThese and other contests over the extension of juridical rights to surveil-\nlance capitalism’s market domain point us toward an even deeper crisis of \nhuman rights, delivering us head- on to Hannah Arendt’s meta- formulation \nof the “right to have rights.” Arendt’s assertion peels away juridical achieve-\nments—she refers to these as the “Rights of Man” —revealing the a priori \ngrounds upon which the very possibility of juridical rights rests. It is here \non the ground of what I shall refer to as “elemental human rights” that \nThis is a portion of the eBook at doi:10.7551/mitpress/11304.001.0001\nDownloaded from http://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-edited-volume/chapter-pdf/2259403/9780262353946_caa.pdf by guest on 14 January 2026\n\f\n“We Make Them Dance” 35\nI propose to consider the implications of surveillance capitalism and its \ninstrumentarian power for the prospects of human freedom.4\nInstrumentarian Power as a Coup from Above\nFor Arendt, the “right to have rights” stands in contrast to juridical rights \nas indelible, “Man, it turns out, can lose all so- called Rights of Man with -\nout losing his essential quality as man, his human dignity” (Arendt 2004, \n377). This is because the “right to have rights” equates to the “right of \nevery individual to belong to humanity,” and it “should be guaranteed by \nhumanity itself” (Arendt 2004, 379). What does this belonging signify? For \nArendt it means, above all, the possibility of effective life through voice and \naction, possibilities that are given in the elemental condition of inclusion \nin the human community. To belong to humanity is to belong to a world \nin which one can choose one’s actions and exercise one’s voice in ways that \neffectively further the aims of one’s own life and the life of one’s group.\nHow does the elemental condition of belonging to humanity translate \ninto a “right to have rights”? Arendt argues that this conversion from ele -\nmental condition to explicit right arises only in the confrontation with a \nthreat to the condition of inclusion:\nWe became aware of the existence of a “right to have rights” (and that means \nto live in a framework where one is judged by one’s actions and opinions) and \na right to belong to some kind of organized community, only when millions of \npeople emerged who had lost and could not regain these rights because of the \nnew global political situation. . . . Not the loss of specific rights, then, but the loss \nof a community willing and able to guarantee any rights whatsoever, has been the \ncalamity which has befallen ever- increasing numbers of people. Only the loss of a \npolity itself expels him from humanity. (Arendt 2004, 376– 377)\nOnly exclusion from humanity itself, and thus exclusion from the elemen-\ntal freedoms of voice and action, can abrogate the “right to have rights.” \n“The fundamental deprivation of human rights is manifested first and \nabove all in the deprivation of a place in the world which makes opinions \nsignificant and actions effective” (Arendt 2004, 376).\nIn this Arendt foreshadows the linguistic philosopher John Searle’s \n“pragmatic considerations of the formulation of rights” (Searle 2010, \n194– 195). Searle argues that elemental conditions of existence are crystal -\nlized as formal human rights only at that moment in history when they \nThis is a portion of the eBook at doi:10.7551/mitpress/11304.001.0001\nDownloaded from http://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-edited-volume/chapter-pdf/2259403/9780262353946_caa.pdf by guest on 14 January 2026\n\f\n36 Shoshana Zuboff\ncome under systematic threat. So, for example, the ability to speak is an ele-\nmental condition. The concept of “freedom of speech” as a formal juridical \nright emerged only when society evolved to a degree of political complexity \nthat the freedom to speak came under threat. Searle observes that speech is \nnot more central to human life than breathing or being able to move one’s \nbody. No one has declared a “right to breathe” or a “right to bodily move-\nment” because these elemental conditions have not come under attack and \ntherefore do not require formal protection. What counts as a basic right, \nSearle argues, is both “historically contingent” and “pragmatic” (Searle \n2010, 194– 195).\nIt is not surprising then, that Arendt wrestled with the elemental human \nconditions of inclusion, voice, and action at a time when totalitarianism \nforced many philosophers and social theorists to question the structure of \nhuman freedom (Adorno 2008; Arendt 1983; Sartre 1957, 1992). Were there \nelemental constituents of human freedom that remain ineradicable, even \nin the teeth of “no escape” from a totalizing power? For the Arendt of Ori-\ngins “action” was an indelible manifestation of freedom. Of those deprived \nof human rights under totalitarianism she wrote, “They are deprived, not of \nthe right to freedom, but of the right to action” (Arendt 2004, 376).\nIt was a theme that she would elaborate throughout her life: action \ninitiates. It asserts beginnings that diverge from established lines of force. \nAction inserts itself into the already composed human world to make \nsomething new. “To act . . . means to take an initiative, to begin . . . to \nset something into motion” (Arendt 1998, 176– 177). Arendt observes that \nevery beginning, seen from the perspective of the framework that it inter -\nrupts, is a miracle. The capacity for performing such miracles is uniquely \nhuman. “What usually remains intact in the epochs of petrification and \nforeordained doom is the faculty of freedom itself, the sheer capacity to \nbegin, which animates and inspires all human activities and is the hidden \nsource . . . of all great and beautiful things” (Arendt 1993, 169).\nKey to our discussion is Arendt’s insistence that “this insertion is not \nforced upon us by necessity. . . . It may be stimulated by the presence of \nothers whose company we may wish to join, but it is never conditioned by \nthem; its impulse springs from the beginning which came into the world \nwhen we were born and to which we respond by beginning something new \non our own initiative” (Arendt 1993, 177). She explores this “impulse” in \nher extensive examination of “will,” which she characterizes as the “organ \nThis is a portion of the eBook at doi:10.7551/mitpress/11304.001.0001\nDownloaded from http://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-edited-volume/chapter-pdf/2259403/9780262353946_caa.pdf by guest on 14 January 2026\n\f\n“We Make Them Dance” 37\nfor the future” in the same way that memory is the mental organ for the \npast. When we recall the past, we see only objects, but the view to the \nfuture brings “projects” that are latent in our will but have not yet come \nto be. Will is the organ with which we summon our futures into existence \nas we project ourselves into the future tense, make promises, and close the \ngap between present and future by fulfilling those promises as we translate \nthe latent into the real.\nThese initiatives could have been “left undone” but for the inward free-\ndom to project our commitments into the future and impose our will to \nsee them through. It is not only that we make new beginnings, but also \nthat these beginnings would not come into existence in the absence of \nour willing to undertake them. In this way, the future remains contingent \non our will to create it and must therefore be understood as intrinsically \nunpredictable. Will is the human counterpoint to the fear of uncertainty \nthat suffocates original action: “A will that is not free is a contradiction in \nterms” (Arendt 1978, 13– 14).\nThese elemental manifestations of human self- determination, Arendt \nargues, derive from the capacity “to dispose of the future as though it were \nthe present.” Will is the means by which we annex the future tense, trans-\nforming it into a territory for deliberation, choice, promises, and the initia-\ntion of new beginnings in the fulfillment of those promises. This is how we \nmanage the inescapable uncertainty of existence and achieve, as individuals \nand as communities, some “limited independence from the incalculability \nof the future.” Arendt thus describes promises as “islands of predictability” \nand “guideposts of reliability” in an “ocean of uncertainty.” They are, she \nargues, the only alternative to a different kind of “mastery” that relies on \n“domination of one’s self and rule over others” when the lust for certainty \nproduces the impulse “to cover the whole ground of the future and to map \nout a path secured in all directions” (Arendt 1998, 243– 247). In this way \nhuman action as an elemental source of freedom expresses a dynamic biog-\nraphy born in the inwardness of will in order to flourish in the embrace of \na human community where wills are joined to produce effective life, prom-\nising and keeping promises in shared purpose.\nWe have seen that the “right to have rights” is crystallized only in the \nhistorical moment when inclusion in humanity comes under threat. But \nwhat of action’s birthplace in the elemental functions of human will and its \nannexation of the future? Arendt’s metaphor of will asserts the inalienable \nThis is a portion of the eBook at doi:10.7551/mitpress/11304.001.0001\nDownloaded from http://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-edited-volume/chapter-pdf/2259403/9780262353946_caa.pdf by guest on 14 January 2026\n\f\n38 Shoshana Zuboff\nstatus of this elemental inward capacity. What happens when the uniquely \nhuman capacity to dispose of the future as though it were the present—the \nright to count the future as one’s field of action —is threatened with sup -\npression or extinction? Following Arendt’s and Searle’s logic, such a threat \ndemands the translation of this elemental condition of human freedom \ninto a right, that it might be recognized as fundamental to effective life and \naccorded the protection of the political community.\nThis elemental condition in which we annex the future to the present \nas the field of autonomous action is what I have called the right to the future \ntense (Zuboff 2019). It asserts the inalienable capacity to will the future into \nexistence through the force of one’s own choice and commitment, and it \nrecognizes this capacity as a baseline condition of effective human life. In \nclaiming the future as a potential field of self- determined action, the right \nto the future tense asserts the unbroken biography of will and action that \nfounds Arendt’s “right to have rights.” The right to the future tense and \nthe “right to have rights” are twinborn. Expressed in action and guaran -\nteed by inclusion in the human group, the “right to have rights” already \npresupposes the future tense as the ground on which the inner organ of \nthe will is made manifest in the shared reality of the human community. \nEach is essential to the meaning and manifestation of the other, joined in \nthe biographical arc of birth and adulthood. If the right to the future tense \nis abrogated, the miracle of human action is subordinated to others’ plans \nthat favor others’ certainty. In the absence of the right to the future tense, \nthe “right to have rights” is shorn of its origins in will and drifts into mem-\nory, a token of earlier unpredictable times.\nI suggest that we now face the moment in history when the elemental \ncondition in which we claim the future for autonomous action is threatened \nby the laws of motion of a new economic order in which wealth derives \nfrom the predictability of human behavior. The competitive dynamics of \nthis new order require economies of action that operate to configure human \nbehavior in ways that facilitate predictability. These operations grow more \nmuscular with the escalation of competitive intensity, driving the evolu -\ntion of predictability toward certainty. They are made manifest in a ubiqui-\ntous digital architecture of behavior modification owned and operated by \nsurveillance capital outside of meaningful legal boundaries, indecipherable, \nand largely hidden. Motive and means combine to produce a new instru -\nmentarian power that supplants freedom as the crucible of human action \nThis is a portion of the eBook at doi:10.7551/mitpress/11304.001.0001\nDownloaded from http://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-edited-volume/chapter-pdf/2259403/9780262353946_caa.pdf by guest on 14 January 2026\n\f\n“We Make Them Dance” 39\nfor the sake of guaranteed outcomes and the competitive advantages that \nthey confer in markets that trade in the future of human behavior.\nInstrumentarian power employs the logic of radical behaviorism to exile \npersons from their own behavior, reducing action to measurable behav -\nior and severing interior meaning from observable performance. In this \nprocess, the human person is reduced to an organism among organisms. \nThis constitutes a bloodless methodology through which not only are per-\nsons excluded from humanity but, for the sake of others’ market success, \nhumanity itself is excluded from the calculative knowledge that shapes the \nfuture. These new information territories are private and privileged, known \nonly to the machines, their priests, and the market participants who pay \nto play in these new market spaces. Although it is obviously the case that \nwe are excluded because the knowledge thus accumulated is not for us, the \ndemands of economies of action suggest an even deeper structural basis for \nexclusion: the ability to evade individual awareness, and therefore individual \nwill, is an essential condition for the efficient exercise of instrumentarian power \nand its economic objectives. Autonomous human action is costly friction that \nthreatens surveillance revenues. In this way a new form of domination and \nits maps of a certain future override the right to the future tense.\nInstrumentarian power does not simply destroy elemental rights; it \nusurps them. Such processes of expropriation were first evident in the trans-\nfer of decision rights over personal information from individuals to surveil-\nlance capitalists. The competitive demand for economies of action and the \nelaboration of the means of behavioral modification extends the pattern of \nexpropriation to the elemental right to the future tense, which is the right \nto count the future as one’s field of action, to initiate beginnings, and thus, \nto borrow from Machado, to make the road as you go (Machado 2003).\nFor this reason surveillance capitalism and its instrumentarian power are \nbest described as a market- driven coup from above— not a coup d’état in the \nclassic sense but rather a coup de gens: an overthrow of the people concealed \nin the technological Trojan horse that is Big Other. Instead of unpredictable \nhuman actors, the organism among organisms is manipulated for the sake \nof others’ certainty at the expense of the arc of autonomous action that \nbegins with the inner organ of free will and is completed in the mutual \nelaboration of a human community that guarantees the right to manifest \none’s will in action. Instrumentarian power is the hammer that suppresses \nhuman freedom in favor of others’ market certainty. First to be extinguished \nThis is a portion of the eBook at doi:10.7551/mitpress/11304.001.0001\nDownloaded from http://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-edited-volume/chapter-pdf/2259403/9780262353946_caa.pdf by guest on 14 January 2026\n\f\n40 Shoshana Zuboff\nin this coup is the pure impulse to initiate action that constructs social life \nas a miracle of unpredictable beginnings and distinguishes human beings \nas those who are born to replicate the natal miracle in original action. \nArendt anticipated the possibility of this threat to human freedom at the \nhands of a behaviorist project elevated by global capital to world- historic \npower. She feared that the “last stage of the laboring society” would reduce \nits members to “automatic functioning,” forced to acquiesce “in a dazed, \n‘tranquilized,’ functional type of behavior”:\nThe trouble with modern theories of behaviorism is not that they are wrong but \nthat they could become true, that they actually are the best possible conceptual-\nization of certain obvious trends in modern society. It is quite conceivable that \nthe modern age— which began with such an unprecedented and promising out -\nburst of human activity— may end in the deadliest, most sterile passivity history \nhas ever known. (Arendt 1998, 322)\nNow it is the surveillance capitalists who enjoy the right to the future tense \nand who claim the “right to have rights” over the fields of action and knowl-\nedge. Instrumentarian power accomplishes the dispossession of human \nexperience as an economic imperative, decisively prosecuting the redistri -\nbution of elemental human rights from individuals to capital. Surveillance \ncapitalism’s economic imperatives cannot be satisfied without these incur-\nsions into social and political territories that extend far beyond the tradi -\ntional boundaries of private capital. In this way surveillance capitalism and \nits instrumentarian power are revealed as a profoundly antidemocratic con-\nstellation. They do not simply evade democratic oversight, but rather they \nundermine the foundations of such oversight for the sake of guaranteed \noutcomes. Surveillance capitalists accumulate not only surveillance assets \nand capital but also the elemental right to action, which is to say, freedom.\nJust as industrial civilization flourished at the expense of nature and \nnow threatens to cost us the earth, surveillance capitalism and its unprece-\ndented instrumentarian power will thrive at the expense of human nature \nand threaten to cost us our humanity. The industrial legacy of climate \nchaos fills us with dismay, remorse, and fear. As surveillance capitalism \nfounds a new economic order, what fresh legacy of damage and regret will \nbe mourned by future generations? By the time you read these words, the \nreach of this new order will have grown, as more sectors, firms, start- ups, \napp developers, and investors mobilize around this one plausible version of \ninformation capitalism.

For readers who seek more detail, surveillance capitalism, its production of \ninstrumentarian power, and many of its rights implications are fully analyzed in The \nAge of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power \n(Zuboff 2019).\n2. A typical example is this statement from the Economist: “Google exploits informa-\ntion that is a by- product of user interactions, or data exhaust, which is automatically \nrecycled to improve the service or create an entirely new product.” “Clicking for \nGold,” Economist, February 25, 2010, http://www.economist.com/node/15557431.\n3. Between 2012 and 2015 I interviewed fifty- two data scientists from nineteen \ndifferent companies with a combined 586 years of experience in high technology \ncorporations and start- ups, primarily in Silicon Valley. These interviews were con -\nducted as I developed my “ground truth” understanding of surveillance capitalism \nand its material infrastructure.\n4. I mean to introduce here a distinction between “elemental” and “fundamental” \nhuman rights. For example, “equality under the law” is a fundamental right. In \ncontrast, “breathing” or “moving one’s arms” are elemental rights. Such rights are \ngiven under the condition of being alive and are rarely formalized as fundamental or \njuridical rights unless they come under direct threat of prohibition.\nReferences\nAddonizio, Gabrielle. 2016. “The Privacy Risks Surrounding Consumer Health and \nFitness Apps with HIPAA’s Limitations and the FTC’s Guidance.” Health Law Outlook \n9 (1). http://scholarship.shu.edu/health-law-outlook/vol9/iss1/1.\nAdorno, Theodor. 1966. “Education after Auschwitz,” in Critical Models: Interventions \nand Catchwords.
