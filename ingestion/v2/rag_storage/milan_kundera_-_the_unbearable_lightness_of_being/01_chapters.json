    "raw_text": "\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 2\nPART ONE \nLightness and Weight \nThe idea of eternal return is a mysterious one, and Nietzsche has often perplexed other \nphilosophers with it: to think that everything recurs as we  once experienced it, and that \nthe recurrence itself recurs ad infinitum! What does this mad myth signify? \nPutting it negatively, the myth of eternal return states that  a life which disappears once \nand for all, which does not return, is li ke a shadow, without we ight, dead in advance, \nand whether it was horrible, beautiful, or sublime, its horror, sublimity, and beauty mean \nnothing. We need take no more  note of it than of a war between two African kingdoms \nin the fourteenth century, a war that altered nothing in the destiny of the world, even if a \nhundred thousand blacks perished in excruciating torment. \nWill the war between two African kingdoms in the fourteenth century itself be altered if it \nrecurs again and again, in eternal return? \nIt will: it will become a solid mass, permanently protuberant, its inanity irreparable. \nIf the French Revolution were to recur eternally, French hi storians would be less proud \nof Robespierre. But because they deal with something that will not return, the bloody \nyears of the Revolution have turned into me re words, theories, and discussions, have \nbecome lighter than feathers, frightening no one. There is an infinite difference between \na Robespierre who occurs only once in history and a Robespierre who eternally returns, \nchopping off French heads. \nLet us therefore agree that t he idea of eternal return implies a perspective from which \nthings appear other than as we know them: they appear without the mitigating \ncircumstance of their transitor y nature. This mitigating circ umstance prevents us from \ncoming to a verdict. For how can we condemn something that is ephem eral, in transit? \nIn the sunset of dissolution, everything is illuminated by the aura of  nostalgia, even the \nguillotine. \nNot long ago, I caught myself experiencing a most incredible sensation. Leafing through \na book on Hitler, I was touched by some of his portraits: they reminded me of my \nchildhood. I grew up during the war; several members of my family perished in Hitler's \nconcentration camps; but what were their deat hs compared with the memories of a lost \nperiod in my life, a period that would never return? \nThis reconciliation with Hitler reveals the pr ofound moral perversity of a world that rests \nessentially on the nonexistence of return, fo r in this world everything is pardoned in \nadvance and therefore everything cynically permitted.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 3\nIf every second of our lives recurs an infinite number of times, we ar e nailed to eternity \nas Jesus Christ was nailed to the cross. It is a terrifying prospect. In the world of eternal \nreturn the weight of unbear able responsibility lies heavy on every move we make. That \nis why Nietzsche called the idea of eternal return t he heaviest of burdens (das \nschwerste Gewicht). \nIf eternal return is the heaviest of burdens, then our lives can stand out against it in all \ntheir splendid lightness. \nBut is heaviness truly deplorable and lightness splendid? \nThe heaviest of burdens crushes us, we sink beneath it, it pins us to the ground. But in \nthe love poetry of every age,  the woman longs to be wei ghed down by the man's body. \nThe heaviest of burdens is therefore simultaneously an image of life's most intense \nfulfillment. The heavier the burden, the closer our  lives come to the earth, the more real \nand truthful they become. \nConversely, the absolute absence of a burden causes man to be lighter than air, to soar \ninto the heights, take leav e of the earth and his earthly  being, and bec ome only half \nreal, his movements as free as they are insignificant. \nWhat then shall we choose? Weight or lightness? \nParmenides posed this very question in the sixth century before Christ. He saw the \nworld divided into pairs of opposites: \nlight/darkness, fineness/coarseness, warmt h/cold, being/non-being.  One half of the \nopposition he called positive ( light, fineness, warmth, being) , the other negative. We \nmight find this division into positive and nega tive poles childishly simple except for one \ndifficulty: which one is positive, weight or lightness? \nParmenides responded: lightness is positive, weight negativ e.Was he correct or not? \nThat is the question. The only certainty is: the lightness/weight o pposition is the most \nmysterious, most ambiguous of all. \nI have been thinking about Tomas for many years. But only in the light of these \nreflections did I see him clearly. I saw him standing at the window of his flat and looking \nacross the courtyard at the opposite walls, not knowing what to do. \nHe had first met Tereza about three weeks earlier in a small Czech town. They had \nspent scarcely an hour together. She had acco mpanied him to the station and waited \nwith him until he boarded the train. Ten days later she paid  him a visit. They made love \nthe day she arrived. That night she came down with a fever and stayed a whole week in \nhis flat with the flu. \nHe had come to feel an inexpl icable love for this all but complete stranger; she seemed \na child to him, a child someone had put in a bulrush ba sket daubed with pitch and sent \ndownstream for Tomas to fetch at the riverbank of his bed.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 4\nShe stayed with him a week, until she was well again, then went  back to her town, \nsome hundred and twenty-five miles from Pr ague. And then came the time I have just \nspoken of and see as the key to his life: Standing by the window, he looked out over the \ncourtyard at the walls opposite him and deliberated. \nShould he call her back to Prague for good? He  feared the responsibility. If he invited \nher to come, then come she would, and offer him up her life. \nOr should he refrain from approaching her? Then she would rema in a waitress in a \nhotel restaurant of a provincial town and he would never see her again. \nDid he want her to come or did he not? \nHe looked out over the courtyard at the opposite walls, seeking an answer. \nHe kept recalling her lying on his bed; she reminded him of no one in his former life. \nShe was neither mistress nor wife. She was a child whom he had taken from a bulrush \nbasket that had been daubed with pitc h and sent to the riverbank of his bed. She fell \nasleep. He knelt down next to her. Her feverous breath quickened and she gave out a \nweak moan. He pressed his face to hers a nd whispered calming words into her sleep. \nAfter a while he felt her breath return to normal and her face rise unconsciously to meet \nhis. He smelled the delicate aroma of her fever and breathed it in, as  if trying to glut \nhimself with the intimacy of her body. And a ll at once he fancied she had been with him \nfor many years and was dying. He had a sudden clear feeling that he would not survive \nher death. He would lie down be side her and want to die with her. He pressed his face \ninto the pillow beside her head and kept it there for a long time. \nNow he was standing at the window trying to call that moment to account. What could it \nhave been if not love declaring itself to him? \nBut was it love? The feeling of wanting to  die beside her was clearly exaggerated: he \nhad seen her only once before in  his life! Was it simply the hysteria of a man who, \naware deep down of his inaptitude for love, fe lt the self-deluding need to simulate it? \nHis unconscious was so cowardly that the best partner it could choose for its little \ncomedy was this miserable pr ovincial waitress with practica lly no chance at all to enter \nhis life! \nLooking out over the courtyard at the dirty walls, he realized he had no idea whether it \nwas hysteria or love. \nAnd he was distressed that in a situation w here a real man would instantly have known \nhow to act, he was vacillati ng and therefore depriv ing the most beautiful moments he \nhad ever experienced (kneeling at her bed and thinking he would not survive her death) \nof their meaning.  \nHe remained annoyed with himself until he realized that not kno wing what he wanted \nwas actually quite natural.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 5\nWe can never know what to want, because, living only one life, we can neither compare \nit with our previous lives nor perfect it in our lives to come. \nWas it better to be with Tereza or to remain alone? \nThere is no means of testing which decision is better, because there is no basis for \ncomparison. We live everything as it come s, without warning, like an actor going on \ncold. And what can life be worth if the first r ehearsal for life is life it self? That is why life \nis always like a sketch. No, sketch is not quite the word, because a sketch is an outline \nof something, the groundwork for a picture,  whereas the sketch that is our life is a \nsketch for nothing, an outline with no picture. \nEinmal ist keinmal,  says Tomas to himself. What happens but once, says the German \nadage, might as well not have happened at all. If we have only  one life to live,we might \nas well not have lived at all. \nBut then one day at the hospital, during a break between operations, a nurse called him \nto the telephone. He heard Tereza's voice coming from the receiver. She had phoned \nhim from the railway station. He was overjoyed. Unfortunately, he had something on \nthat evening and could not invite her to hi s place until the next day. The moment he \nhung up, he reproached himself for not telling her to go straight there. He had time \nenough to cancel his plans, after all! He tr ied to imagine what Tereza would do in \nPrague during the thirty-six long hours before they were to meet, and had half a mind to \njump into his car and drive through the streets looking for her. \nShe arrived the next evening, a handbag dangli ng from her shoulder, looking more \nelegant than before. She had a thick book under her arm. It was Anna Karenina. She \nseemed in a good mood, even a little boisterous, and tried to make him think she had \njust happened to drop in, things had just wo rked out that way: she was in Prague on \nbusiness, perhaps (at this point she became rather vague) to find a job. \nLater, as they lay naked and spent side by  side on the bed, he asked her where she \nwas staying. It was night by then, and he o ffered to drive her there. Embarrassed, she \nanswered that she still had to find a hotel and had left her suitcase at the station. \nOnly two days ago, he had feared that if he in vited her to Prague she would offer him \nup her life. When she told him her suitcase was at the station, he immediately realized \nthat the suitcase contained her  life and that she had left it at the station only until she \ncould offer it up to him. \nThe two of them got into his car, which was parked in front of th e house, and drove to \nthe station. There he claim ed the suitcase (it was large and enormously heavy) and \ntook it and her home. \nHow had he come to make such a sudden dec ision when for nearly a fortnight he had \nwavered so much that he could not even bring himself to send a postcard asking her \nhow she was?"

    "raw_text": "\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 6\nHe himself was surprised. He had acted a gainst his principles. Ten years earlier, when \nhe had divorced his wife, he cel ebrated the event the way ot hers celebrate a marriage. \nHe understood he was not  born to live side by side with  any woman and could be fully \nhimself only as a bachelor. He tried to des ign his life in such a way that no woman \ncould move in with a suitcase. That was why his flat had only the one bed. Even though \nit was wide enough, Tomas would tell his mist resses that he was unable to fall asleep \nwith anyone next to him, and dr ive them home after midnight. And so it was not the flu \nthat kept him from sleeping wit h Tereza on her first visit. T he first night he had slept in \nhis large armchair, and the rest of that week he drove each night to the hospital, where \nhe had a cot in his office. \nBut this time he fell asleep by her side. When he woke up the next morning, he found \nTereza, who was still asleep, holding his hand. Could they have been hand in hand all \nnight? It was hard to believe. \nAnd while she breathed the dee p breath of sleep and held his hand (firmly: he was \nunable to disengage it from her grip), the enormously heavy suitcase stood by the bed. \nHe refrained from loosening his hand from her grip for fear of waking her, and turned \ncarefully on his side to observe her better. \nAgain it occurred to him that Tereza was a child put in a pitch-daubed bulrush basket \nand sent downstream. He couldn't very well le t a basket with a child in it float down a \nstormy river! If the Pharaoh's daughter hadn't snatched the basket carrying little Moses \nfrom the waves, there w ould have been no Old Testament, no civilization as we now \nknow it! How many ancient myths begin with the rescue of an abandoned child! If \nPolybus hadn't taken in the young Oedipus, Sophocles wouldn't have written his most \nbeautiful tragedy! \nTomas did not realize at t he time that metaphors are dan gerous. Metaphors are not to \nbe trifled with. A single metaphor can give birth to love. \nHe lived a scant two year s with his wife, and they had  a son. At the divorce \nproceedings, the judge awarded the infant to its mother and ordered Tomas to pay a \nthird of his salary for its support. He also  granted him the right to visit the boy every \nother week. \nBut each time Tomas was supposed to see hi m, the boy's mother found an excuse to \nkeep him away. He soon realized that bringi ng them expensive gifts would make things \na good deal easier, that he was expected to bribe the mother for the son's love. He saw \na future of quixotic attempts to inculcate his views in the boy, views opposed in every \nway to the mother's. The very thought of it exhausted him. When, one Sunday, the \nboy's mother again canceled a scheduled vi sit, Tomas decided on the spur of the \nmoment never to see him again. \nWhy should he feel more for that child, to whom he was bound by nothing but a single \nimprovident night, than for any other? He would be scrupulous about paying support; he\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 7\njust didn't want anybody making him fight for his son in the name of paternal \nsentiments! \nNeedless to say, he found no sympathizers . His own parents condemned him roundly: \nif Tomas refused to take an interest in hi s son, then they, Tomas' s parents, would no \nlonger take an interest in theirs. They made a great show of maintaining good relations \nwith their daughter-in-law and trumpeted their exemplary stance and sense of justice. \nThus in practically no time he managed to rid himself of wife, son, mother, and father. \nThe only thing they bequeathed to him was a fear of wo men. Tomas desired but feared \nthem. Needing to create a compromise between fear and desire, he devised what he \ncalled erotic friendship. He would tell his mistresses: the only relationship that can \nmake both partners happy is one in which sentimentalit y has no place and neither \npartner makes any claim on the life and freedom of the other. \nTo ensure that erotic friendship never grew into the aggression of love, he would meet \neach of his long-term mistresses only at interv als. He considered this method flawless \nand propagated it among his friends : The important thing is to abide by the rule of \nthrees. Either you see a woman three time s in quick succession a nd then never again, \nor you maintain relations over the years but make sure that the rendezvous are at least \nthree weeks apart.  \nThe rule of threes enabled To mas to keep intact his liaisons with some women while \ncontinuing to engage in short-term affair s with many others. He was not always \nunderstood. The woman who understood him best was Sabina. She was a painter. The \nreason I like you, she would say to him, is yo u're the complete opposite of kitsch. In the \nkingdom of kitsch you would be a monster.  \nIt was Sabina he turned to when he needed to find a job for Tereza in Prague. \nFollowing the unwritten ru les of erotic friendship, Sabina promised to  do everything in \nher power, and before long she had in fact located a place for Tereza in the darkroom \nof an illustrated weekly. Although her new job did not require any particular \nqualifications, it raised her st atus from waitress to member  of the press. When Sabina \nherself introduced Tereza to everyone on the weekly, Tomas knew he had never had a \nbetter friend as a mistress than Sabina. \nThe unwritten contract of erotic friendship stipulated that Tomas should exclude all love \nfrom his life. The moment he violated that clause of the c ontract, his other mistresses \nwould assume inferior status and become ripe for insurrection. \nAccordingly, he rented a room for Tereza and her heavy suitcase. He wanted to be able \nto watch over her, protect her, enjoy her pr esence, but felt no need to change his way \nof life. He did not want word to get out that Tereza was sleeping at his place: spending \nthe night together was the corpus delicti of love.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 8\nHe never spent the night with the others. It was easy enough if he was at their place: he \ncould leave whenever he pleased. It was wors e when they were at his and he had to \nexplain that come midnight he would hav e to drive them home because he was an \ninsomniac and found it impossible to fall asl eep in close proximity to another person. \nThough it was not far from the truth, he never dared tell them the whole truth: \nafter making love he had an uncontrollable cr aving to be by himself; waking in the \nmiddle of the night at the side of an alien body was distasteful to him, rising in the \nmorning with an intruder repellent; he had no desire to be overheard brushing his teeth \nin the bathroom, nor was he enticed by the thought of an intimate breakfast. \nThat is why he was so surprised to wake up and find Tereza squeezing his hand tightly. \nLying there looking at her, he could not quite understand what had happened. But as he \nran through the previous few hours in his mind, he began to sense an aura of hitherto \nunknown happiness emanating from them. \nFrom that time on they both looked forward to sleeping together. I might even say that \nthe goal of their lovemaking was not so much pleasure as the sleep that followed it. She \nespecially was affected. Whenever she stayed overnight in her rented room (which \nquickly became only an alibi for Tomas), she was unable to fall asleep; in his arms she \nwould fall asleep no matter how wrought up she might have been. He would whisper \nimpromptu fairy tales about her , or gibberish, words he r epeated monotonously, words \nsoothing or comical, which turned into vague  visions lulling her through the first dreams \nof the night. He had complete control over her sleep: she dozed off at the second he \nchose. \nWhile they slept, she held him as on the firs t night, keeping a firm grip on wrist, finger, \nor ankle. If he wanted to move without waking her, he had to resort to artifice. After \nfreeing his finger (wrist, ankle) from her cl utches, a process which, since she guarded \nhim carefully even in her sleep, never failed to rouse her partially, he would calm her by \nslipping an object into her hand (a rolled-up paj ama top, a slipper, a book), which she \nthen gripped as tightly as if it were a part of his body. \nOnce, when he had just lulled her to sleep but she had gone no farther than dream's \nantechamber and was therefore st ill responsive to him, he said to her, Good-bye, I'm \ngoing now. Where? she asked in her sleep. Away, he answered sternly. Then I'm going \nwith you, she said, sitting up in bed. No, y ou can't. I'm going away for good, he said, \ngoing out into the hall. She stood up and followed him ou t, squinting. She was naked \nbeneath her short nightdress. Her face wa s blank, expressionle ss, but she moved \nenergetically. He walked through the hall of the flat into t he hall of the bui lding (the hall \nshared by all the occupants), closing the door in her face. S he flung it open and \ncontinued to follow him, convinced in her sl eep that he meant to leave her for good and \nshe had to stop him. He walked  down the stairs to the first landing and waited for her \nthere. She went down after him, took him by the hand, and led him back to bed. \nTomas came to this conclusion: Making lo ve with a woman and sleeping with a woman \nare two separate passions, not merely different  but opposite. Love does not make itself \nfelt in the desire for copulati on (a desire that extends to an infinite number of women) \nbut in the desire for shared sleep (a desire limited to one woman).\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 9\nIn the middle of the night she started moaning in her sleep. Tomas woke her up, but \nwhen she saw his face she said, with hatred in  her voice, Get away from me! Get away \nfrom me! Then she told him her dream: The two of them and Sabina had been in a big \nroom together. There was a bed in the middle of the room. It  was like a platform in the \ntheater. Tomas ordered her to stand in the corner while he made love to Sabina. The \nsight of it caused Tereza intolerable suffering.  Hoping to alleviate the pain in her heart \nby pains of the flesh, she jabbed needles under her finger nails. It hurt so much, she \nsaid, squeezing her hands into fists as if they actually were wounded. \nHe pressed her to him, and she gradually (trembling violently for a long time) fell asleep \nin his arms. \nThinking about the dream t he next day, he remembered so mething. He opened a desk \ndrawer and took out a packet of letters Sabi na had written to him. He was not long in \nfinding the following passage: I want to make love to you in my studio. It will be like a \nstage surrounded by people. The audience won't be allowed up close, but they won't be \nable to take their eyes off us....  \nThe worst of it was that the letter was dat ed. It was quite recen t, written long after \nTereza had moved in with Tomas. \nSo you've been rummaging in my letters!  \nShe did not deny it. Throw me out, then!  \nBut he did not throw her out. He could pictur e her pressed against the wall of Sabina's \nstudio jabbing needles up under  her nails. He took her fingers between his hands and \nstroked them, brought them to his lips and kissed them, as if they still had drops of \nblood on them. \nBut from that time on, everything seemed to  conspire against him. Not a day went by \nwithout her learning something about his secret life. \nAt first he denied it all. Then, when the evidence became too blatant, he argued that his \npolygamous way of life did not in the least run counter to his love for her. He was \ninconsistent: first he disavowed his infidelities, then he tried to justify them. \nOnce he was saying good-bye after making a date with a woman on the phone, when \nfrom the next room came a strange sound like the chatteri ng of teeth.By chance she \nhad come home without his realizing it. Sh e was pouring something from a medicine \nbottle down her throat, and her hand shook so badly the glass bottle clicked against her \nteeth. \nHe pounced on her as if trying to save her fr om drowning. The bottle fell to the floor, \nspotting the carpet with valerian drops. She put up a good fight, and he had to keep her \nin a straitjacket-like hold for a quarter of an hour before he could calm her. \nHe knew he was in an unjustifiable situation, based as it was on complete inequality.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 10\nOne evening, before she discovered his correspondence with Sabina, they had gone to \na bar with some friends to celebrate Tere za's new job. She had  been promoted at the \nweekly from darkroom technician to sta ff photographer. Because he had never been \nmuch for dancing, one of his younger coll eagues took over. They made a splendid \ncouple on the dance floor, and Tomas found her more beautiful than ever. He looked on \nin amazement at the split-second prec ision and deference with which Tereza \nanticipated her partner's will. The dance seem ed to him a declaration that her devotion, \nher ardent desire to satisfy his every whim , was not necessarily bound to his person, \nthat if she hadn't met Tomas, she would ha ve been ready to respond to the call of any \nother man she might have met instead. He had no difficulty imagining Tereza and his \nyoung colleague as lovers. And the ease with wh ich he arrived at this fiction wounded \nhim. He realized that Tereza's body was perfectly thinkable coupled with any male \nbody, and the thought put him in a foul mood. Not until late that night, at home, did he \nadmit to her he was jealous. \nThis absurd jealousy, grounded as it was in mere hypotheses, proved that he \nconsidered her fidelity an unconditional postulate of their re lationship. How then could \nhe begrudge her her jealousy of his very real mistresses? \nDuring the day, she tried (though  with only partial success) to  believe what Tomas told \nher and to be as cheerful as she had been be fore. But her jealousy thus tamed by day \nburst forth all the more sav agely in her dreams, each of wh ich ended in a wail he could \nsilence only by waking her. \nHer dreams recurred like themes and variations  or television series. For example, she \nrepeatedly dreamed of cats jumpi ng at her face and digging their claws into her skin. \nWe need not look far for an interpretation: in Czech slang the word cat means a pretty \nwoman. Tereza saw herself threatened by  women, all women.  All women were \npotential mistresses for Tomas, and she feared them all. \nIn another cycle she was being sent to her  death. Once, when he woke her as she \nscreamed in terror in the dead of night, she told him about it. I was at a large indoor \nswimming pool. There were about twenty of us . All women. We were naked and had to \nmarch around the pool. There was a baske t hanging from the ceiling and a man \nstanding in the basket. The man wore a broad-brimmed hat  shading his face, but I \ncould see it was you. You kept giving us or ders. Shouting at us. We had to sing as we \nmarched, sing and do kneebends. If one of us  did a bad kneebend,  you would shoot \nher with a pistol and she would fall dead into  the pool. Which made everybody laugh \nand sing even louder. You never took your  eyes off us, and the minute we did \nsomething wrong, you would shoot. The pool was full of corpses floating just below the \nsurface. And I knew I lacked the strengt h to do the next kneebend and you were going \nto shoot me!  \nIn a third cycle she was dead. \nbying in a hearse as big as a furniture van, she was surrounded by dead women. There \nwere so many of them that the back door would not close and several legs dangled out. \nBut I'm not dead! Tereza cried. I can still feel!\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 11\nSo can we, the corpses laughed. \nThey laughed the same laugh as  the live women who used to te ll her cheerfully it was \nperfectly normal that one day sh e would have bad teeth, faul ty ovaries, and wrinkles, \nbecause they all had bad teeth, faulty ovaries, and wrinkles. Laughing the same laugh, \nthey told her that she was dead and it was perfectly all right! \nSuddenly she felt a need to urinate. You s ee, she cried. I need to pee. That's proof \npositive I'm not dead!  \nBut they only laughed again. Needing to pee is perfectly normal! they said. You'll go on \nfeeling that kind of thing for a long time ye t. Like a person who ha s an arm cut off and \nkeeps feeling it's there. We may not have a drop of pee left in us, but we keep needing \nto pee.  \nTereza huddled against Tomas in bed. And the way they talked to me! Like old friends, \npeople who'd known me forever. I was appall ed at the thought of having to stay with \nthem forever.  \nAll languages that derive from Latin form the word compassion by combining the prefix \nmeaning with (corn-) and the root meaning suffering (Late Latin, passio).  In other lan-\nguages—Czech, Polish, German, and Swedish, fo r instance— this word is translated \nby a noun formed of an equivalent prefix combined with the word that means feeling \n(Czech, sou-cit; Polish, wspol-czucie; German, Mit-gefuhl; Swedish, med-kansia). \nIn languages that derive from Latin, compa ssion means: we cannot look on coolly as \nothers suffer; or, we sympathize with t hose who suffer. Another word with \napproximately the same meaning, pity (French, pitie;  Italian, pieta;  etc.), connotes a \ncertain condescension towards the sufferer. To take pity on a woman means that we \nare better off than she, that we stoop to her level, lower ourselves. \nThat is why the word compassi on generally inspires suspici on; it designates what is \nconsidered an inferior, second-rate sentiment that has little to do with love. To love \nsomeone out of compassion means not really to love. \nIn languages that form the word compassion not from the root suffering but from the \nroot feeling, the word is us ed in approximately the same way, but to contend that it \ndesignates a bad or inferior sentiment is diffi cult. The secret str ength of its etymology \nfloods the word with another light and gives it a broader meaning: to have compassion \n(co-feeling) means not only to be able to live with the other's misfortune but also to feel \nwith him any emotion—joy, anxiety, happiness, pain. This kind of compassion (in the \nsense of souc/r, wspofczucie, Mitgefuhl, medkansia)  therefore signifies the maximal \ncapacity of affective imagination, the art of  emotional telepathy. In the hierarchy of \nsentiments, then, it is supreme. \nBy revealing to Tomas her dream about jabbing needles under her fingernails, Tereza \nunwittingly revealed that she had gone throu gh his desk. If Tereza had been any other"

    "raw_text": "\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 12\nwoman, Tomas would never have spoken to her  again. Aware of that, Tereza said to \nhim, Throw me out! But instead of throwin g her out, he seized her hand and kissed the \ntips of her fingers, because at that moment he himself felt the pain under her fingernails \nas surely as if the nerves of her fingers led straight to his own brain. \nAnyone who has failed to benef it from the Devil's gift of compassion (co-feeling) will \ncondemn Tereza coldly for her deed, because privacy is sacred and drawers containing \nintimate correspondence are not to be opened. But because compassion was Tomas's \nfate (or curse), he felt that he himself had knelt before the open de sk drawer, unable to \ntear his eyes from Sabina's letter. He  understood Tereza, and not only was he inca-\npable of being angry with her, he loved her all the more. \nHer gestures grew abrupt and unsteady. Two years had elapsed since she discovered \nhe was unfaithful, and things had grown worse. There was no way out. \nWas he genuinely incapable of abandoning his erotic friends hips? He was. It would \nhave torn him apart. He lacked the strength to control his taste for other women. \nBesides, he failed to see the need. No one k new better than he how little his exploits \nthreatened Tereza. Why then give them up? He  saw no more reason for that than to \ndeny himself soccer matches. \nBut was it still a matter of pleasure? Even as  he set out to visit another woman, he \nfound her distasteful and promised himself he would not see her again. He constantly \nhad Tereza's image before his eyes, and the onl y way he could erase it was by quickly \ngetting drunk. Ever since meeting Tereza, he had been unable to ma ke love to other \nwomen without alcohol! But alcohol on his breath was a sure sign to Tereza of infidelity. \nHe was caught in a trap: even on his way to  see them, he found them  distasteful, but \none day without them and he was back on the phone, eager to make contact. \nHe still felt most comfortable with Sabina.  He knew she was discreet and would not \ndivulge their rendezvous. Her studio greeted him like a memento of his past, his idyllic \nbachelor past. \nPerhaps he himself did not realize how much he had changed: he was now afraid to \ncome home late, because Tereza would be waiting up for him. Then one day Sabina \ncaught him glancing at his watch during intercourse and trying to hasten its conclusion. \nAfterwards, still naked and lazily walkin g across the studio, she stopped before an \neasel with a half-finished painting and watched him sidelong as he threw on his clothes. \nWhen he was fully dressed except for one bar e foot, he looked ar ound the room, and \nthen got down on all fours to continue the search under a table. \nYou seem to be turning into the theme of all my paintings, she said. The meeting of two \nworlds. A double exposure. Showing through the outline of Tomas the libertine, in-\ncredibly, the face of a rom antic lover. Or, t he other way, through a Tristan, always \nthinking of his Tereza, I see the beautiful, betrayed world of the libertine.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 13\nTomas straightened up and, distractedly, listened to Sabina's words. \nWhat are you looking for? she asked. \nA sock.  \nShe searched all over the room with him, and again he got down on all fours to look \nunder the table. \nYour sock isn't anywhere to be seen, said Sabina. You must have come without it.  \nHow could I have come without it? cried Tomas,  looking at his watch. I wasn't wearing \nonly one sock when I came, was I? \nIt's not out of the question. You've been very absent-minded lately. Always rushing \nsomewhere, looking at your watch. It wouldn't surprise me in the least if you forgot to \nput on a sock.  \nHe was just about to put his shoe on his bare foot. It's cold out, Sabina said. I'll lend you \none of my stockings.  \nShe handed him a long, white, fashionable, wide-net stocking. \nHe knew very well she was getting back at hi m for glancing at his watch while making \nlove to her. She had hidden his sock somewhere. It was indeed cold out, and he had no \nchoice but to take her up on the offer. He  went home wearing a sock on one foot and a \nwide-net stocking rolled down over his ankle on the other. \nHe was in a bind: in his mistresses' eyes, he bore the stigma of his love for Tereza; in \nTereza's eyes, the stigma of his exploits with the mistresses. \nTo assuage Tereza's sufferings, he married her  (they could finally give up the room, \nwhich she had not lived in for quite some time) and gave her a puppy. \nIt was born to a Saint Bernard owned by a colleague. The sire was a neighbor's \nGerman shepherd. No one wanted the little mongrels, and his colleague was loath to \nkill them. \nLooking over the puppies, Tomas knew that the ones he rejected would have to die. He \nfelt like the president of the republic standing before four prisoners condemned to death \nand empowered to pardon only one of  them. At last he made his choice: a bitch whose \nbody seemed reminiscent of the German shepherd and whose head belonged to its \nSaint Bernard mother. He took it home to Tereza, who picked it up and pressed it to her \nbreast. The puppy immediately peed on her blouse. \nThen they tried to come up with a name for it. Tomas wanted the name to be a clear \nindication that the dog was Tereza's, and  he thought of the book she was clutching \nunder her arm when she arrived unannounced in Prague. He suggested they call the \npuppy Tolstoy.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 14\nIt can't be Tolstoy, Tereza said. It's a girl. How about Anna Karenina?  \nIt can't be Anna Karenina, said Tomas. No woman could possibly have so funny a face. \nIt's much more like Karenin. Yes, Anna's hus band. That's just how I've always pictured \nhim.  \nBut won't calling her Karenin affect her sexuality?  \nIt is entirely possible, said Tomas, that a female dog addressed continually by a male \nname will develop lesbian tendencies.  \nStrangely enough, Tomas's words came true.  Though bitches are usually more \naffectionate to their masters than to their mistresses, Karenin proved an exception, \ndeciding that he was in love with Tereza. To mas was grateful to him for it. He would \nstroke the puppy's head and say, Well done, Karenin! That's just what I wanted you for. \nSince I can't cope with her by myself, you must help me.  \nBut even with Karenin's help Tomas failed to  make her happy. He became aware of his \nfailure some years later, on approximately t he tenth day after his country was occupied \nby Russian tanks. It was August 1968, and Toma s was receiving daily phone calls from \na hospital in Zurich. The director there, a physician who had struck up a friendship with \nTomas at an international c onference, was worried about him and kept offering him a \njob. \nIf Tomas rejected the Swiss doctor's offer wit hout a second thought, it was for Tereza's \nsake. He assumed she would not want to leave. She had spent the whole first week of \nthe occupation in a kind of trance almost resembling happ iness. After roaming the \nstreets with her camera, she would hand the rolls of film to foreign journalists, who \nactually fought over them. Once, when she went too far and took a close-up of an \nofficer pointing his revolver at a group of  people, she was arrested and kept overnight \nat Russian military headquarters. There they threatened to shoot her, but no sooner did \nthey let her go than she was back in the streets with her camera. \nThat is why Tomas was surprise d when on the tenth day of the occupation she said to \nhim, Why is it you don't want to go to Switzerland?               ' \nWhy should I?  \nThey could make it hard for you here.  \nThey can make it hard for anybody, replied Tomas with a wave of the hand. What about \nyou? Could you live abroad?  \nWhy not?  \nYou've been out there risking your life for this country. How can you be so nonchalant \nabout leaving it?  \nNow that Dubcek is back, things have changed, said Tereza.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 15\nIt was true: the general euphoria last ed no longer than the first week. The \nrepresentatives of the c ountry had been hauled away like criminals by the Russian \narmy, no one knew where they were, ever yone feared for the men's lives, and hatred \nfor the Russians drugged people like alcohol. It was a drunken carnival of hate. Czech \ntowns were decorated with thousands of hand-painted posters bearing ironic texts, \nepigrams, poems, and cartoons of  Brezhnev and his soldiers, jeered at by one and all \nas a circus of illiterates. But no carnival  can go on forever. In the meantime, the \nRussians had forced the Czech representati ves to sign a compromise agreement in \nMoscow. When Dubcek returned with them to Prague, he gave a speech over the radio. \nHe was so devastated after his six-day detention he could hardly talk; he kept stuttering \nand gasping for breath, making long pauses between sentences, pauses lasting nearly \nthirty seconds. \nThe compromise saved the country from  the worst: the executions and mass \ndeportations to Siberia that had terrified ever yone. But one thing was clear: the country \nwould have to bow to the conqueror. For ever and ever, it will stutter, stammer, gasp for \nair like Alexander Dubcek. The carnival was over. Workaday humiliation had begun. \nTereza had explained all this to Tomas and he knew that it was true. But he also knew \nthat underneath it all hid stil l another, more fundamental truth, the reason why she \nwanted to leave Prague: she had never really been happy before. \nThe days she walked through the streets of Prague ta king pictures of Russian soldiers \nand looking danger in the face were the best of her life. T hey were the only time when \nthe television series of her dreams had been interrupt ed and she had enjoyed a few \nhappy nights. The Russians had br ought equilibrium to her in their tanks, and now that \nthe carnival was over, she feared her ni ghts again and wanted to escape them. She \nnow knew there were conditions under which she could feel str ong and fulfilled, and \nshe longed to go off into the world and seek those conditions somewhere else. \nIt doesn't bother you that Sabina has also emigrated to Switzerland? Tomas asked. \nGeneva isn't Zurich, said Tereza. She'll be much less of a difficulty there than she was \nin Prague.  \nA person who longs to leave the place wher e he lives is an unhappy person. That is \nwhy Tomas accepted Tereza's wish to emigrate as the culprit accepts his sentence, \nand one day he and Tereza and Karenin found themselves in the largest city in \nSwitzerland. \nHe bought a bed for their empty flat (they had no money yet for other furniture) and \nthrew himself into his work with the frenzy of a man of forty beginning a new life. \nHe made several telephone calls to Geneva. A show of Sabina's work had opened \nthere by chance a week after the Russian invasion, and in a wave of sympathy for her \ntiny country, Geneva's patrons of the arts bought up all her paintings.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 16\nThanks to the Russians, I'm a rich woman, she said, laughing into  the telephone. She \ninvited Tomas to come and see her new studio,  and assured him it did not differ greatly \nfrom the one he had known in Prague. \nHe would have been only too gl ad to visit her, but was unable to find an excuse to \nexplain his absence to Tereza. And so Sabina came to Zurich. She stayed at a hotel. \nTomas went to see her after work. He phoned first from the reception desk, then went \nupstairs. When she opened the door, she stood before him on her beautiful long legs \nwearing nothing but panties and bra. And a black bowler hat. She stood there staring, \nmute and motionless. Tomas did the same. Suddenly he realized how touched he was. \nHe removed the bowler from her head and pl aced it on the bedside table. Then they \nmade love without saying a word. \nLeaving the hotel for his Hat (which by now had acquired table, chairs, couch, and \ncarpet), he thought happily that  he carried his way of living with him as a snail carries \nhis house. Tereza and Sabina represented t he two poles of his life, separate and \nirreconcilable, yet equally appealing. \nBut the fact that he carried his life-support system with him everywhere like a part of his \nbody meant that Tereza went on having her dreams. \nThey had been in Zurich for six or seven months when he came home late one evening \nto find a letter on the table telling him she had left for Prague. She had left because she \nlacked the strength to live abr oad. She knew she was suppos ed to bolster him up, but \ndid not know how to go about it. She had been silly enough to think that going abroad \nwould change her. She thought  that after what she had been through du ring the inva-\nsion she would stop being petty and grow up,  grow wise and st rong, but she had \noverestimated herself. She was weighing him down and would do so no longer. She \nhad drawn the necessary conclusions before it was too late. And she apologized for \ntaking Karenin with her. \nHe took some sleeping pills but still did not close his eyes until morning. Luckily it was \nSaturday and he could stay at home. For t he hundred and fiftieth time he went over the \nsituation: the borders between his country and the rest of the world were no longer \nopen. No telegrams or telepho ne calls could bring her ba ck. The authorities would \nnever let her travel abroad. Her departure was staggeringly definitive. \nThe realization that he was utterly powerless  was like the blow of a sledgehammer, yet \nit was curiously calming as well. No one wa s forcing him into a decision. He felt no \nneed to stare at the walls of the houses across the courtyard and ponder whether to live \nwith her or not. Tereza had made the decision herself. \nHe went to a restaurant for lunch. He wa s depressed, but as he ate, his original \ndesperation waned, lost its strength, and soon all that was left was melancholy. Looking \nback on the years he had spent with her, he came to feel that their story could have had \nno better ending. If someone had invented the stor y, this is how he would have had to \nend it."

    "raw_text": "\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 17\nOne day Tereza came to him uninvited. One day she left the same way. She came with \na heavy suitcase. She left with a heavy suitcase. \nHe paid the bill, left the restaurant, and started walking through  the streets, his \nmelancholy growing more and more beautiful . He had spent seven years of life with \nTereza, and now he realized that those years were more attractive in retrospect than \nthey were when he was living them. \nHis love for Tereza was beautiful, but it wa s also tiring: he had constantly had to hide \nthings from her, sham, dissemble, make amends, buck her up, calm her down, give her \nevidence of his feelings, play the defendant to her jealousy, her suffering, and her \ndreams, feel guilty, make excuses and apologies. Now what was tiring had disappeared \nand only the beauty remained. \nSaturday found him for the first time strolling alone through Zurich, breathing in the \nheady smell of his freedom. Ne w adventures hid around each  corner. The future was \nagain a secret. He was on his way back to the bachelor life, the life he had once felt \ndestined for, the life that would let him be what he actually was. \nFor seven years he had lived bo und to her, his every step s ubject to her scrutiny. She \nmight as well have chained iron balls to his ankles. Suddenly his step was much lighter. \nHe soared. He had entered Parmenides' magic field: he was enjoying the sweet \nlightness of being. \n(Did he feel like phoning S abina in Geneva? Contacting on e or another of the women \nhe had met during his several months in Zu rich? No, not in the least. Perhaps he \nsensed that any woman would make his memory of Tereza unbearably painful.) \nThis curious melancholic fascination lasted until Sunday evening. .On Monday, \neverything changed. Tereza forced her way in to his thoughts: he imagined her sitting \nthere writing her farewell letter; he felt her hands trembling; he saw her lugging her \nheavy suitcase in one hand and leading Karenin on his leash with the other; he pictured \nher unlocking their Prague flat, and suffered the utter abandonment breathing her in the \nface as she opened the door. \nDuring those two beautiful days of melancholy, his compassion (that curse of emotional \ntelepathy) had taken a holiday. It had slept t he sound Sunday sleep of a miner who, \nafter a hard week's work, needs to gather strength for his Monday shift. \nInstead of the patients he was treating, Tomas saw Tereza. \nHe tried to remind himself. Don't think about her! Don't think about her! He said to \nhimself, I'm sick with compassion. It's good that she's gone and that I'll never see her \nagain, though it's not Tereza I need to be free of—it's that sickness, compassion, which \nI thought I was immune to until she infected me with it. \nOn Saturday and Sunday, he felt the sweet lightness of being rise up to him out of the \ndepths of the future. On Monday, he was hit by a weight the likes of which he had never \nknown. The tons of steel of the Russian t anks were nothing compared with it. For there\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 18\nis nothing heavier than compassion. Not ev en one's own pain weighs so heavy as the \npain one feels with someone, for someone, a pain intensified by the imagination and \nprolonged by a hundred echoes. \nHe kept warning himself not to give in to compassion, and compassion listened with \nbowed head and a seemingly guilty conscience. Compassion knew it was being \npresumptuous, yet it quietly stood its ground, and on the fi fth day after her departure \nTomas informed the director of his hospital (the man who had phoned him daily in \nPrague after the Russian invasion) that he had to return at once. He was ashamed. He \nknew that the move would appear irresponsib le, inexcusable to the man. He thought to \nunbosom himself and tell him the story of Tereza and the letter she had left on the table \nfor him. But in the end he did not. From the S wiss doctor's point of view Tereza's move \ncould only appear hysterical and abhorrent. And Tomas refused to allow anyone an \nopportunity to think ill of her. The director of the hospital was in fact offended. Tomas \nshrugged his shoulders and said, Es muss sein. Es muss sein.  \nIt was an allusion. The last movement of  Beethoven's last quartet is based on the \nfollowing two motifs: \nTo make the meaning of the words abs olutely clear, Beethoven introduced the \nmovement with a phrase, Der schwer gefasste Entschluss, which is commonly \ntranslated as the difficult resolution.  \nThis allusion to Beethoven was actually Tomas's first step back to Tereza, because she \nwas the one who had induced him to buy records of the Beethoven quartets and \nsonatas. \nThe allusion was even more pertinent than  he had thought because  the Swiss doctor \nwas a great music lover. Smiling serenely, he asked, in the me lody of Beethoven's \nmotif, Muss es sein?  \n]a, es muss sein! Tomas said again. \nUnlike Parmenides, Beethoven apparently viewed weight as something positive. Since \nthe German word schwer means both difficult and heavy, Beethoven's difficult resolu-\ntion may also be construed as a heavy or weight y resolution. The weig hty resolution is \nat one with the voice of Fate (  Es muss sein! ); necessity, weight, and value are three \nconcepts inextricably bound: only necessity is heavy, and only what is heavy has value. \nThis is a conviction born of Beethoven' s music, and although we cannot ignore the \npossibility (or even probability) that it owes its origins more to Beethoven's \ncommentators than to Beethoven himself, we all more or less share, it: we believe that \nthe greatness of man stems from the fact that he bears his fate as Atlas bore the \nheavens on his shoulders. Beethoven's hero is a lifter of metaphysical weights. \nTomas approached the Swiss border. I imagine a gloomy, shock-headed Beethoven, in \nperson, conducting the local fi remen's brass band in a farewell to emigration, an Es \nMuss Sein march.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 19\nThen Tomas crossed the Czech border and was welcomed by columns of Russian \ntanks. He had to stop his car and wait a half hour before they passed. A terrifying \nsoldier in the black Uniform of the armor ed forces stood at the crossroads directing \ntraffic as if every road in the country belonged to him and him alone. \nEs muss sein! Tomas repeated to himself, but then he began to doubt. Did it really have \nto be? \nYes, it was unbearable for him to stay in Zu rich imagining Tereza  living on her own in \nPrague. \nBut how long would he have be en tortured by compassion? Al l his life? A year? Or a \nmonth? Or only a week? \nHow could he have known? How could he have gauged it? Any schoolboy can do \nexperiments in the physics laboratory to test  various scientific hypotheses. But man, \nbecause he has only one life to live, cannot conduct experiments to test whether to \nfollow his passion (compassion) or not. \nIt was with these thoughts in mind that he opened the door to his flat. Karenin made the \nhomecoming easier by jumping up on him and licking his face. The desire to fall into \nTereza's arms (he could still feel it while getting into his car in Zurich) had completely \ndisintegrated. He fancied hims elf standing opposite her in th e midst of a snowy plain, \nthe two of them shivering from the cold. \nFrom the very beginning of the occupation, Russian milit ary airplanes had flown over \nPrague all night long. Tomas, no longer a ccustomed to the noise, was unable to fall \nasleep. \nTwisting and turning beside the slumbering Tereza, he recalled something she had told \nhim a long time before in the course of an  insignificant conver sation. They had been \ntalking about his friend Z. when she announced,  If I hadn't met you,  I'd certainly have \nfallen in love with him.  \nEven then, her words had left Tomas in a st range state of melanc holy, and now he \nrealized it was only a matter of chance that Tereza loved him and not his friend Z. Apart \nfrom her consummated love for Tomas, there were, in the realm of possibility, an infinite \nnumber of unconsummated loves for other men. \nWe all reject out of hand t he idea that the love of our life may be something light or \nweightless; we presume our love is what must be, that without it our life would no longer \nbe the same; we feel that Beethoven himself, gloomy and awe-inspiring, is playing the \nEs muss sein! to our own great love. \nTomas often thought of Tereza's remark about his friend Z. and came to the conclusion \nthat the love story of his life exemplified not Es muss sein! (It must be so), but rather Es \nkonnte auch anders sein (It could just as well be otherwise). \nSeven years earlier, a complex neurological case happened to have been discovered at \nthe hospital in Tereza's town. They called in the chief surgeon of Tomas's hospital in"

    "raw_text": "\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 20\nPrague for consultation, but the ch ief surgeon of Tomas's hospital happened  to be \nsuffering from sciatica, and because he could not move he sent Tomas to the provincial \nhospital in his place. The town  had several hotels, but Tomas happened  to be given a \nroom in the one where Tereza was employed. He happened to have had enough free \ntime before his train left to stop at the hotel restaurant. Tereza happened to  be on duty, \nand happened to be serving Tomas's table. It had taken six chance happenings to push \nTomas towards Tereza, as if he had little inclination to go to her on his own. \nHe had gone back to Prague bec ause of her. So fateful a decision resting on so \nfortuitous a love, a love that would not ev en have existed had it not been for the chief \nsurgeon's sciatica seven years earlier. And that  woman, that personification of absolute \nfortuity, now again lay asleep beside him, breathing deeply. \nIt was late at night. His stomach started acti ng up as it tended to do in times of psychic \nstress. \nOnce or twice her breathing turned into mild  snores. Tomas felt no compassion. All he \nfelt was the pressure in his stomach and the despair of having returned. \n \nPART TWO \nSoul and Body \nIt would be senseless for the author to try to  convince the reader that his characters \nonce actually lived. They were not born of a mother's womb; they were born of a \nstimulating phrase or two or from a basic situation. Tomas was born of the saying \nEinma! ist keinmal. Tereza was born of the rumbling of a stomach. \nThe first time she went to Tomas's flat, her insides began to rumble. And no wonder: \nshe had had nothing to eat since breakfast  but a quick sandwich on the platform before \nboarding the train. She had concentrated on the daring journey ahead of her and \nforgotten about food. But when we ignore the body, we are more easily victimized by it. \nShe felt terrible standing there in front of Tomas listening to her belly speak out. She felt \nlike crying. Fortunately, after the first ten seconds Tomas put his arms around her and \nmade her forget her ventral voices. \nTereza was therefore born of a situation which brutally reveals the irreconcilable duality \nof body and soul, that fundamental human experience. \nA long time ago, man would listen in amazem ent to the sound of regular beats in his \nchest, never suspecting what they were. He was unable to identify himself with so alien \nand unfamiliar an object as the body. The body was a cage, and inside that cage was \nsomething which looked, list ened, feared, thought, and marveled; that something, that \nremainder left over after the body had been accounted for, was the soul. \nToday, of course, the body is no longer unfa miliar: we know that the beating in our \nchest is the heart and that the nose is the no zzle of a hose sticking out of the body to\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 21\ntake oxygen to the lungs. The face is noth ing but an instrument panel registering all the \nbody mechanisms: digestion, sight, hearing, respiration, thought. \nEver since man has learned to give each part of the body  a name, the body has given \nhim less trouble. He has also learned that the soul is nothing more than the gray matter \nof the brain in action. The old duality of body and soul has become shrouded in \nscientific terminology, and we can laugh at it as merely an obsolete prejudice. \nBut just make someone who has fallen in love listen to his stomach rumble, and the \nunity of body and soul, that lyrical illusion of the age of science, instantly fades away. \nTereza tried to see herself through her body. That is why, from girlhood on, she would \nstand before the mirror so often. And because she was afraid her mother would catch \nher at it, every peek into the mirror had a tinge of secret vice. \nIt was not vanity that drew her to the mirror; it was amazement at seeing her own I. She \nforgot she was looking at the instrument panel of her body mechanisms; she thought \nshe saw her soul shining through the features of her face. She forgot that the nose was \nmerely the nozzle of a hose that took oxy gen to the lungs; she saw it as the true \nexpression of her nature. \nStaring at herself for long stretches of time , she was occasionally ups et at the sight of \nher mother's features in her face. She w ould stare all the more doggedly at her image \nin an attempt to wish them away and keep only what was hers alone. Each time she \nsucceeded was a time of intoxication: her soul would rise to the surface of her body like \na crew charging up from the bowels of a ship , spreading out over the deck, waving at \nthe sky and singing in jubilation. \nShe took after her mother, and not only physi cally. I sometimes have the feeling that \nher entire life was merely a c ontinuation of her mother's, mu ch as the course of a ball \non the billiard table is merely the continuation of the player's arm movement. \nIndeed, was she not the principal culprit determining her mother's fate? She, the absurd \nencounter of the sperm of the most manly of men and the egg  of the most beautiful of \nwomen? Yes, it was in that fateful second, which was named Tereza , that the botched \nlong-distance race, her mother's life, had begun. \nTereza's mother never stopped reminding her that being a mother meant sacrificing \neverything. Her words had the ring of truth, backed as they were by the experience of a \nwoman who had lost everything because of her child. Tereza  would listen and believe \nthat being a mother was the hi ghest value in life and that being a mother was a great \nsacrifice. If a mother was Sacrifice per sonified, then a daughter was Guilt, with no \npossibility of redress. \nOf course, Tereza did not know the story of the night when her mother whispered Be \ncareful into the ear of her father. Her guilt y conscience was as vague as original sin. \nBut she did what she could to rid herself of it. Her mother took her out of school at the \nage of fifteen, and Tereza went to work as  a waitress, handing over all her earnings.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 22\nShe was willing to do anything to gain her mother's love. She ran the household, took \ncare of her siblings, and spent all day Sunday cleaning house and doing the family \nwash. It was a pity, because she was the brightest in her class. She yearned for \nsomething higher, but in the small town there was nothing higher for her. Whenever she \ndid the clothes, she kept a book next to t he tub. As she turned the pages, the wash \nwater dripped all over them. \nAt home, there was no such thing as shame. Her mother marched about the flat in her \nunderwear, sometimes braless and sometime s, on summer days, stark naked. Her \nstepfather did not walk about naked, but he did go into the bathroom every time Tereza \nwas in the bath. Once she locked herself in and her mot her was furious. Who do you \nthink you are, anyway? Do you think he's going to bite off a piece of your beauty?  \n(This confrontation shows clearly that hat red for her daughter outweighed suspicion of \nher husband. Her daughter's gu ilt was infinite and included  the husband's infidelities. \nTereza's desire to be emancipated and insist  on her rights—like the right to lock herself \nin the bathroom—was more objectionable to Tere za's mother than the possibility of her \nhusband's taking a prurient interest in Tereza.) \nOnce her mother decided to go naked in t he winter when the lights were on. Tereza \nquickly ran to pull the curtains so that no one could see her  from across the street. She \nheard her mother's laughter behind her. The following day her mother had some friends \nover: a neighbor, a woman she worked with, a local schoolmistress, and two or three \nother women in the habit of getting together regularly. Tere za and the sixteen-year-old \nson of one of them came in at one point to say hello, and her mother immediately took \nadvantage of their presence to  tell how Tereza had tried to protect her mother's \nmodesty. She laughed, and all the women laughed with her. Tereza can't reconcile \nherself to the idea that the human body pisses and farts, she said. Tereza turned bright \nred, but her mother would not  stop. What's so terrible about  that? and in answer to her \nown question she broke wind loudly. All the women laughed again. \nTereza's mother blew her nose noisily, talk ed to people in public about her sex life, and \nenjoyed demonstrating her false teeth. She was remarkably skillful at loosening them \nwith her tongue, and in the midst of a broad smile would cause the uppers to drop down \nover the lowers in such a way as to give her face a sinister expression. \nHer behavior was but a single grand gesture, a casting off of youth and beauty. In the \ndays when she had had nine suitors kneeli ng round her in a circle, she guarded her \nnakedness apprehensively, as though trying to express the value of  her body in terms \nof the modesty she accorded it. Now she had not only lost that modesty, she had \nradically broken with it, ceremoniously using her new immodesty to draw a dividing line \nthrough her life and proclaim that youth and beauty were overrated and worthless. \nTereza appears to me a continuation of the gesture by which her mother cast off her life \nas a young beauty, cast it far behind her.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 23\n(And if Tereza has a nervous way of moving, if her gestures lack a certain easy grace, \nwe must not be surprised: her mother's grand, wild, and self-destructive gesture has left \nan indelible imprint on her.) \nTereza's mother demanded justice. She want ed to see the culprit penalized. That is \nwhy she insisted her daughter re main with her in the worl d of immodesty, where youth \nand beauty mean nothing, where the world is not hing but a vast concentration camp of \nbodies, one like the next, with souls invisible. \nNow we can better understand t he meaning of Tereza's secret vice, her long looks and \nfrequent glances in the mirror. It was a battle with her mother. It was a longing to be a \nbody unlike other bodies, to find  that the surface of her face reflected the crew of the \nsoul charging up from below. It was not an ea sy task: her soul—her sad, timid, self-\neffacing soul—lay concealed in the depths of her bowels and was ashamed to show \nitself. \nSo it was the day she first met Tomas. W eaving its way through the drunks in the hotel \nrestaurant, her body sagged under the weight of the beers on the tray, and her soul lay \nsomewhere at the level of the stomach or  pancreas. Then Tomas called to her. That \ncall meant a great deal, because it came fr om someone who knew neither her mother \nnor the drunks with their daily  stereotypically scabrous remarks. His outsider status \nraised him above the rest. \nSomething else raised him above the others as well: he had an open book on his table. \nNo one had ever opened a book in that restaurant before. In Tereza's eyes, books were \nthe emblems of a secret brotherhood. For she had but a single weapon against the \nworld of crudity surrounding her: the books s he took out of the municipal library, and \nabove all, the novels. She h ad read any number of them, from Fielding to Thomas \nMann. They not only offered the possibility of an imaginary escape from a life she found \nunsatisfying; they also had a meaning for her as physical objects: she loved to walk \ndown the street with a book under her arm. It had the same significance for her as an \nelegant cane for the dandy a century ago. It differentiated her from others. \n(Comparing the book to the el egant cane of the dandy is not  absolutely precise. A \ndandy's cane did more than make him diff erent; it made him modern and up to date. \nThe book made Tereza different, but old-fa shioned. Of course, she was too young to \nsee how old-fashioned she look ed to others. The young men walking by with transistor \nradios pressed to their ears seemed silly to her . It never occurred to her that they were \nmodern.) \nAnd so the man who called to her was si multaneously a stranger and a member of the \nsecret brotherhood. He called to her in a kind voice, and Tereza felt her soul rushing up \nto the surface through her blood vessels and pores to show itself to him. \nAfter Tomas had returned to Prague from Zu rich, he began to feel uneasy at the \nthought that his acquaintance with Tereza was the result of six improbable fortuities.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 24\nBut is not an event in fact more significant and noteworth y the greater the number of \nfortuities necessary to bring it about? \nChance and chance alone has a message for us. Everything that occurs out of \nnecessity, everything expected, repeated day in and day out, is mute. Only chance can \nspeak to us. We read its message much as gypsies read the images made by coffee \ngrounds at the bottom of a cup. \nTomas appeared to Tereza in the hotel restaur ant as chance in the absolute. There he \nsat, poring over an open book, when suddenly he raised his eyes to her, smiled, and \nsaid, A cognac, please.  \nAt that moment, the radio happened to be  playing music. On her way behind the \ncounter to pour the cognac, Tereza turned the volume up. She recognized Beethoven. \nShe had known his music from the time a string quartet from Pr ague had visited their \ntown. Tereza (who, as we know, yearned for something higher ) went to the concert. \nThe hall was nearly empty. The only other people in the audience were the local \npharmacist and his wife. And although the quar tet of musicians on stage faced only a \ntrio of spectators down below, they were kind enough not to c ancel the concert, and \ngave a private performance of the last three Beethoven quartets. \nThen the pharmacist invited the musicians to dinner and asked the girl in the audience \nto come along with them. From then on, Be ethoven became her image of the world on \nthe other side, the world she yearned for.  Rounding the counter with Tomas's cognac, \nshe tried to read chance's message: How was it  possible that at t he very moment she \nwas taking an order of cognac to a stranger she found attractive, at that very moment \nshe heard Beethoven? \nNecessity knows no magic formulae—they are all left to chance. If a love is to be \nunforgettable, fortuities must immediately start fluttering down to it like birds to Francis \nof Assisi's shoulders. \nHe called her back to pay for the cognac. He closed his book (the emblem of the secret \nbrotherhood), and she thought of asking him what he was reading. \nCan you have it charged to my room? he asked. \nYes, she said. What number are you in?  \nHe showed her his key, which was attached  to a piece of wood with a red six drawn on \nit. \nThat's odd, she said. Six.  \nWhat's so odd about that? he asked. \nShe had suddenly recalled t hat the house where they had lived in Prague before her \nparents were divorced was number six. But she answered something else (which we \nmay credit to her wiles): You're in room six and my shift ends at six.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 25\nWell, my train leaves at seven, said the stranger. \nShe did not know how to respond, so she gave him the bill for his signature and took it \nover to the reception desk. When she finis hed work, the stranger was no longer at his \ntable. Had he understood her di screet message? She left the re staurant in a state of \nexcitement. \nOpposite the hotel was a barren little park, as wretched as onl y the park of a dirty little \ntown can be, but for Tereza it had always been an island of beauty: it had grass, four \npoplars, benches, a weeping willow, and a few forsythia bushes. \nHe was sitting on a yellow bench that afforded a clear view of the restaurant entrance. \nThe very same bench she had sat on the day before with a book in her lap! She knew \nthen (the birds of fortuity had begun alighting on her shoulders) that this stranger was \nher fate. He called out to her, invited her to sit next to him. (The crew other soul rushed \nup to the deck other body.) Th en she walked him to the st ation, and he gave her his \ncard as a farewell gesture. If ever you should happen to come to Prague...  \nMuch more than the card he sl ipped her at the last  minute, it was the call of all those \nfortuities (the book, Beethoven, the number si x, the yellow park benc h) which gave her \nthe courage to leave home and change her fate . It may well be those few fortuities \n(quite modest, by the way, even drab, just what one would expect from so lackluster a \ntown) which set her love in motion and provided her with a source of energy she had \nnot yet exhausted at the end of her days. \nOur day-to-day life is bombarded with fortuities or, to be more precise, with the \naccidental meetings of people and events we  call coincidences. Co-incidence means \nthat two events unexpectedl y happen at the same time, they meet: Tomas appears in \nthe hotel restaurant at the same time the radio is playing Beethoven. We do not even \nnotice the great majority of such coincide nces. If the seat Tomas occupied had been \noccupied instead by the local butcher, Tere za never would have noticed that the radio \nwas playing Beethoven (though the meeting of Beethoven and the butcher would also \nhave been an interesting coincidence). But her  nascent love inflamed her sense of \nbeauty, and she would never for get that music. Whenever she heard it, she would be \ntouched. Everything going on around her at that moment would be haloed by the music \nand take on its beauty. \nEarly in the novel that Tereza clutched und er her arm when she went to visit Tomas, \nAnna meets Vronsky in curious circumstances : they are at the railway station when \nsomeone is run over by a train. At the end  of the novel, Anna throws herself under a \ntrain. This symmetrical co mposition—the same motif appears at the beginning and at \nthe end—may seem quite novelistic to you,  and I am willing to agree, but only on \ncondition that you refrain from reading such notions as fictive, fabricated, and untrue to \nlife into the word novelistic. Because human lives are composed in precisely such a \nfashion. \nThey are composed like music. Guided by his sense of beauty, an individual transforms \na fortuitous occurrence (Beethoven's music,  death under a train) into a motif, which\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 26\nthen assumes a permanent place in the composit ion of the individual's life. Anna could \nhave chosen another way to take her life. But the motif of death and the railway station, \nunforgettably bound to the birth of love, enticed her in her hour of despair with its dark \nbeauty. Without realizing it, the individual co mposes his life according to the laws of \nbeauty even in times of greatest distress. \nIt is wrong, then, to chide the novel for be ing fascinated by mysterious coincidences \n(like the meeting of Anna, Vr onsky, the railway station, and death or the meeting of \nBeethoven, Tomas, Tereza, and the cognac), but it is right to chide man for being blind \nto such coincidences in his daily life. For he  thereby deprives his life of a dimension of \nbeauty. \nImpelled by the birds of fortuity fluttering down on her shoulders, she took a week's \nleave and, without a word to her mother , boarded the train to  Prague. During the \njourney, she made frequent trips to the toilet to  look in the mirror and beg her soul not \nto abandon the deck of her body for a moment on this most crucial day of her life. \nScrutinizing herself on one such trip, she h ad a sudden scare: she felt a scratch in her \nthroat. Could she be coming down with something on this most crucial day of her life? \nBut there was no turning back. So she phoned him from the station, and the moment he \nopened the door, her stomach started rumbling te rribly. She was mortif ied. She felt as \nthough she were carrying her mother in her  stomach and her mother had guffawed to \nspoil her meeting with Tomas. \nFor the first few seconds, she was afraid he would throw her out because of the crude \nnoises she was making, but then he put his arms around her. She was grateful to him \nfor ignoring her rumbles, and kissed him passionat ely, her eyes misting. Before the first \nminute was up, they were making love. She screamed while maki ng love. She had a \nfever by then. She had come down with t he flu. The nozzle of the hose supplying \noxygen to the lungs was stuffed and red. \nWhen she traveled to Prague a second time, it was with a heavy suitcase. She had \npacked all her things, determined never again to return to the small town. He had \ninvited her to come to his place the following evening. That night, she had slept in a \ncheap hotel. In the morning, she carried her heavy suitcase to the station, left it there, \nand roamed the streets of Prague the whole day with Anna Karenina under her arm. \nNot even after she rang the doorbell and he  opened the door would she part with it. It \nwas like a ticket into Tomas' s world. She realized that  she had nothing but that \nmiserable ticket, and the thought brought her nearly to tears. To keep from crying, she \ntalked too much and too loudly, and she laughed.  And again he took her in his arms \nalmost at once and they made love. She had entered a mist in which nothing could be \nseen and only her scream could be heard. \nIt was no sigh, no moan; it was a real scr eam. She screamed so hard that Tomas had \nto turn his head away from her face, afraid that her voice so close to his ear would \nrupture his eardrum. The scream was not an expression of s ensuality. Sensuality is the \ntotal mobilization of the senses: an individual observes his partner in tently, straining to \ncatch every sound. But her scream aimed at crippling the senses, preventing all seeing\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 27\nand hearing. What was screaming in fact was the naive idealism of her love trying to \nbanish all contradictions, banish the duality of body and soul, banish perhaps even \ntime. \nWere her eyes closed? No, but they were not looking anywhere. She kept them fixed \non the void of the ceiling. At times she twisted her head violently from side to side. \nWhen the scream died down, she fell asleep at his side, clutching his hand. She held \nhis hand all night. \nEven at the age of eight she would fall asleep by pressing one hand into the other and \nmaking believe she was holding  the hand of the m an whom she loved, the man of her \nlife. So if in her sleep she pressed Tomas's hand with such tenacity, we can understand \nwhy: she had been training for it since childhood. \nA young woman forced to keep drunks suppl ied with beer and siblings with clean \nunderwear—instead of being allowed to purs ue something higher —stores up great \nreserves of vitality, a vitality never dreamed of by university students yawning over their \nbooks. Tereza had read a good deal more than they, and learne d a good deal more \nabout life, but she would nev er realize it. The difference between the university \ngraduate and the autodidac t lies not so much in the extent of knowledge as in the \nextent of vitality and self-confidence. The el an with which Tereza flung herself into her \nnew Prague existence was both frenzied and precarious. She seemed to be expecting \nsomeone to come up to her any day and say, What are you doing here? Go back where \nyou belong! All her eagerness for life hung by a thread: Tomas's voice. For it was \nTomas's voice that had once coaxed forth her timorous soul from its hiding place in her \nbowels. \nTereza had a job in a darkr oom, but it was not enough for her. She wanted to take \npictures, not develop them. Tomas's friend Sabi na lent her three or four monographs of \nfamous photographers, then invi ted her to a cafe and explained over the open books \nwhat made each of the pictures interesti ng. Tereza listened with silent concentration, \nthe kind few professors ever glimpse on their students' faces. \nThanks to Sabina, she came to understand the ties between photography and painting, \nand she made Tomas take her to every exhibi t that opened in Prague. Before long, she \nwas placing her own pictures in the illustrated weekly where she worked, and finally she \nleft the darkroom for the staff of professional photographers. \nOn the evening of that day, s he and Tomas went out to a bar  with friends to celebrate \nher promotion. Everyone danced. Tomas began to mope. Back at home, after some \nprodding from Tereza, he admitted that he h ad been jealous watching her dance with a \ncolleague of his. \nYou mean you were really j ealous? she asked him ten times or more, incredulously, as \nthough someone had just informed her she had been awarded a Nobel Prize.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 28\nThen she put her arm around his waist and began dancing across the room. The step \nshe used was not the one she had shown off in the bar. It was more like a village polka, \na wild romp that sent her l egs flying in the air and her torso bouncing all over the room, \nwith Tomas in tow. \nBefore long, unfortunately, she began to be jealous herself, and Tomas saw her \njealousy not as a Nobel Prize, but as a burden, a burden he would be saddled with until \nnot long before his death. \nWhile she marched around the pool naked wit h a large group of other naked women, \nTomas stood over them in a basket hanging fr om the pool's arched roof, shouting at \nthem, making them sing and do kneebends. The moment one of them did a faulty \nkneebend, he would shoot her. \nLet me return to this dream. Its horror did not begin with Tomas's first pistol shot; it was \nhorrifying from the outset. Marching naked in formation with a group of naked women \nwas for Tereza the quintessential image of horror. When she lived at home, her mother \nforbade her to lock the bathroom door. What she meant by her injunction was: Your \nbody is just like all other bodies; you have no right to shame; you have no reason to \nhide something that exists in  millions of identical copies . In her mother's world all \nbodies were the same and marched behind one another in formation. Since childhood, \nTereza had seen nudity as a sign of concentration camp uniformity, a sign of \nhumiliation. \nThere was yet another horror at the very begi nning of the dream: a ll the women had to \nsing! Not only were their bodie s identical, identically worthl ess, not only were their \nbodies mere resounding soulless mechanisms—the women rejoiced over it! Theirs was \nthe joyful solidarity of  the soulless. The women were pl eased at having thrown off the \nballast of the soul—that laughable conceit, that illusion of uniqueness—to become one \nlike the next. Tereza sang with them, but di d not rejoice. She sang because she was \nafraid that if she did not sing the women would kill her. \nBut what was the meaning of the fact that Tomas shot at them, toppling one after \nanother into the pool, dead? \nThe women, overjoyed by their sameness, their lack of diversity, were, in fact, \ncelebrating their imminent demise, which would render their sameness absolute. So \nTomas's shots were merely the joyful climax to their morbid march. After every report of \nhis pistol, they burst into joyous laug hter, and as each corpse sank beneath the \nsurface, they sang even louder. \nBut why was Tomas the one doing the shooting? And why was he out to shoot Tereza \nwith the rest of them? \nBecause he was the one who sent Tereza to join them. That was what the dream was \nmeant to tell Tomas, what Tereza was unabl e to tell him herself. She had come to him \nto escape her mother's world, a world wher e all bodies were equal. She had come to \nhim to make her body unique, irreplaceable. But he, too, had drawn an equal sign \nbetween her and the rest of them : he kissed them all alike, stroked them alike, made\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 29\nno, absolutely no distinction between Tereza 's body and the other bodies. He had sent \nher back into the world she tried to esc ape, sent her to march naked with the other \nnaked women. \nShe would dream three series of dreams in succession: the first was of cats going \nberserk and referred to the sufferings she had gone through in her lifetime; the second \nwas images of her execution an d came in countless variations ; the third was of her life \nafter death, when humiliation turned into a never-ending state. \nThe dreams left nothing to be deciphered. The accusation they leveled at Tomas was \nso clear that his only reaction was to hang his head and stro ke her hand without a \nword. \nThe dreams were eloquent, but they were al so beautiful. That aspect seems to have \nescaped Freud in his theory of dreams. Dreaming is not merely an act of \ncommunication (or coded communication, if you lik e); it is also an aesthetic activity, a \ngame of the imagination,  a game that is a value in it self. Our dreams prove that to \nimagine—to dream about things that have not happened—is among mankind's deepest \nneeds. Herein lies the danger. If dreams were  not beautiful, they would quickly be \nforgotten. But Tereza kept coming back to her dreams, running through them in her \nmind, turning them into legends. Tomas lived under the hypnotic spell cast by the ex-\ncruciating beauty of Tereza's dreams. \nDear Tereza, sweet Tereza, what am I losing you to? he once said to her as they sat \nface to face in a wine cellar. Every night you dream of death as if  you really wished to \nquit this world. . . .  \nIt was day; reason and will power were back in  place. A drop of red wine ran slowly \ndown her glass as she answered. There's nothing I can do about it, Tomas. Oh, I \nunderstand. I know you love me. I know your infidelities are no great tragedy ...  \nShe looked at him with love in her eyes , but she feared the night ahead, feared her \ndreams. Her life was split. Both day and night were competing for her. \nAnyone whose goal is somethin g higher must expect some day to suffer vertigo. What \nis vertigo? Fear of falling? Then why do we  feel it even when the observation tower \ncomes equipped with a sturdy handrail? No, vert igo is something other than the fear of \nfalling. It is the voice of the emptiness below us which tempts and lures us, it is the \ndesire to fall, against which, terrified, we defend ourselves. \nThe naked women marching around the swi mming pool, the corpses in the hearse \nrejoicing that she, too, was dead— these were the down below she had feared and fled \nonce before but which mysteriously beckoned her. These were her vertigo: she heard a \nsweet (almost joyous) summons to renounce her fate and soul. The solidarity of the \nsoulless calling her. And in times of weakness, she was ready to heed the call and \nreturn to her mother. She was ready to dism iss the crew of her soul from the deck of \nher body; ready to descend to a place among her mother's friends and laugh when one \nof them broke wind noisily; ready to march around the pool naked with them and sing."

    "raw_text": "\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 30\nTrue, Tereza fought with her mo ther until the day she left hom e, but let us not forget \nthat she never stopped loving her. She would have done anyth ing for her if her mother \nhad asked in a loving voice. The only reason she found the strength to leave was that \nshe never heard that voice. \nWhen Tereza's mother realized that her aggr essiveness no longer had any power over \nher daughter, she started writing her querulous letters, complaining about her husband, \nher boss, her health, her children, and assuri ng Tereza she was the only person left in \nher life. Tereza thought that at last, after twenty years, she was hearing the voice of her \nmother's love, and felt like going back. All the more because she felt so weak, so debil-\nitated by Tomas's infidelities. They exposed  her powerlessness, which in turn led to \nvertigo, the insuperable longing to fall. \nOne day her mother phoned to say she had canc er and only a few months to live. The \nnews transformed into rebellion Tereza's despair at Tomas's infidelities. She had \nbetrayed her mother, she told herself reproachfully, and for a man who did not love her. \nShe was willing to forget everything her mother had done to torture her. She was in a \nposition to understand her now; they were in the same situat ion: her mother loved her \nstepfather just as Tereza lo ved Tomas, and her stepfather to rtured her mother with his \ninfidelities just as Tomas galled her with his. The cause of her mother's malice was that \nshe had suffered so. \nTereza told Tomas that her mother was ill and that she would be taking a week off to go \nand see her. Her voice was full of spite. \nSensing that the real reas on calling her back to her mo ther was vertigo, Tomas \nopposed the trip. He rang up the hospital in t he small town. Meticulous records of the \nincidence of cancer were kept throughout t he country, so he had no trouble finding out \nthat Tereza's mother had never been sus pected of having the disease nor had she \neven seen a doctor for over a year. \nTereza obeyed Tomas and did not go to visi t her mother. Several hours after the \ndecision she fell in the street  and injured her knee. She began to teeter as she walked, \nfell almost daily, bumped into things or, at the very least, dropped objects. \nShe was in the grip of an insuperable longing to fall. She lived in a constant state of \nvertigo. \nPick me up, is the message of  a person who keeps falling. Tomas kept picking her up, \npatiently. \nI want to make love to you in my studi o. It will be like a stage surrounded by people. \nThe audience won't be allowed up close, but they won't be able to take their eyes off \nus....  \nAs time passed, the image lost some of its original cruelty and began to excite Tereza. \nShe would whisper the details to him while they made love.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 31\nThen it occurred to her that there might be a way to avoid the condemnation she saw in \nTomas's infidelities: all he had to do was take her along, take her with him when he \nwent to see his mistresses! Maybe then her body would again become the first and only \namong all others. Her body would become his second, his assistant, his alter ego. \nI'll undress them for you, give them a bath, bring them in to you ... she would whisper to \nhim as they pressed together. She yearned for the two of them  to merge into a \nhermaphrodite. Then the other women's bodies would be their playthings. \nOh, to be the alter ego of his polygamous life! Tomas refused to understand, but she \ncould not get it out of her head, and tried to cultivate her friendship with Sabina. Tereza \nbegan by offering to do a series of photographs of Sabina. \nSabina invited Tereza to her studio, and at last she saw the spacious room and its \ncenterpiece: the large, square, platform-like bed. \nI feel awful that you've never been here be fore, said Sabina, as she showed her the \npictures leaning against  the wall. She even pulled out an old canvas, of a steelworks \nunder construction, which she had done during her school days, a period when the \nstrictest realism had been required of all students (art that was not realistic was said to \nsap the foundations of socialism). In the spirit of the wager of the times, she had tried to \nbe stricter than her teachers and had painted in a style c oncealing the brush strokes \nand closely resembling color photography. \nHere is a painting I happened to drip red paint on.  At first I was terribly upset, but then I \nstarted enjoying it. The trickl e looked like a crack; it turned the building site into a \nbattered old backdrop, a backdrop with a building site painted on it. I began playing with \nthe crack, filling it out, wonder ing what might be visible behind it. And that's how I \nbegan my first cycle of paintings. I called it Behind the Scenes. Of course, I couldn't \nshow them to anybody. I'd have been kicked out  of the Academy. On the surface, there \nwas always an impeccably realistic world, but underneath, behind the backdrop's \ncracked canvas, lurked something different, something mysterious or abstract.  \nAfter pausing for a moment, she added, On the surface, an intelligible lie; underneath, \nthe unintelligible truth.  \nTereza listened to her with the remarkable c oncentration that few professors ever see \non the face of a student and began to perceiv e that all Sabina's paintings, past and \npresent, did indeed treat the same idea, that  they all featured the confluence of two \nthemes, two worlds, that they were all double exposures, so to speak. A landscape \nshowing an old-fashioned table lamp shining th rough it. An idyllic still life of apples, \nnuts, and a tiny, candle-lit Christmas tree showing a hand ripping through the canvas. \nShe felt a rush of admirati on for Sabina, and because Sabina treated her as a friend it \nwas an admiration free of fear and suspicion and quickly turned into friendship. \nShe nearly forgot she had come to take photographs. Sabina had to remind her. Tereza \nfinally looked away from the pai ntings only to see the bed set in the middle of the room \nlike a platform.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 32\nNext to the bed stood a small table, and on the table the model of a human head, the \nkind hairdressers put wigs on.  Sabina's wig stand sported a bowler hat rather than a \nwig. It used to belong to my grandfather, she said with a smile. \nIt was the kind of hat—black,  hard, round—that Tereza had seen only on the screen, \nthe kind of hat Chaplin wore. She smiled back,  picked it up, and after studying it for a \ntime, said, Would you like me to take your picture in it?  \nSabina laughed for a long time at the idea. Tereza put down the bowler hat, picked up \nher camera, and started taking pictures. \nWhen she had been at it for almost an hour, s he suddenly said, What would you say to \nsome nude shots?  \nNude shots? Sabina laughed. \nYes, said Tereza, repeating her proposal more boldly, nude shots.  \nThat calls for a drink, said Sabina, and opened a bottle of wine. \nTereza felt her body going weak; she wa s suddenly tongue-tied. Sabina, meanwhile, \nstrode back and forth, wine in  hand, going on ab out her grandfather, who'd been the \nmayor of a small town; Sabina had never k nown him; all he'd left behind was this \nbowler hat and a picture showing a raised pla tform with several small-town dignitaries \non it; one of them was Grandfather ; it wasn't at all clear what they were doing up there \non the platform; maybe they were officiatin g at some ceremony, unveiling a monument \nto a fellow dignitary who had also once worn a bowler hat at public ceremonies. \nSabina went on and on about the bowler hat and her grandfather until, emptying her \nthird glass, she said I'll be right back and disappeared into the bathroom. \nShe came out in her bathrobe.  Tereza picked up her camera and put it to her eye. \nSabina threw open the robe. \nThe camera served Tereza as both a me chanical eye through which to observe \nTomas's mistress and a veil by which to conceal her face from her. \nIt took Sabina some time before she could bring herself to slip  out of the robe entirely. \nThe situation she found herself  in was proving a bit more  difficult than she had \nexpected. After several minutes of posing, she went up to Tereza and said, Now it's my \nturn to take your picture. Strip!  \nSabina had heard the command Strip! so many times from Tomas that it was engraved \nin her memory. Thus, Tomas's mistress had just given Tomas's command to Tomas's \nwife. The two women were joined by the same magic word . That was Tomas's way of \nunexpectedly turning an innocent conversation with a woman into an erotic situation. \nInstead of stroking, flattering, pleading, he would issue a command, issue it abruptly, \nunexpectedly, softly yet firmly and authoritatively, and at a distance: at such moments \nhe never touched the woman he was addressing. He often used it on Tereza as well,\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 33\nand even though he said it softly, even though he whispered it, it was a command, and \nobeying never failed to arouse her. Hearing the word now made her desire to obey \neven stronger, because doing a stranger's bidding is a s pecial madness, a madness all \nthe more heady in this case because the command came not from a man but from a \nwoman. \nSabina took the camera from her, and Tere za took off her clothes. There she stood \nbefore Sabina naked and disarmed. Literally disarmed: deprived of the apparatus she \nhad been using to cover her face and aim at Sabina like a weapon. She was completely \nat the mercy of Tomas's mistress. This beautiful submission intoxicated Tereza. She \nwished that the moments she stood naked opposite Sabina would never end. \nI think that Sabina, too, felt  the strange enchantm ent of the situation: her lover's wife \nstanding oddly compliant and timorous before her. But after clicking the shutter two or \nthree times, almost frightened by the enchant ment and eager to dispel it, she burst into \nloud laughter. \nTereza followed suit, and the two of them got dressed. \nAll previous crimes of the Russian empi re had been committed under the cover of a \ndiscreet shadow. The deportation of a million Lithuanians, the murder of hundreds of \nthousands of Poles, the liquidation of the Crimean Tatars remain in our memory, but no \nphotographic documentation exists; sooner or later they will therefore be proclaimed as \nfabrications. Not so the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia, of which both stills and \nmotion pictures are stored in archives throughout the world. \nCzech photographers and cameramen were acutely aware that they were the ones who \ncould best do the only thing left to do: pres erve the face of violence for the distant \nfuture. Seven days in a row, Tereza roamed the streets, photographing Russian \nsoldiers and officers in compromising situations. The Russians did not know what to do. \nThey had been carefully briefed about how to behave if som eone fired at them or threw \nstones, but they had received no directives  about what to do when someone aimed a \nlens. \nShe shot roll after roll and gave about half of them, undeveloped, to foreign journalists \n(the borders were still open, and reporters passing through were grateful for any kind of \ndocument). Many of her phot ographs turned up in the Western press. They were \npictures of tanks, of threat ening fists, of houses destroyed, of corpses covered with \nbloodstained red-white-and-blue Czech flags, of young men on motorcycles racing full \nspeed around the tanks and waving Czech flags  on long staffs, of young girls in \nunbelievably short skirts provoking the miserable sexually famished Russian soldiers by \nkissing random passersby before their eyes. As I have said, the Russian invasion was \nnot only a tragedy; it was a carnival of hate filled with a curi ous (and no longer \nexplicable) euphoria. \nShe took some fifty prints with her to Swit zerland, prints she ha d made herself with all \nthe care and skill she could muster. She offe red them to a high-circulation illustrated \nmagazine. The editor gave her a kind recepti on (all Czechs still wore the halo of their \nmisfortune, and the good Swiss were touched) ; he offered her a seat, looked through\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 34\nthe prints, praised them, and explained that  because a certain time had elapsed since \nthe events, they hadn't the slightest chance ( not that they aren't very beautiful! ) of \nbeing published. \nBut it's not over yet in Prague! she protested, and tried to explai n to him in her bad \nGerman that at this very moment, even wit h the country occupied, with everything \nagainst them, workers' councils were forming in the factories, t he students were going \nout on strike demanding the departure of the Russians, and the whole country was \nsaying aloud what it  thought. That's what's so unbe lievable! And nobody here cares \nanymore.  \nThe editor was glad when an energetic woman ca me into the office and interrupted the \nconversation. The woman handed him a folder  and said, Here's the nudist beach \narticle.  \nThe editor was delicate enough to fear that a Czech who photographed tanks would \nfind pictures of naked people on a beach frivolou s. He laid the fol der at the far end of \nthe desk and quickly said to the woman, How would you like to meet a Czech colleague \nof yours? She's brought me some marvelous pictures.  \nThe woman shook Tereza's hand and picked up her photographs. Have a look at mine \nin the meantime, she said. \nTereza leaned over to the folder and took out the pictures. \nAlmost apologetically the editor said to Tere za, Of course they're completely different \nfrom your pictures.  \nNot at all, said Tereza. They're the same.  \nNeither the editor nor the photographer understood her, and ev en I find it difficult to \nexplain what she had in mind when she compared a nude beach to the Russian \ninvasion. Looking through the pictures, sh e stopped for a time at one that showed a \nfamily of four standing in a circle: a naked mother leaning over her  children, her giant \ntits hanging low like a goat's or cow's, an d the husband leaning the same way on the \nother side, his penis and scrotum looking very much like an udder in miniature. \nYou don't like them, do you? asked the editor. \nThey're good photographs.  \nShe's shocked by the subject matter, said the woman. I can tell just by looking at you \nthat you've never set foot on a nude beach.  \nNo, said Tereza. \nThe editor smiled. You see how easy it is to guess where you're from? The Communist \ncountries are awfully puritanical.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 35\nThere's nothing wrong with the naked body, the woman said with maternal affection. It's \nnormal. And everything normal is beautiful!  \nThe image of her mother marching through the flat naked flashed through Tereza's \nmind. She could still hear t he laughter behind her back w hen she ran and pulled the \ncurtains to stop the neighbors from seeing her naked mother. \nThe woman photographer invited Tereza to the magazine's cafeteria for a cup of coffee. \nThose pictures of yours, they're very intere sting. I couldn't help noticing what a terrific \nsense of the female body you have. You know what I mean. The girls with the \nprovocative poses!  \nThe ones kissing passersby in front of the Russian tanks?  \nYes. You'd be a top-notch fashion photographer, you know? You'd have to get yourself \na model first, someone like you who's look ing for a break. Then you could make a \nportfolio of photographs and show them to the agencies. It would take some time before \nyou made a name for yourself, naturally, bu t I can do one thing for you here and now: \nintroduce you to the editor in charge of our  garden section. He mi ght need some shots \nof cactuses and roses and things.  \nThank you very much, Tereza said sincer ely, because it was clear that the woman \nsitting opposite her was full of good will. \nBut then she said to herself, Why take pictures of cactuses? She had no desire to go \nthrough in Zurich what she'd been through in Prague: battles over job and career, over \nevery picture published. She had never been ambitious out of vanity. All she had ever \nwanted was to escape from her mother's world. Yes, she saw it with absolute clarity: no \nmatter how enthusiastic she was about taking pictures, she could just as easily have \nturned her enthusiasm to any other endeavor . Photography was nothing but a way of \ngetting at something higher and living beside Tomas. \nShe said, My husband is a doctor. He can support me. I don't need to take pictures.  \nThe woman photographer r eplied, I don't see how you can gi ve it up after the beautiful \nwork you've done.  \nYes, the pictures of the invasion were something else again. She had not done them for \nTomas. She had done them out of passion. But not pa ssion for photography. She had \ndone them out of passionate hatred. The si tuation would never recur. And these \nphotographs, which she had m ade out of passion, were the ones nobody wanted \nbecause they were out of date. Only ca ctuses had perennial appea l. And cactuses \nwere of no interest to her. \nShe said, You're too kind, really, but I'd rather stay at home. I don't need a job.  \nThe woman said, But will you be fulfilled sitting at home?  \nTereza said, More fulfilled than by taking pictures of cactuses.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 36\nThe woman said, Even if you take pi ctures of cactuses, you're leading your life. If you \nlive only for your husband, you have no life of your own.  \nAll of a sudden Tereza felt annoyed: My husband is my life, not cactuses.  \nThe woman photographer responded in kind: You mean you think of yourself as happy?  \nTereza, still annoyed, said, Of course I'm happy!  \nThe woman said, The only kind of woman w ho can say that is very ... She stopped \nshort. \nTereza finished it for her: ... limited. That's what you mean, isn't it?  \nThe woman regained control of herself and said, Not limited. Anachronistic.  \nYou're right, said Tereza wistfully. That's just what my husband says about me.  \nBut Tomas spent days on end at the hospital, and she was at home alone. At least she \nhad Karenin and could take him on long wal ks! Home again, she would pore over her \nGerman and French grammars. But she felt  sad and had trouble concentrating. She \nkept coming back to the speech Dubcek had gi ven over the radio after his return from \nMoscow. Although she had completely forgott en what he said, she could still hear his \nquavering voice. She thought about how foreign soldiers had arrested him, the head of \nan independent state, in his own country, hel d him for four days somewhere in the \nUkrainian mountains, informed him he was to  be executed—as, a decade before, they \nhad executed his Hungarian counterpart Im re Nagy—then packed him off to Moscow, \nordered him to have a bath and shave, to c hange his clothes and put on a tie, apprised \nhim of the decision to commute his execution,  instructed him to consider himself head \nof state once more, sat him at a table opposite Brezhnev, and forced him to act. \nHe returned, humiliated, to address his hum iliated nation. He was so humiliated he \ncould not even speak. Tereza would never forget those awful pauses  in the middle of \nhis sentences. Was he that exhausted? 111? Had they drugg ed him? Or was it only \ndespair? If nothing was to remain of Dubc ek, then at least those awful long pauses \nwhen he seemed unable to brea the, when he gasped for air before a whole nation \nglued to its radios, at least those pauses wo uld remain. Those pauses contained all the \nhorror that had befallen their country. \nIt was the seventh day of the invasion. She heard the speech in the editorial offices of a \nnewspaper that had been transformed overnight into an organ of the resistance. Every-\none present hated Dubcek at that moment. They reproached him for compromising; \nthey felt humiliated by his humiliation; his weakness offended them. \nThinking in Zurich of those days, she no longer  felt any aversion to the man. The word \nweak no longer sounded like a verdict. Any man confronted with superior strength is \nweak, even if he has an athletic body like Dubcek's. The very weakness that at the time \nhad seemed unbearable and repulsive, the w eakness that had driven Tereza and \nTomas from the country, suddenly attracted her. She realized that she belonged among\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 37\nthe weak, in the camp of the weak, in the country of the weak, and that she had to be \nfaithful to them precisely because they were  weak and gasped for breath in the middle \nof sentences. \nShe felt attracted by their weakness as by ve rtigo. She felt attracted by it because she \nfelt weak herself. Again she began to feel  jealous and again her hands shook. When \nTomas noticed it, he did what he usually did: he took her hands in hi s and tried to calm \nthem by pressing hard. She tore them away from him. \nWhat's the matter? he asked. \nNothing.  \nWhat do you want me to do for you?  \nI want you to be old. Ten years older. Twenty years older!  \nWhat she meant was: I want you to be weak. As weak as I am. \nKarenin was not overjoyed by the move to Switzerland. Ka renin hated change. Dog \ntime cannot be plotted along a straight line; it does not move on and on, from one thing \nto the next. It moves in a circle like the hands of a clock, which—they, too, unwilling to \ndash madly ahead—turn round and round the face , day in and day out following the \nsame path. In Prague, when Tomas and Tereza bought a new chair or moved a flower \npot, Karenin would look on in displeasure. It disturbed hi s sense of time. It was as \nthough they were trying to dupe  the hands of the clock by  changing the numbers on its \nface. \nNonetheless, he soon managed to reestablish the old order and old rituals in the Zurich \nflat. As in Prague, he would jump up on their bed and welcome them to the day, \naccompany Tereza on her morning shopping  jaunt, and make certain he got the other \nwalks coming to him as well. \nHe was the timepiece of their lives. In peri ods of despair, she would remind herself she \nhad to hold on because of him, because he was weaker than she,  weaker perhaps \neven than Dubcek and their abandoned homeland. \nOne day when they came back from a walk, the phone was ringing. She picked up the \nreceiver and asked who it was. \nIt was a woman's voice speaking German and a sking for Tomas. It was an impatient \nvoice, and Tereza felt there was a hint of  derision in it. When she said that Tomas \nwasn't there and she didn't know when he'd be back, the woman on the other end of the \nline started laughing and, without saying goodbye, hung up. \nTereza knew it did not mean a thing. It c ould have been a nurse fr om the hospital, a \npatient, a secretary, anyone.  But still she was upset and unable to concentrate on \nanything. It was then that she realized she had lost the la st bit of strength she had had \nat home: she was absolutely incapable of tolerating this absolutely insignificant incident.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 38\nBeing in a foreign country means walking a tightrope high above t he ground without the \nnet afforded a person by the country wher e he has his family, colleagues, and friends, \nand where he can easily say what he has to  say in a language he has known from \nchildhood. In Prague she was d ependent on Tomas only when it  came to the heart; \nhere she was dependent on him for everything. What would happen to her here if he \nabandoned her? Would she have to live her whole life in fear of losing him? \nShe told herself: Their acquaintance had b een based on an error from the start. The \ncopy of Anna Karenina  under her arm amounted to false papers; it had given Tomas \nthe wrong idea. In spite of t heir love, they had made each other's life a hell. The fact \nthat they loved each other was merely proof that the fault la y not in themselves, in their \nbehavior or inconstancy of feeling, but rather in their inco mpatibility: he was strong and \nshe was weak. She was like Dubcek, who made a thirty-second pause in the middle of \na sentence; she was like her country, whic h stuttered, gasped for breath, could not \nspeak. \nBut when the strong were too weak to hurt the weak, the weak had to be strong enough \nto leave. \nAnd having told herself all this, she pressed her face against Karenin's furry head and \nsaid, Sorry, Karenin. It looks as though you're going to have to move again.  \nSitting crushed into a corner of the train compartment with her heavy suitcase above \nher head and Karenin squeezed against her legs , she kept thinking about the cook at \nthe hotel restaurant where s he had worked when she lived with her mother. The cook \nwould take every opportunity to give her a sl ap on the behind, and never tired of asking \nher in front of everyone when she would give in and go to bed with him. It was odd that \nhe was the one who came to mind. He  had always been the prime example of \neverything she loathed. And now all she c ould think of was looking him up and telling \nhim, You used to say you wanted to sleep with me. Well, here I am.  \nShe longed to do something that would prev ent her from turning back to Tomas. She \nlonged to destroy brutally the past seven y ears of her life. It wa s vertigo. A heady, \ninsuperable longing to fall. \nWe might also call vertigo the intoxication  of the weak. Aware of  his weakness, a man \ndecides to give in rather than stand up to it. He is drunk  with weakness, wishes to grow \neven weaker, wishes to fall down in the middle of the main square in front of everybody, \nwishes to be down, lower than down. \nShe tried to talk herself into settling outside of Prague and giving up her profession as a \nphotographer. She would go back to the small town fr om which Tomas's voice had \nonce lured her. \nBut once in Prague, she found she had to spend some time taking care of various \npractical matters, and began putting off her departure."

Ka renin jumped all over him, so it was a \nwhile before they had to make any overtures to each other. \nThey felt they were standing on a snow-covered plain, shivering with cold. \nThen they moved together like lovers who had never kissed before. \nHas everything been all right? he asked. \nYes, she answered. \nHave you been to the magazine?  \nI've given them a call.  \nWell?  \nNothing yet. I've been waiting.  \nFor what?  \nShe made no response. She could not tell him that she had been waiting for him. \nNow we return to a moment we already  know about. Tomas was desperately unhappy \nand had a bad stomachache. He did not fall asleep until very late at night. \nSoon thereafter Tereza awoke. (There were  Russian airplanes circling over Prague, \nand it was impossible to sleep for the noise.)  Her first thought wa s that he had come \nback because of her; because of her, he had changed his destiny. Now he would no \nlonger be responsible for her; now she was responsible for him. \nThe responsibility, she felt, seemed to require more strength than she could muster. \nBut all at once she recalled that just before he had appeared at the door of their flat the \nday before, the church bells had chimed six o'clock. On the day  they first met, her shift \nhad ended at six. She saw him sitting there in front of  her on the yellow bench and \nheard the bells in the belfry chime six. \nNo, it was not superstition, it was a sense of beauty that cured her of her depression \nand imbued her with a new will to live. The birds of fortuity had alighted once more on \nher shoulders. There were t ears in her eyes, and she was unutterably happy to hear \nhim breathing at her side. \n \nPART THREE \nWords Misunderstood \nGeneva is a city of fountains large and small, of parks wher e music once rang out from \nthe bandstands. Even the university is hidd en among trees. Franz had just finished his \nafternoon lecture. As he left the building, the sprinklers were spouting jets of water over"

    "raw_text": "\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 40\nthe lawn and he was in a capital mood. He  was on his way to see his mistress. She \nlived only a few streets away. \nHe often stopped in for a visit, but only as a friend, never as a lover. If he made love to \nher in her Geneva studio, he would be going from one woman to the other, from wife to \nmistress and back in a single day, and because in Geneva husband and wife sleep \ntogether in the French style, in the same bed, he would be going from the bed of one \nwoman to the bed of another in  the space of several hours.  And that, he felt, would \nhumiliate both mistress and wife and, in the end, himself as well. \nThe love he bore this woman, with whom he  had fallen in love several months before, \nwas so precious to him that he tried to cr eate an independent space for her in his life, a \nrestricted zone of purity. He was often invited to lecture at foreign universities, and now \nhe accepted all offers. But because they were not enough to satisfy his new-found \nwanderlust, he took to inventing congresses and symposia as a means of justifying the \nnew absences to his wife. His mistress, w ho had a flexible schedule, accompanied him \non all speaking engagements, real  and imagined. So it was that within a short span of \ntime he introduced her to many European cities and an American one. \nHow would you like to go to Palermo ten days from now? asked Franz. \nI prefer Geneva, she answer ed. She was standing in front of her easel examining a \nwork in progress. \nHow can you live without seeing Palermo? asked Franz in an attempt at levity. \nI have seen Palermo, she said. \nYou have? he said with a hint of jealousy. \nA friend of mine once sent me a postcard from  there. It's taped up over the toilet. \nHaven't you noticed?  \nThen she told him a story. Once upon a time, in the early part of the century, there lived \na poet. He was so old he had to be taken on walks by his amanuensis. 'Master,' his \namanuensis said one day, 'look what's up in the sky! It's the first airplane ever to fly \nover the city!' 'I have my own picture of it,' said the poet to his amanuensis, without \nraising his eyes from the ground. Well, I have my own picture of Palermo. It has the \nsame hotels and cars as all cities. And my studio always has new and different pictures.  \nFranz was sad. He had grown so  accustomed to linking their love life to foreign travel \nthat his Let's go to Palermo! was an unambi guous erotic message and her I prefer \nGeneva could have only one meaning: his mistress no longer desired him. \nHow could he be so unsure of himself with her? She had not given him the slightest \ncause for worry! In fact, she was the one who had  taken the erotic initiative shortly after \nthey met. He was a good-looking man; he was at the peak of his scholarly career; he \nwas even feared by his colleagues for t he arrogance and tenacity he displayed during \nprofessional meetings and colloquia. Then why did he worry daily that his mistress was \nabout to leave him?\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 41\nThe only explanation I can suggest is that for Franz, love was not an extension of public \nlife but its antithesis. It meant a longing to put himself at the mercy of his partner. He \nwho gives himself up like a prisoner of wa r must give up his weapons as well. And \ndeprived in advance of defense against a possible blow, he cannot help wondering \nwhen the blow will fall. That is why I can say that for Franz, love meant the constant \nexpectation of a blow. \nWhile Franz attended to his anguish, his mistre ss put down her brush and went into the \nnext room. She returned with a bottle of wine. She opened it without a word and poured \nout two glasses. \nImmediately he felt relieved and slightly ridi culous. The I prefer Geneva did not mean \nshe refused to make love; quite the contrary , it meant she was tired of limiting their \nlovemaking to foreign cities. \nShe raised her glass and emptied it in one s wig. Franz did the same. He was naturally \noverjoyed that her refusal to go to Palermo was actually a call to love, but he was a bit \nsorry as well: his mistress seemed determi ned to violate the zo ne of Purity he had \nintroduced into their relationship; s he had failed to understand his apprehensive \nattempts to save their love from banality and separate it radically  from his conjugal \nhome. \nThe ban on making love with his painter-mistress in Geneva was actually a self-inflicted \npunishment for having married another woman. He felt it as a kind of guilt or defect. \nEven though his conjugal sex life was hardly worth mentioning, he and his wife still \nslept in the same bed, awoke in the middle of the night to each other's heavy breathing, \nand inhaled the smells of each other's body . True, he would rather have slept by \nhimself, but the marriage bed is still the sym bol of the marriage bond, and symbols, as \nwe know, are inviolable. \nEach time he lay down next to  his wife in that bed, he thought of his mistress imagining \nhim lying down next to his wi fe in that bed, and each time he thought of her he felt \nashamed. That was why he wished to separate  the bed he slept in with his wife as far \nas possible in space from the bed he made love in with his mistress. \nHis painter-mistress poured herself another glass of wine, drank it down, and then, still \nsilent and with a curious noncha lance, as if completely unaware of Franz's presence, \nslowly removed her blouse. She was behaving like an acting student whose \nimprovisation assignment is to make the class believe s he is alone in a room and no \none can see her. \nStanding there in her ski rt and bra, she suddenly (as if re calling only then that she was \nnot alone in the room) fixed Franz with a long stare. \nThat stare bewildered him; he could not  understand it. All lovers unconsciously \nestablish their own rules of the game, wh ich from the outset admit no transgression. \nThe stare she had just fixed on him fell outside their rules; it had nothing in common \nwith the looks and gestures that usually preceded their lovemaking. It was neither\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 42\nprovocative nor flirtatious, simply interroga tive. The problem was, Franz had not the \nslightest notion what it was asking. \nNext she stepped out of her skirt and, taking Franz by the hand, turned him in the \ndirection of a large mirror pr opped against the wall. Without letting go of his hand, she \nlooked into the mirror with the same long ques tioning stare, training it first on herself, \nthen on him. \nNear the mirror stood a wig stand with an old black bowler hat on it. She bent over, \npicked up the hat, and put it on her head. T he image in the mirror was instantaneously \ntransformed: suddenly it was a woman in  her undergarments, a beautiful, distant, \nindifferent woman with a terribly out-of-pl ace bowler hat on her head, holding the hand \nof a man in a gray suit and a tie. \nAgain he had to smile at how poorly he under stood his mistress. When she took her \nclothes off, it wasn't so much erotic provocation as an odd little caper, a happening a \ndeux. His smile beamed understanding and consent. \nHe waited for his mistress to respond in kind, but she did not. Without letting go of his \nhand, she stood staring into the mirror, first at herself, then at him. \nThe time for the happening had come and gone. Franz was beginning to feel that the \ncaper (which, in and of itself, he was happy to think of as charming) had dragged on too \nlong. So he gently took the brim of the bowler hat betw een two fingers, lifted it off \nSabina's head with a smile, and la id it back on the wig stand . It was as though he were \nerasing the mustache a naughty child had drawn on a picture of the Virgin Mary. \nFor several more seconds she remained moti onless, staring at her self in the mirror. \nThen Franz covered her with tender kisses and asked her once more to go with him in \nten days to Palermo. This time she said yes unquestioningly, and he left. \nHe was in an excellent  mood again. Geneva, which he had cursed all his life as the \nmetropolis of boredom, now se emed beautiful and full of adventure. Outside in the \nstreet, he looked back up at the studio's broad window. It was late spring and hot. All \nthe windows were shaded with striped awnings. Franz walked to the park. At its far end, \nthe golden cupolas of the Or thodox church rose up like two gilded cannonballs kept \nfrom imminent collapse and suspended in the air by some invisible Power. Everything \nwas beautiful. Then he went down to the embankment and took the public transport \nboat to the north bank of the lake, where he lived. \nSabina was now by herself. She went back to  the mirror, still in her underwear. She put \nthe bowler hat back on her head and had a long look at herself. She was amazed at the \nnumber of years she had spent pursuing one lost moment. \nOnce, during a visit to her studio many  years before, the bowler hat had caught \nTomas's fancy. He had set it on his head and looked at himself in the large mirror \nwhich, as in the Geneva studi o, leaned against the wall. He wanted to see what he \nwould have looked like as a nineteenth- century mayor. When Sabina started\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 43\nundressing, he put the hat on her  head. There they stood in front of the mirror (they \nalways stood in front of the mirror while  she undressed), watching themselves. She \nstripped to her underwear, but still had the hat on her head. And all at once she realized \nthey were both excited by what they saw in the mirror. \nWhat could have excited them so? A moment  before, the hat on  her head had seemed \nnothing but a joke. Was excitement really a mere step away from laughter? \nYes. When they looked at each other in the mirror that time, all she saw for the first few \nseconds was a comic situation. But suddenly the comic became veiled by excitement: \nthe bowler hat no longer signifi ed a joke; it signified violence; violence against Sabina, \nagainst her dignity as a woman. She saw he r bare legs and thin panties with her pubic \ntriangle showing through. The lingerie enhanced the charm of her femininity, while the \nhard masculine hat denied it, violated and ridiculed it. The fact that Tomas stood beside \nher fully dressed meant that the essence of  what they both saw was far from good \nclean fun (if it had been fun he was after, he, too, would have had to strip and don a \nbowler hat); it was humiliation. But instead of spurning it, she proudly, provocatively \nplayed it for all it was wort h, as if submitting of her own will to public rape; and \nsuddenly, unable to wait any longer, she pulled Tomas down to the floor. The bowler \nhat rolled under the table, and they began thrashing about on the rug at  the foot of the \nmirror. \nBut let us return to the bowler hat: \nFirst, it was a vague reminder of a for gotten grandfather, the mayor of a small \nBohemian town during the nineteenth century. \nSecond, it was a memento of her father. After the funeral  her brother appropriated all \ntheir parents' property, and she, refusing out of sovereign contempt to fight for her \nrights, announced sarcastically that she was taking the bowler hat as her sole \ninheritance. \nThird, it was a prop for her love games with Tomas. \nFourth, it was a sign of her originality, which she consciously cultivated. She could not \ntake much with her when she emigrated, and ta king this bulky, impractical thing meant \ngiving UP other, more practical ones. \nFifth, now that she was abroad, the hat wa s a sentimental objec t. When she went to \nvisit Tomas in Zurich, she took it alon g and had it on her head when he opened the \nhotel-room door. But then something she had not reckoned with happened: the hat, no \nlonger jaunty or sexy, turned into a monument  to time past. They were both touched. \nThey made love as they never had before. This was no occasion for obscene games. \nFor this meeting was not a continuation of their erotic rendezvous, each of which had \nbeen an opportunity to think up  some new little vice; it was a recapitulation of time, a \nhymn to their common past, a sentimental su mmary of an unsentimental story that was \ndisappearing in the distance.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 44\nThe bowler hat was a motif in the musical composition that was Sabina's life. It returned \nagain and again, each time with a different meaning, and all the meanings flowed \nthrough the bowler hat like water through a riverbed. I might call it Heraclitus' ( You \ncan't step twice into the same river ) ri verbed: the bowler hat was a bed through which \neach time Sabina saw anot her river flow, another semantic river: each time the same \nobject would give rise to a new meaning, though all former meanings would resonate \n(like an echo, like a parade of echoes) together with the new one. Each new experience \nwould resound, each time enriching the ha rmony. The reason why Tomas and Sabina \nwere touched by the sight of the bowler hat in a Zurich hot el and made love almost in \ntears was that its black pres ence was not merely a reminder  of their love games but \nalso a memento of Sabina's father and of her grandfather , who lived in a century \nwithout airplanes and cars. \nNow, perhaps, we are in a better position to understand the abyss separating Sabina \nand Franz: he listened eagerly to the story of her life and she was equally eager to hear \nthe story of his, but although they had a cl ear understanding of the logical meaning of \nthe words they exchanged, they failed to hear the semantic susurrus of the river flowing \nthrough them. \nAnd so when she put on the bowler hat in his presence, Franz felt uncomfortable, as if \nsomeone had spoken to him in a language he did not know. It was neither obscene nor \nsentimental, merely an incomprehensible ge sture. What made him feel uncomfortable \nwas its very lack of meaning. \nWhile people are fairly young and the musical composition of their lives is still in its \nopening bars, they can go about writing it  together and exchange motifs (the way \nTomas and Sabina exchanged the motif of the bow ler hat), but if they meet when they \nare older, like Franz and Sabina, their musical compositions are more or less complete, \nand every motif, every object, every word means something different to each of them. \nIf I were to make a record of all Sabina an d Franz's conversations, I could compile a \nlong lexicon of their misunderstandings. Let  us be content, instead, with a short \ndictionary. \nA Short Dictionary of Misunderstood Words \nWOMAN \nBeing a woman is a fate Sabina did not ch oose. What we have not chosen we cannot \nconsider either our merit or our failure. Sabina believed that she had to assume the \ncorrect attitude to her unchosen fate. To r ebel against being born a woman seemed as \nfoolish to her as to take pride in it. \nDuring one of their first times together, Fr anz announced to her, in an oddly emphatic \nway, Sabina, you are a woman. She could not understand why he accentuated the \nobvious with the solemnity of a Columbus who has just sight ed land. Not until later did \nshe understand that the word woman, on which he had placed such uncommon \nemphasis, did not, in his eyes, signify one of the two human sexes; it represented a \nvalue. Not every woman was worthy of being called a woman."

    "raw_text": "\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 45\nBut if Sabina was, in Franz's eyes, a woman, then what was his wife, Marie-Claude? \nMore than twenty years earlier, several mont hs after Franz met Marie-Claude, she had \nthreatened to take her life if he abandoned her. Franz was bew itched by the threat. He \nwas not particularly fond of Marie-Claude, but he was very much taken with her love. \nHe felt himself unworthy of so great a love, and felt he owed her a low bow. \nHe bowed so low that he married her. And even though Marie-Claude never recaptured \nthe emotional intensity that  accompanied her suicide thr eat, in his heart he kept its \nmemory alive with the thought that he must  never hurt her and always respect the \nwoman in her. \nIt is an interesting formulation. Not respec t Marie-Claude, but respect the woman in \nMarie-Claude.  \nBut if Marie-Claude is herself a woman, then who is that other woman hiding in her, the \none he must always respect? The Platonic ideal of a woman, perhaps? \nNo. His mother. It never would have occurr ed to him to say he respected the woman in \nhis mother. He worshipped his mother and not some woman inside her. His mother and \nthe Platonic ideal of womanhood were one and the same. \nWhen he was twelve, she sudd enly found herself alone, abandoned by Franz's father. \nThe boy suspected something serious had h appened, but his mother  muted the drama \nwith mild, insipid words so as not to upset  him. The day his father left, Franz and his \nmother went into town together, and as they  left home Franz noticed that her shoes did \nnot match. He was in a quandary: he wanted to point out her mistake, but was afraid he \nwould hurt her. So during the two hours they spent walking through the city together he \nkept his eyes fixed on her feet. It was then he had his first inkling of what it means to \nsuffer. \nFIDELITY AND BETRAYAL \nHe loved her from the time he was a child until the time he acco mpanied her to the \ncemetery; he loved her in his me mories as well. That is what  made him feel that fidelity \ndeserved pride of place amon g the virtues: fidelity gave a unity to lives that would \notherwise splinter into thousands of split-second impressions. \nFranz often spoke about his mother to  Sabina, perhaps even with a certain \nunconscious ulterior motive: he assumed that Sabina would be charmed by his ability to \nbe faithful, that it would win her over. \nWhat he did not know was that  Sabina was charmed more by betrayal than by fidelity. \nThe word fidelity reminded her of her fath er, a small-town puritan, who spent his \nSundays painting away at canvases of wo odland sunsets and roses in vases. Thanks \nto him, she started drawing as a child. Wh en she was fourteen, s he fell in love with a \nboy her age. Her father was so frightened t hat he would not let her out of the house by \nherself for a year. One day, he showed her some Picasso reproductions and made fun \nof them. If she couldn't love her fourteen-year-old schoolboy, she could at least love\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 46\ncubism. After completing school, she went off to Prague with the eup horic feeling that \nnow at last she could betray her home. \nBetrayal. From tender youth we are told by father and teacher  that betrayal is the most \nheinous offense imaginable. But what is bet rayal? Betrayal means breaking ranks. \nBetrayal means breaking ranks and going off into the unknown. S abina knew of nothing \nmore magnificent than going off into the unknown. \nThough a student at the Academy of Fine Arts, she was not allowed to paint like \nPicasso. It was the period when so-called socialist realism was prescribed and the \nschool manufactured Portraits of Communist  statesmen. Her lo nging to betray her \nrather remained unsatisfied: Communism was merely another rather, a father equally \nstrict and limited, a father who forbade her love (the times were puritanical) and \nPicasso, too. And if she married a second-rate actor, it was only because he had a \nreputation for being eccentric and was unacceptable to both fathers. \nThen her mother died. The day following her  return to Prague fr om the funeral, she \nreceived a telegram saying that her father had taken his life out of grief. \nSuddenly she felt pangs of co nscience: Was it really so terrible that her father had \npainted vases filled with roses and hated Picass o? Was it really so reprehensible that \nhe was afraid of his fourteen-year-old daug hter's coming home pregnant? Was it really \nso laughable that he could not go on living without his wife? \nAnd again she felt a longing to betray: bet ray her own betrayal. She announced to her \nhusband (whom she now considered a difficult drunk rather than an eccentric) that she \nwas leaving him. \nBut if we betray B., for whom we betrayed A., it does not necessarily follow that we \nhave placated A. The life of a divorcee-painter did not in the least resemble the life of \nthe parents she had betrayed. The first betrayal is i rreparable. It calls forth a chain \nreaction of further betrayals, each of which takes us farther and farther away from the \npoint of our original betrayal. \nMUSIC \nFor Franz music was the art that comes cl osest to Dionysian beauty in the sense of \nintoxication. No one can get really drunk on a novel or a painting, but who can help \ngetting drunk on Beethoven's Ninth, Bartok's Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion, or \nthe Beatles' White Album? Franz made no distinction between classical music and pop. \nHe found the distinction old- fashioned and hypocritical. He loved rock as much as \nMozart. \nHe considered music a liberating force: it liberated him from loneliness, introversion, the \ndust of the library; it opened the door of his body  and allowed his soul to step out into \nthe world to make friends. He loved to dance  and regretted that Sabina did not share \nhis passion.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 47\nThey were sitting together at a restaurant, and loud music with a heavy beat poured out \nof a nearby speaker as they ate. \nIt's a vicious circle, Sabina said. People ar e going deaf because music is played louder \nand louder. But because they're going deaf, it has to be played louder still.  \nDon't you like music? Franz asked. \nNo, said Sabina, and then adde d, though in a different era... She was thinking of the \ndays of Johann Sebastian Bach, when music was like a rose blooming on a boundless \nsnow-covered plain of silence. \nNoise masked as music had pursued her since early childhood. During her years at the \nAcademy of Fine Arts, students had been required to spend whole summer vacations at \na youth camp. They lived in common quarte rs and worked together on a steelworks \nconstruction site. Music roared out of loudspeakers on the site from five in the morning \nto nine at night. She felt like crying, but the music was cheerful, and there was nowhere \nto hide, not in the latrine or under the bedclothes: everything was in range of the \nspeakers. The music was like a pack of hounds that had been sicked on her. \nAt the time, she had thought that only in the Communist world could such musical \nbarbarism reign supreme. Abroad, she discovered that the transformation of music into \nnoise was a planetary process by which mank ind was entering the hi storical phase of \ntotal ugliness. The total ugliness to come had made itself felt first as omnipresent \nacoustical ugliness: cars, moto rcycles, electric guitars, drills, loudspeakers, sirens. The \nomnipresence of visual ugliness would soon follow. \nAfter dinner, they went upstairs to their r oom and made love, and as Franz fell asleep \nhis thoughts began to lose coherence. He recalled the noisy music at dinner and said to \nhimself, Noise has one advantage. It drowns out words. And suddenly he realized that \nall his life he had done nothing  but talk, write, lecture, concoct sentences, search for \nformulations and amend them, so in the end no words were precise, their meanings \nwere obliterated, their content lost, they turned into trash, chaff, dust, sand; prowling \nthrough his brain, tearing at his head, they were his insomnia, his illness. And what he \nyearned for at that moment, vaguely but with all his might, was unbounded music, \nabsolute sound, a pleasant and happy all-encompassing, overpowering, window-rattling \ndin to engulf, once and for all, the pain, the fu tility, the vanity of words. Music was the \nnegation of sentences, music was the anti-word! He yearned for one long embrace with \nSabina, yearned never to say another sentence, another word, to let his orgasm fuse \nwith the orgiastic thunder of music. And lull ed by that blissful imaginary uproar, he fell \nasleep. \nLIGHT AND DARKNESS \nLiving for Sabina meant seeing. Seeing is limited by two borders: strong light, which \nblinds, and total darkness. Perhaps that was what motivated Sabina's distaste for all \nextremism. Extremes mean borders beyond which life ends, and a passion for \nextremism, in art and in politics, is a veiled longing for death. \nIn Franz the word light did not evoke the pi cture of a landscape basking in the soft glow \nof day; it evoked the source of light itsel f: the sun, a light bulb,  a spotlight. Franz's\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 48\nassociations were familiar metaphors: the s un of righteousness, the lambent flame of \nthe intellect, and so on. \nDarkness attracted him as much as light. He knew that these days turning out the light \nbefore making love was considered laughabl e, and so he always left a small lamp \nburning over the bed. At t he moment he penetrated Sabi na, however, he closed his \neyes. The pleasure suffusing his body called for darkness. That darkness was pure, \nperfect, thoughtless, visionless;  that darkness was without end, without borders; that \ndarkness was the infinite we each carry within us . (Yes, if you're looking for infinity, just \nclose your eyes!) \nAnd at the moment he felt pleasure suffusi ng his body, Franz himself disintegrated and \ndissolved into the infinity of his darkness, himself becoming infinite. But the larger a \nman grows in his own inner darkness, the mo re his outer form diminishes. A man with \nclosed eyes is a wreck of a man. Then, Sabi na found the sight of Franz distasteful, and \nto avoid looking at him s he too closed her eyes. But fo r her, darkness did not mean \ninfinity; for her, it meant a disagreement wit h what she saw, the negation of what was \nseen, the refusal to see. \nSabina once allowed herself to be taken al ong to a gathering of fellow emigres. As \nusual, they were hashing over whether they  should or should not have taken up arms \nagainst the Russians. In the safety of emigrati on, they all naturally came out in favor of \nfighting. Sabina said: Then why don't you go back and fight?  \nThat was not the thing to sa y. A man with artificially wa ved gray hair pointed a long \nindex finger at her. That's no way to talk . You're all responsib le for what happened. \nYou, too. How did you oppose the Communist regime? All you did was paint pictures. ...  \nAssessing the populace, checking up on it, is  a principal and never-ending social \nactivity in Communist countries. If a painter is to have an exhibition, an ordinary citizen \nto receive a visa to a country with a sea coast, a soccer player to join the national team, \nthen a vast array of recommendations a nd reports must be garnered (from the \nconcierge, colleagues, the pol ice, the local Party organization, the pertinent trade \nunion) and added up, we ighed, and summarized by special officials. These reports \nhave nothing to do with artistic talent, kicking ability, or maladies that respond well to \nsalt sea air; they deal with one thing only: the citizen's political profile (in other words, \nwhat the citizen says, what he thinks, how he behaves, how he acquits himself at \nmeetings or May Day parades). Because ever ything (day-to-day ex istence, promotion \nat work, vacations) depends on the outcome  of the assessment process, everyone \n(whether he wants to play soccer for the national team, have an exhibition, or spend his \nholidays at the seaside) must behave in such a way as to deserve a favorable \nassessment. \nThat was what ran through Sabina's mind as she listened to the gray-haired man \nspeak. He didn't care whether his fellow -countrymen were good kickers or painters \n(none of the Czechs at the em igre gathering ever showed any  interest in what Sabina \npainted); he cared whether they had opposed Communism actively or just passively,\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 49\nreally and truly or just for appearances' sake , from the very beginning or just since \nemigration. \nBecause she was a painter, she had an eye for detail and a memory for the physical \ncharacteristics of the peopl e in Prague who had a passion for assessing others. All of \nthem had index fingers slightly longer than their middle  fingers and pointed them at \nwhomever they happened to be talking to. In fact, President Novotny, who had ruled the \ncountry for the fourteen year s preceding 1968, sported t he very same barber-induced \ngray waves and had the longest index finger of all the inhabitants of Central Europe. \nWhen the distinguished emigre heard from the lips of a painter whose pictures he had \nnever seen that he resembl ed Communist President Novotny, he turned scarlet, then \nwhite, then scarlet again, then white once more; he tried to say something, did not \nsucceed, and fell silent. Everyone else kept silent until Sabina stood up and left. \nIt made her unhappy, and down in the street s he asked herself why she should bother \nto maintain contact with Czechs. What bound her to them? The landscape? If each of \nthem were asked to say what the name of his native country evoked in him, the images \nthat came to mind would be so different as to rule out all possibility of unity. \nOr the culture? But what wa s that? Music? Dvorak and J anacek? Yes. But what if a \nCzech had no feeling for music? Then the essence of being Czech vanished into thin \nair. \nOr great men? Jan Hus? None of the people in  that room had ever  read a line of his \nworks. The only thing they were all able to  understand was the flam es, the glory of the \nflames when he was burned at t he stake, the glory of the ashes, so for them the \nessence of being Czech came down to ashes and nothing more. The only things that \nheld them together were t heir defeats and the reproaches they addressed to one \nanother. \nShe was walking fast. She was more distur bed by her own thoughts than by her break \nwith the emigres. She knew sh e was being unfair. There were  other Czechs, after all, \npeople quite different from the man with the long index finger. The embarrassed silence \nthat followed her little speech did not by any means indicate they were all against her. \nNo, they were probably bewildered by t he sudden hatred, the lack of understanding \nthey were all subjected to in emigration.  Then why wasn't she sorry for them? Why \ndidn't she see them for the woeful and abandoned creatures they were? \nWe know why. After she betrayed her father , life opened up before he r, a long road of \nbetrayals, each one attracting her as vice and victory. She would not keep ranks! She \nrefused to keep ranks—always with the same people, with the same speeches! That \nwas why she was so stirred by her own injustice. But it was not an unpleasant feeling; \nquite the contrary, Sabina had the impression she had ju st scored a victory and \nsomeone invisible was applauding her for it.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 50\nThen suddenly the intoxication gave way to  anguish: The road had to end somewhere! \nSooner or later she would hav e to put an end to her bet rayals! Sooner or later she \nwould have to stop herself! \nIt was evening and she was hurrying thr ough the railway station. The train to \nAmsterdam was in. She found her coach. Guided by a friendly guard, she opened the \ndoor to her compartment and f ound Franz sitting on a couchette. He rose to greet her; \nshe threw her arms around him and smothered him with kisses. \nShe had an overwhelming desire to tell him, lik e the most banal of women, Don't let me \ngo, hold me tight, make me your plaything, your slave, be strong! But they were words \nshe could not say. \nThe only thing she said when he released he r from his embrace was, You don't know \nhow happy I am to be with you. That was the most her reserved nature allowed her to \nexpress. \nA Short Dictionary of Misunderstood Words (continued} \nPARADES \nPeople in Italy or France hav e it easy. When their parents force them to go to church, \nthey get back at them by joining the Party (Communist, Maoist, Trotskyist, etc.). Sabina, \nhowever, was first sent to church by her fa ther, then forced by him to attend meetings \nof the Communist Youth League.  He was afraid of what  would happen if she stayed \naway. \nWhen she marched in the obligatory May Da y parades, she could never keep in step, \nand the girl behind her would shout at her  and purposely tread on her heels. When the \ntime came to sing, she never knew the words of the songs and would merely open and \nclose her mouth. But the other girls would notice and report her. From her youth on, she \nhated parades. \nFranz had studied in Paris, and because he was extraordinarily gifted his scholarly \ncareer was assured from the time he was tw enty. At twenty, he k new he would live out \nhis life within the confines of his university office, one or two libraries, and two or three \nlecture halls. The idea of such a life made him feel suffocated. He yearned to step out \nof his life the way one steps out of a house into the street. \nAnd so as long as he lived in Paris, he took  part in every possible demonstration. How \nnice it was to celebrate something, deman d something, protest against something; to \nbe out in the open, to be with others. The parades filing down the Boulevard Saint-\nGermain or from the Place de la Republique to the Bastille fascinated him. He saw the \nmarching, shouting crowd as the image of  Europe and its history. Europe was the \nGrand March. The march from revolution to revolution, from struggle to struggle, ever \nonward. \nI might put it another way: Franz  felt his book life to be unreal. He yearned for real life, \nfor the touch of people walki ng side by side with him, for t heir shouts. It never occurred\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 51\nto him that what he considered  unreal (the work he did in the solitude of the office or \nlibrary) was in fact his real life, whereas  the parades he imagined to be reality were \nnothing but theater, dance, carnival—in other words, a dream. \nDuring her studies, Sabina lived in a dormi tory. On May Day all the students had to \nreport early in the morning for the parade. St udent officials would comb the building to \nensure that no one was missing. Sabina hid in  the lavatory. Not until long after the \nbuilding was empty would she go back to her  room. It was quieter than anywhere she \ncould remember. The only sound was the par ade music echoing in the distance. It was \nas though she had found refuge inside a shell and the only sound she could hear was \nthe sea of an inimical world. \nA year or two after emigrating, she happened to be in Paris on the anniversary of the \nRussian invasion of her country. A prot est march had been scheduled, and she felt \ndriven to take part. Fists raised high , the young Frenchmen shouted out slogans \ncondemning Soviet imperialism.  She liked the slogans, but to her surprise she found \nherself unable to shout along with them. She lasted no more than a few minutes in the \nparade. \nWhen she told her French friends about it, they were amazed. You mean you don't \nwant to fight the occupation of your country? She would have liked to tell them that \nbehind Communism, Fascism, behind all occupations and invasions lurks a more basic, \npervasive evil and that the image of that evil was a par ade of people marching by with \nraised fists and shouting identical syllables in unison. But she knew she would never be \nable to make them understand. Embarrassed, she changed the subject. \nTHE BEAUTY OF NEW YORK \nFranz and Sabina would walk th e streets of New York for hours at a time. The view \nchanged with each step, as if they were fo llowing a winding mountain path surrounded \nby breathtaking scenery: a young man kneeling in the middle of the sidewalk praying; \na few steps away, a beautiful black woman leaning against a tree; a man in a black suit \ndirecting an invisible orchestra while crossing the street; a fountain spurting water and a \ngroup of construction workers sitting on the rim eating lunch; strange iron ladders \nrunning up and down buildings wi th ugly red facades, so ugly that they were beautiful; \nand next door, a huge glass skyscraper backed by another, itself topped by a small \nArabian pleasure-dome with turrets, galleries, and gilded columns. \nShe was reminded of her paintings. There, too, incongruous things came together: a \nsteelworks construction site superimposed on  a kerosene lamp; an old-fashioned lamp \nwith a painted-glass shade shattered into tiny  splinters and rising up over a desolate \nlandscape of marshland. \nFranz said, Beauty in the Eu ropean sense has always had a premeditated quality to it. \nWe've always had an aesthetic intention and a long-range plan. That's what enabled \nWestern man to spend decades building a Goth ic cathedral or a Renaissance piazza. \nThe beauty of New York rests on a completely different base. It's unintentional. It arose\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 52\nindependent of human design, like a stalagmitic cavern. Forms which are in themselves \nquite ugly turn up fortuitously, without design,  in such incredible surroundings that they \nsparkle with a sudden wondrous poetry.  \nSabina said, Unintentional beauty. Yes. Anot her way of putting it might be 'beauty by \nmistake.' Before beauty disappears entirely from the earth, it will go on existing for a \nwhile by mistake. 'Beauty by mistake'—the final phase in the history of beauty.  \nAnd she recalled her first mature painting,  which came into being because some red \npaint had dripped on it by mi stake. Yes, her paintings were based on beauty by \nmistake, and New York was the secret but authentic homeland of her painting. \nFranz said, Perhaps New York's unintentional  beauty is much richer and more varied \nthan the excessively strict  and composed beauty of human de sign. But it's not our \nEuropean beauty. It's an alien world.  \nDidn't they then at last agree on something? \nNo. There is a difference. Sabina was very much attracted by the alien quality of New \nYork's beauty. Franz found it intriguing but frightening; it  made him feel homesick for \nEurope. \nSABINA'S COUNTRY \nSabina understood Franz's distaste for Amer ica. He was the embodiment of Europe: \nhis mother was Viennese, his father French, and he himself was Swiss. \nFranz greatly admired Sabina's country. Whenev er she told him about herself and her \nfriends from home, Franz heard the words prison, persecution, enemy tanks, \nemigration, pamphlets, banned books, banned exhibitions, and he felt a curious mixture \nof envy and nostalgia. \nHe made a confession to Sabina. A philosopher once wrote that everything in my work \nis unverifiable speculat ion and called me a 'pse udo-Socrates.' I felt terribly humiliated \nand made a furious response. And just thin k, that laughable epis ode was the greatest \nconflict I've ever experienced! The pinnacle of the dramatic possibilities available to my \nlife! We live in two different dimensions, you and I. You came into my life like Gulliver \nentering the land of the Lilliputians.  \nSabina protested. She said that conflict, drama, and tragedy didn't mean a thing; there \nwas nothing inherently valuable in them, no thing deserving of respect or admiration. \nWhat was truly enviable was Franz's work and the fact that he had the peace and quiet \nto devote himself to it. \nFranz shook his head. When a society is rich , its people don't need to work with their \nhands; they can devote themselves to activiti es of the spirit. We have more and more \nuniversities and more and more students. If students are going to earn degrees, they've \ngot to come up with dissertation topics. An d since dissertations can be written about \neverything under the sun, the number of topics is infi nite. Sheets of paper covered with\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 53\nwords pile up in archives sadder than cemete ries, because no one ever visits them, not \neven on All Souls' Day. Culture is perish ing in overproduction, in an avalanche of \nwords, in the madness of quantity. That's why one banned book in your former country \nmeans infinitely more than the billions of words spewed out by our universities.  \nIt is in this spirit that we may understand  Franz's weakness for revolution. First he \nsympathized with Cuba, then with China, and when the cruelty  of their regimes began \nto appall him, he resigned himself with a sigh to a sea of words with no weight and no \nresemblance to life. He became a prof essor in Geneva (where there are no \ndemonstrations), and in a bur st of abnegation (in womanle ss, paradeless solitude) he \npublished several scholarly boo ks, all of which received c onsiderable acclaim. Then \none day along came Sabina. She was a reve lation. She came from a land where \nrevolutionary illusion had long since faded but where the thing he admired most in \nrevolution remained: life on a large scale; a life of risk, daring, and the danger  of death. \nSabina had renewed his fait h in the grandeur of human endeavor. Superimposing the \npainful drama of her country on her person, he found her even more beautiful. \nThe trouble was that Sabina had no love for that drama. The words prison, persecution, \nbanned books, occupation, tanks were ugly, without the slightest trace of romance. The \nonly word that evoked in her a sweet, nostalgic memory of her homeland was the word \ncemetery.  \nCEMETERY \nCemeteries in Bohemia are like gardens. The graves are covered with grass and \ncolorful flowers. Modest tombstones are lost in the greenery. When the sun goes down, \nthe cemetery sparkles with tiny candles. It looks as though the dead are dancing at a \nchildren's ball. Yes, a children's ball, because  the dead are as innocent as children. No \nmatter how brutal life becomes, peace always reigns in the cemetery. Even in wartime, \nin Hitler's time, in Stalin's time, through al l occupations. When she felt low, she would \nget into the car, leave Prague far behind,  and walk through one or another of the \ncountry cemeteries she loved so well. Agains t a backdrop of blue hills, they were as \nbeautiful as a lullaby. \nFor Franz a cemetery was an ugly dump of stones and bones. \nI'd never drive. I'm scared stiff of accidents! Even if they don't kill you, they mark you for \nlife! And so saying, the sculptor made an in stinctive grab for the finger he had nearly \nchopped off one day while whittling away at a wood statue. It was a miracle the finger \nhad been saved. \nWhat do you mean? said Marie- Claude in a raucous voice. She was in top form. I was \nin a serious accident once, and I wouldn't have  missed it for the world. And I've never \nhad more fun than when I was in that hospital! I couldn't sleep a wink, so I just read and \nread, day and night.  \nThey all looked at her in amazement. She ba sked in it. Franz reac ted with a mixture of \ndisgust (he knew that after the accident in question his wife had fallen into a deep\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 54\ndepression and complained ince ssantly) and admiration (her  ability to transform \neverything she experienced was a sign of true vitality). \nIt was there I began to divide books into day books and night books, she went on. \nReally, there are books meant for daytime reading and books that can be read only at \nnight.  \nNow they all looked at her in  amazement and admiration, all, that is, but the sculptor, \nwho was still holding his finger and wrinkling his face at the memory of the accident. \nMarie-Claude turned to him and asked, Which category would you put Stendhal in?  \nThe sculptor had not heard the question and sh rugged his shoulders uncomfortably. An \nart critic standing next to him said he thought of Stendhal as daytime reading. \nMarie-Claude shook her head and said in her raucous voice,  No, no, you're wrong! \nYou're wrong! Stendhal is a night author!  \nFranz's participation in the debate on night art and day art was dist urbed by the fact \nthat he was expecting Sabina to show up at any minute. They had spent many days \npondering whether or not she should accept the invitation to this cocktail party. It was a \nparty Marie-Claude was giving for all painte rs and sculptors who had  ever exhibited in \nher private gallery. Ever since Sabina ha d met Franz, she had avoided his wife. But \nbecause they feared being found out, they came to the conclusion that it would be more \nnatural and therefore less suspicious for her to come. \nWhile throwing unobtrusive looks in the direct ion of the entrance hall, Franz heard his \neighteen-year-old daughter, Marie-Anne, holding forth at the other end of the room. Ex-\ncusing himself from the group presided over by his wife, he made his way to the group \npresided over by his daughter. Some were in  chairs, others standing, but Marie-Anne \nwas cross-legged on the floor. Franz was cert ain that Marie-Claude would soon switch \nto the carpet on her side of the room, too.  Sitting on the floor when you had guests was \nat the time a gesture signifyi ng simplicity, informality, liberal  politics, hospitality, and a \nParisian way of life. The passion with wh ich Marie-Claude sat on all floors was such \nthat Franz began to worry she would take to  sitting on the floor of the shop where she \nbought her cigarettes. \nWhat are you working on now, Alain? Marie- Anne asked the man at whose feet she \nwas sitting. \nAlain was so naive and sincere as to try to give the gallery owner's daughter an honest \nanswer. He started explaini ng his new approach to her, a co mbination of photography \nand oil, but he had scarcely got through th ree sentences when  Marie-Anne began \nwhistling a tune. The painter was speaking slowly and with great concentration and did \nnot hear the whistling. Will you tell me why you're whistling? Franz whispered. Because \nI don't like to hear people talk about politics, she answered out loud. \nAnd in fact, two men standing in the same circle were discussing the coming elections \nin France. Marie-Anne, who felt it her dut y to direct the proceedings, asked the men \nwhether they were planning to go to the Rossini opera an Italian company was putting\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 55\non in Geneva the following week. Meanwhile, Al ain the painter sank into greater and \ngreater detail about his new approach to painting. Franz was ashamed for his daughter. \nTo put her in her place, he announced that  whenever she went to the opera she \ncomplained terribly of boredom. \nYou're awful, said Marie-Anne, trying to  punch him in the stomach from a sitting \nposition. The star tenor is so handsome. So handsome. I've seen him twice now, and \nI'm in love with him.  \nFranz could not get over how much like her mother his daughter was. Why couldn't she \nbe like him? But there was nothing he could do about it. She was not like him. How \nmany times had he heard Marie-Claude proclaim  she was in love with this or that \npainter, singer, writer, politic ian, and once even with a racing cyclist? Of course, it was \nall mere cocktail party rhetoric, but he coul d not help recalling no w and then that more \nthan twenty years ago she had  gone about saying the same thing about-him and \nthreatening him with suicide to boot. \nAt that point, Sabina entered the room. Marie-Claude walked up to her. While Marie-\nAnne went on about Rossini, Fr anz trained his attention on what the two women were \nsaying. After a few friendly words of greet ing, Marie-Claude lifted the ceramic pendant \nfrom Sabina's neck and said in a very loud voice, What is that? How ugly!  \nThose words made a deep impression on Franz. They were not meant to be combative; \nthe raucous laughter immediatel y following them made it cl ear that by rejecting the \npendant Marie-Claude did not wish to jeopardize her friendshi p with Sabina. But it was \nnot the kind of thing she usually said. \nI made it myself, said Sabina. \nThat pendant is ugly, really! Marie-Claude repeated very loudly. You shouldn't wear it.  \nFranz knew his wife didn't care whether the pendant was ugly or not. An object was \nugly if she willed it ugly, beautif ul if she willed it beautiful . Pendants worn by her friends \nwere a priori beautiful. And even if she did find them ugly, she would never say so, \nbecause flattery had long since become second nature to her. \nWhy, then, did she decide that the pendant Sabina had made herself was ugly? \nFranz suddenly saw the answer plainly: Ma rie-Claude proclaimed Sabina's pendant \nugly because she could afford to do so. \nOr to be more precise: Marie-Claude proclaimed Sabina's pendant ugly to make it clear \nthat she could afford to tell Sabina her pendant was ugly. \nSabina's exhibition the year before had no t been particularly successful, so Marie-\nClaude did not set great stor e by Sabina's favor. Sabina, however, had every reason to \nset store by Marie-Claude's. Yet that was not at all evident from her behavior.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 56\nYes, Franz saw it plainly:  Marie-Claude had taken advantage of the occasion to make \nclear to Sabina (and others) what the real balance of pow er was between  the two of \nthem. \nA Short Dictionary of Misunderstood Words (concluded) \nTHE OLD CHURCH IN AMSTERDAM \nThere are houses running along one side of  the street, and behind the large ground-\nfloor shop-front windows all the whores have little rooms and plushly pillowed armchairs \nin which they sit up close to the glass we aring bras and panties. They look like big \nbored cats. \nOn the other side of the street  is a gigantic Gothic cathedral  dating from the fourteenth \ncentury. \nBetween the whores' world and G od's world, like a river dividing two empires, stretches \nan intense smell of urine. \nInside the Old Church, all that is left of the Gothic style is the high, bare, white walls, the \ncolumns, the vaulting, and the windows. There is not a single image on the walls, not a \nsingle piece of statuary anywhere. The church  is as empty as a gymnasium, except in \nthe very center, where several rows of chairs have been arranged in a large square \naround a miniature podium for the minister. Behind the chairs are wooden booths, stalls \nfor wealthy burghers. \nThe chairs and stalls seem to have been plac ed there without the s lightest concern for \nthe shape of the walls or po sition of the columns, as if wishing to express their \nindifference to or disdain for Gothic architecture. Centuries ago Calvinist faith turned the \ncathedral into a hangar, its only function being to keep the pr ayers of the faithful safe \nfrom rain and snow. \nFranz was fascinated by it: the Grand March of History had passed through this gigantic \nhall! \nSabina recalled how after the Communist coup all the castles in Bohemia were \nnationalized and turned into manual training centers, retirement homes, and also cow \nsheds. She had visited one of the cow sheds: hooks for iron rings had been hammered \ninto the stucco walls, and cows tied to t he rings gazed dreamily out of the windows at \nthe castle grounds, now overrun with chickens. \nIt's the emptiness of it that fascinates me, said Franz. People collect altars, statues, \npaintings, chairs, carpets, and books, and t hen comes a time of joyful relief and they \nthrow it all out like so much refuse from yest erday's dinner table. Can't you just picture \nHercules' broom sweeping out this cathedral?  \nThe poor had to stand, while the rich had stalls, said Sabina, pointing to them. But there \nwas something that bound the bankers to beggars: a hatred of beauty.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 57\nWhat is beauty? said Franz, and he saw himself attending a recent gallery preview at \nhis wife's side, and at her insistence. The e ndless vanity of speeches and words, the \nvanity of culture, the vanity of art. \nWhen Sabina was working in the student brigade, her soul poisoned by the cheerful \nmarches issuing incessantly from the lo udspeakers, she borrowed a motorcycle one \nSunday and headed for the hills. She stopped at a tiny remote village she had never \nseen before, leaned the motorcycle against the church, and went in. A mass happened \nto be in progress. Religion was persecuted by the regi me, and most people gave the \nchurch a wide berth. The only people in the pews were old men and old women, \nbecause they did not fear the regime. They feared only death. \nThe priest intoned words in a singsong voic e, and the people rep eated them after him \nin unison. It was a litany. The same word s kept coming back, like a wanderer who \ncannot tear his eyes away from the countr yside or like a man who cannot take leave of \nlife. She sat in one of the last pews, closin g her eyes to hear the music of the words, \nopening them to stare up at the blue vault dotted with large gold stars. She was en-\ntranced. \nWhat she had unexpectedly met there in the village church was not God; it was beauty. \nShe knew perfectly well that neither the church nor the litany was beautiful in and of \nitself, but they were beautiful compared to the construction site, where she spent her \ndays amid the racket of the songs. The mass was beautiful because it appeared to her \nin a sudden, mysterious revelation as a world betrayed. \nFrom that time on she had known that beauty is a world betrayed. The only way we can \nencounter it is if its persecutors have over looked it somewhere. Beauty hides behind \nthe scenes of the May Day parade. If we want to find it, we must demolish the scenery. \nThis is the first time I've ever been fascinated by a church, said Franz. \nIt was neither Protestantism nor asceticism  that made him so enthusiastic; it was \nsomething else, something highly personal,  something he did not dare discuss with \nSabina. He thought he heard a voice telling him to seize Hercules' broom and sweep all \nof Marie-Claude's previews, all of Marie-Anne' s singers, all lectures and symposia, all \nuseless speeches and vain words—sweep them out of his life. Th e great empty space \nof Amsterdam's Old Church  had appeared to him in a sudden and mysterious \nrevelation as the image of his own liberation. \nSTRENGTH \nStroking Franz's arms in bed in one of the many hotels where they made love, Sabina \nsaid, The muscles you have! They're unbelievable!  \nFranz took pleasure in her praise. He cl imbed out of bed, got down on his haunches, \ngrabbed a heavy oak chair by one leg, and lifted it slowly into the air. You never have to \nbe afraid, he said. I can protect you no matter what. I used to be a judo champion.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 58\nWhen he raised the hand with the heavy chair above his head, Sabina said, It's good to \nknow you're so strong.  \nBut deep down she said to herself, Franz may be strong, but his st rength is directed \noutward; when it comes to the people he lives  with, the people he loves, he's weak. \nFranz's weakness is called goodness. Franz would never give Sabina orders. He would \nnever command her, as Tomas had, to lay the mirror on the floor and walk back and \nforth on it naked. Not that he lacks sensualit y; he simply lacks the strength to give \norders. There are things that can be accomp lished only by violence.  Physical love is \nunthinkable without violence. \nSabina watched Franz walk across the room  with the chair above his head; the scene \nstruck her as grotesque and filled her with an odd sadness. \nFranz set the chair down on the floor opposite Sabina and sat in it. I enjoy being strong, \nof course, he said, but what good do these muscles do me in Geneva? They're like an \nornament, a peacock feather. I've never fought anyone in my life.  \nSabina proceeded with her melancholy musings : What if she had a man who ordered \nher about? A man who wanted to master her? How long would she put up with him? \nNot five minutes! From which it follows that no man was right for her. Strong or weak. \nWhy don't you ever use your strength on me? she said. \nBecause love means renouncing strength, said Franz softly. \nSabina realized two things: first, that Franz 's words were noble a nd just; second, that \nthey disqualified him from her love life. \nLIVING IN TRUTH \nSuch is the formula set forth by Kafka so mewhere in the diaries or letters. Franz \ncouldn't quite remember where.  But it captivated him. What does it mean to live in \ntruth? Putting it negatively is easy enough: it  means not lying, not hiding, and not \ndissimulating. From the time he met Sabi na, however, Franz had been living in lies. He \ntold his wife about nonexistent congresses in  Amsterdam and lectur es in Madrid; he \nwas afraid to walk with Sabina through the streets of Geneva. And he enjoyed the lying \nand hiding: it was all so new to him. He was as excited as a teacher's pet who has \nplucked up the courage to play truant. \nFor Sabina, living in truth, lying neither to  ourselves nor to ot hers, was possible only \naway from the public: the mo ment someone keeps an eye on what we do, allowances \nfor that eye, and nothing we do is truthful. Having a public , keeping a public in mind, \nmeans living in lies. Sabina de spised literature in which people  give away all kinds of \nintimate secrets about themselves and their friends. A man who loses his privacy loses \neverything, Sabina thought. And a man who gives it up of his own free will is a monster. \nThat was why Sabina did not suffer in the leas t from having to keep her love secret. On \nthe contrary, only by doing so could she live in truth.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 59\nFranz, on the other hand, was cert ain that the division of lif e into private and public \nspheres is the source of all lies: a person is one thing in private and something quite \ndifferent in public. For Franz , living in truth meant break ing down the barriers between \nthe private and the public. He was fond of quoting Andre Bret on on the desirability of \nliving in a glass house into which everyone can look and there are no secrets. \nWhen he heard his wife telling Sabina, That  pendant is ugly! he knew he could no \nlonger live in lies and had to stand up for Sabi na. He had not done so only because he \nwas afraid of betraying their secret love. \nThe day after the cocktail party, he was su pposed to go to Rome with Sabina for the \nweekend. He could not get That pendant is ugly! out of his mind, and it made him see \nMarie-Claude in a completely new light. Her aggressiveness—invulnerable, noisy, and \nfull of vitality—relieved him of the burden of goodness he had patiently borne all twenty-\nthree years of their marriage. He recalled th e enormous inner space of the Old Church \nin Amsterdam and felt the strange incomprehens ible ecstasy that void had evoked in \nhim. \nHe was packing his overnight bag when Mari e-Claude came into the room, chatting \nabout the guests at the party, energetically endorsing the view s of some and laughing \noff the views of others. \nFranz looked at her for a long time and said, There isn't any conference in Rome.  \nShe did not see the point. Then why are y ou going? I've had a mistress for nine \nmonths, he said. I don't want to  meet her in Geneva. That's  why I've been traveling so \nmuch. I thought it was time you knew about it.  \nAfter the first few words he lost his nerve. He turned away so as not  to see the despair \non Marie-Claude's face, the despair he expected his words to produce. \nAfter a short pause he heard her say, Yes, I think it's time I knew about it.  \nHer voice was so firm that Franz turned in her direction. She did not look at all \ndisturbed; in fact, she looked like the very same woman who had said the day before in \na raucous voice, That pendant is ugly!  \nShe continued: Now that you've plucked up the courage to tell me you've been \ndeceiving me for nine months, do you think you can tell me who she is?  \nHe had always told himself he had no right to hurt Marie-Claude and should respect the \nwoman in her. But where had the woman in her gone? In other words, what had \nhappened to the mother image he mentally lin ked with his wife? His mother, sad and \nwounded, his mother, wearing unmatched s hoes, had departed from Marie-Claude—or \nperhaps not, perhaps she had never been inside Marie-Claude at  all. The whole thing \ncame to him in a flash of hatred.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 60\nI have no reason to hide it from you, he said. If he had not succeeded in wounding her \nwith his infidelity, he was cert ain the revelation of her riva l would do the trick. Looking \nher straight in the eye, he told her about Sabina. \nA while later he met Sabina at the airport. As the plane gained altitu de, he felt lighter \nand lighter. At last, he said to himself, after nine months he was living in truth. \nSabina felt as though Franz had pried open t he door of their privacy. As though she \nwere peering into the heads of Marie-Claude, of  Marie-Anne, of Alain the painter, of the \nsculptor who held on to his finger—of all the people she knew in Geneva. Now she \nwould willy-nilly become the rival of a woman who did not interest her in the least. Franz \nwould ask for a divorce, and she would take  Marie-Claude's place in  his large conjugal \nbed. Everyone would follow the process from a greater or lesser distance, and she \nwould be forced to playact before them all;  instead of being Sabina, she would have to \nact the role of Sabina, decide how best to  act the role. Once her love had been \npublicized, it would gain weight, become a burden. Sabina cr inged at the very thought \nof it. \nThey had supper at a restaurant in Rome. She drank her wine in silence. \nYou're not angry, are you? Franz asked. \nShe assured him she was not. She was sti ll confused and unsure whether to be happy \nor not. She recalled the time they met in the sleeping compartmen t of the Amsterdam \nexpress, the time she had want ed to go down on her knees  before him and beg him to \nhold her, squeeze her, never let her go. S he had longed to come to the end of the \ndangerous road of betrayals. She had longed to call a halt to it all. \nTry as she might to intensify that longing, summ on it to her aid, lean on it, the feeling of \ndistaste only grew stronger. \nThey walked back to the hotel through the streets of Rome. Because the Italians \naround them were making a racket, shouting and gesticulating, they could walk along in \nsilence without hearing their silence. \nSabina spent a long time washing in th e bathroom; Franz waited for her under the \nblanket. As always, the small lamp was lit. \nWhen she came out, she turned it off. It wa s the first time she had done so. Franz \nshould have paid better attention. He did not notice it, because light did not mean \nanything to him. As we know, he made love with his eyes shut. \nIn fact, it was his closed eyes that made S abina turn out the ligh t. She could not stand \nthose lowered eyelids a moment longer. The eyes, as the saying goes, are windows to \nthe soul. Franz's body, which thrashed ab out on top of hers with closed eyes, was \ntherefore a body without a soul. It was like a newborn animal, still blind and whimpering \nfor the dug. Muscular Franz in coitus was lik e a gigantic puppy suckling at her breasts. \nHe actually had her nipple in his mouth as if he were sucking milk! The idea that he was \na mature man below and a suckling infant above, that  she was therefore having \nintercourse with a baby, bordered on the dis gusting. No, she would never again see his\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 61\nbody moving desperately over her s, would never again offer him her breast, bitch to \nwhelp, today was the last time, irrevocably the last time! \nShe knew, of course, that she was being supremely unfair, that Franz was the best man \nshe had ever had—he was intelligent, he understood her paintings, he was handsome \nand good—but the more she thought about it, the more she longed to ravish his \nintelligence, defile his kindheartedness, and violate his powerless strength. \nThat night, she made love to him with great er frenzy than ever before, aroused by the \nrealization that this was the last time. Making love, she was far, far away. Once more \nshe heard the golden horn of betrayal beckoning her in the distance, and she knew she \nwould not hold out. She sensed an expa nse of freedom before her, and the \nboundlessness of it excited her. She made mad, unrestrained love to Franz as she \nnever had before. \nFranz sobbed as he lay on top of her; he was certain he understood: Sabina had been \nquiet all through dinner and said not a word about his decision, but this was her answer. \nShe had made a clear show of her joy, her passion, her consent, her desire to live with \nhim forever. \nHe felt like a rider galloping off into a magn ificent void, a void of no wife, no daughter, \nno household, the magnificent void swept clean by Hercules' broom, a magnificent void \nhe would fill with his love. \nEach was riding the other like a horse, and both were galloping off into the distance of \ntheir desires, drunk on the betrayals that freed them. Franz was riding Sabina and had \nbetrayed his wife; Sabina was riding Franz and had betrayed Franz. \nFor twenty years he had seen his mother—a  poor, weak creature who needed his \nprotection—in his wife. This image was d eeply rooted in him, and he could not rid \nhimself of it in two dys. On the way home his conscience began to bother him: he was \nafraid that Marie-Claude had fallen apart after he left and that he would find her terribly \nsick at heart. Stealthily he unlocked the door and went into his room. He stood there for \na moment and listened: Yes, she was at home. After a mo ment's hesitation he went \ninto her room, ready to greet her as usual. \nWhat? she exclaimed, raising her eyebrows in mock surprise. You? Here?  \nWhere else can I go? he wanted to say (genuinely surprised), but said nothing. \nLet's set the record straight, shall we? I have nothing against your moving in with her at \nonce.  \nWhen he made his confession on the day he le ft for Rome, he had no precise plan of \naction. He expected to come home and talk it all out in a friendly atmosphere so as not \nto harm Marie-Claude any more than necessa ry. It never occurred to him that she \nwould calmly and coolly urge him to leave.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 62\nEven though it facilitated things, he could not  help feeling disappointed. He had been \nafraid of wounding her all his life and volunt arily stuck to a stultifying discipline of \nmonogamy, and now, after twenty years, he suddenly learned that it had all been \nsuperfluous and he had given up scores of women because of a misunderstanding! \nThat afternoon, he gave his lect ure, then went straight to S abina's from the university. \nHe had decided to ask her whether he could spend the night. He rang the doorbell, but \nno one answered. He went and sat at the cafe across the street and stared long and \nhard at the entrance to her building. \nEvening came, and he did not know where to turn. All his life he had shared his bed \nwith Marie-Claude. If he went home to Marie-Claude, where should he sleep? He could, \nof course, make up a bed on the sofa in the next room. But wouldn't that be merely an \neccentric gesture? Wouldn't it look like a sign of ill will? He wanted to remain friends \nwith her, after all! Yet getting into bed with her  was out of the question. He could just \nhear her asking him ironically why he didn't pr efer Sabina's bed. He took a room in a \nhotel. \nThe next day, he rang Sabina's doorbell morning, noon, and night. \nThe day after, he paid a visit to the concie rge, who had no information and referred him \nto the owner of the flat. He phoned her and  found out that Sabi na had given notice two \ndays before. \nDuring the next few days, he retu rned at regular intervals, stil l hoping to find her in, but \none day he found the door open and three men in overalls loading the furniture and \npaintings into a van parked outside. \nHe asked them where they were taking the furniture. \nThey replied that they were under strict instructions not to reveal the address. \nHe was about to offer them a few francs for the secret address when suddenly he felt \nhe lacked the strength to do it. His grief had  broken him utterly. He understood nothing, \nhad no idea what had happened; all he knew was that he had been waiting for it to \nhappen ever since he met Sabina. What must be must be. Franz did not oppose it. \nHe found a small flat for himself in the old part of town. When he knew his wife and \ndaughter were away, he went back to his fo rmer home to fetch his clothes and most \nessential books. He was careful to remove nothing that Marie-Claude might miss. \nOne day, he saw her through the window of a cafe. She was sitting with two women, \nand her face, long riddled with wrinkles from  her unbridled gift for grimaces, was in a \nstate of animation. The wom en were listening closely and laughing continually. Franz \ncould not get over the feeling that she was telling them about him. Surely she knew that \nSabina had disappeared from Geneva at the ve ry time Franz decided to live with her. \nWhat a funny story it would make! He was not the least bit surprised at becoming a butt \nto his wife's friends."

    "raw_text": "\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 63\nWhen he got home to his new flat, where ever y hour he could hear the bells of Saint-\nPierre, he found that the depar tment store had delivered his new desk. He promptly \nforgot about Marie-Claude and her friends. He even forgot about Sabina for the time \nbeing. He sat down at the desk. He was glad  to have picked it out himself. For twenty \nyears he had lived among furniture not of hi s own choosing. Marie-Claude had taken \ncare of everything. At last he had ceased to be a little boy; for the first time in his life he \nwas on his own. The next day he hired a carpenter to make  a bookcase for him. He \nspent several days designing it and deciding where it should stand. \nAnd at some point, he realized to his great surprise that he was not particularly \nunhappy. Sabina's physical presence was much  less important than he had suspected. \nWhat was important was the golden footprint, the magic footprint she had left on his life \nand no one could ever remove. Just before disappearing from his horizon, she had \nslipped him Hercules' broom , and he had used it to sweep everything he despised out \nof his life. A sudden happiness, a feeling of bliss, the joy that came of freedom and a \nnew life—these were the gifts she had left him. \nActually, he had always preferred the unreal to the real. Just as he felt better at \ndemonstrations (which, as I have pointed out, are all playacting and dreams) than in a \nlecture hall full of students, so he was happi er with Sabina the invisible goddess than \nthe Sabina who had accompanied him th roughout the world and whose love he \nconstantly feared losing. By giving him the unexpected freedom of a man living on his \nown, she provided him with a halo of seductiveness. He became very attractive to \nwomen, and one of his students fell in love with him. \nAnd so within an amazingly short period the backdrop of his life had changed \ncompletely. Until recently he had lived in a large upper-middle-class flat with a servant, \na daughter, and a wife; now he liv ed in a tiny flat in the old part of town, where almost \nevery night he was joined by his young student-mistress. He did not need to squire her \nthrough the world from hotel to hotel; he could make love to her in his own flat, in his \nown bed, with his own books and ashtray on the bedside table! \nShe was a modest girl and not particularly pretty, but she admired Franz in the way \nFranz had only recently admired Sabina. He di d not find it unpleasant. And if he did \nperhaps feel that trading Sabina for a student with glasses wa s something for a \ncomedown, his innate goodness saw to it that he cared for he r and lavished on her the \npaternal love that had never had a true outlet before, given that Marie-Anne had always \nbehaved less like his daughter than like a copy of Marie-Claude. \nOne day, he paid a visit to his wife. He told her he would like to remarry. \nMarie-Claude shook her head. \nBut a divorce won't make any difference to you!  You won't lose a thing! I'll give you all \nthe property!  \nI don't care about property, she said. \nThen what do you care about?"

    "raw_text": "\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 64\nLove, she said with a smile. \nLove? Franz asked in amazement. \nLove is a battle, said Marie-Claude, still smili ng. And I plan to go on fighting. To the \nend.  \nLove is a battle? said Franz. Well, I don't feel at all like fighting. And he left. \nAfter four years in Geneva, Sabina settled in Paris, but she could not escape her \nmelancholy. If someone had asked her what  had come over her, she would have been \nhard pressed to find words for it. \nWhen we want to give expression to a dramat ic situation in our lives, we tend to use \nmetaphors of heaviness. We say that someth ing has become a great burden to us. We \neither bear the burden or fail  and go down with it, we struggle with it, win or lose. And \nSabina—what had come over her? Nothing. She had left a man because she felt like \nleaving him. Had he persecuted her? Had he tried to take revenge on her? No. Her \ndrama was a drama not of heaviness but of li ghtness. What fell to her lot was not the \nburden but the unbearable lightness of being. \nUntil that time, her betrayals had filled her with excitement and joy, because they \nopened up new paths to new  adventures of betrayal. But w hat if the paths came to an \nend? One could betray one's parents, hus band, country, love, but when parents \nhusband, country, and love were gone—what was left to betray? \nSabina felt emptiness all around  her. What if that empti ness was the goal of all her \nbetrayals? \nNaturally she had not realized it until now . How could she have? The goals we pursue \nare always veiled. A girl who longs for marriage longs for something she knows nothing \nabout. The boy who hankers after fame has no i dea what fame is. The thing that gives \nour every move its meaning is always tota lly unknown to us. Sabina was unaware of \nthe goal that lay behind her longing to betray. The unb earable lightness of being—was \nthat the goal? Her departure from Geneva brought her considerably closer to it. \nThree years after moving to Paris, she received a letter from Prague. It was from \nTomas's son. Somehow or other he had found out about her and got hold of her \naddress, and now he was writing to her as his father's closest friend. He informed her of \nthe deaths of Tomas and Tereza. For the past few years they had been living in a \nvillage, where Tomas was employed as a driver at a collective farm. From time to time \nthey would drive over to the next town and spend the night in a cheap hotel. The road \nthere wound through some hills, and their pickup had crashed and hurtled down a steep \nincline. Their bodie s had been crushed to a pulp. The police determined later that the \nbrakes were in disastrous condition. \nShe could not get over the news. The last link to her past had been broken.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 65\nAccording to her old habit, she decided to calm herself by taking a walk in a cemetery. \nThe Montparnasse Cemetery was the closest. It was all tiny houses, miniature chapels \nover each grave. Sabina could not underst and why the dead woul d want to have \nimitation palaces built over them. The cemetery was vanity  transmogrified into stone. \nInstead of growing more sensible in death, t he inhabitants of the cemetery were sillier \nthan they had been in life. Their monuments were meant to display how important they \nwere. There were no fathers, brothers, s ons, or grandmothers buri ed there, only public \nfigures, the bearers of titles, degrees, and h onors; even the postal clerk celebrated his \nchosen profession, his social significance—his dignity. \nWalking along a row of graves, she noticed people gathering for a burial. The funeral \ndirector had an armful of  flowers and was giving one to  each mourner. He handed one \nto Sabina as well. She joined the group. They made a detour past many monuments \nbefore they came to the grave, free for the moment of its heavy gravestone. She leaned \nover the hole. It was extrem ely deep. She dropped in  the flower. It sailed down to the \ncoffin in graceful somersaults. In Bohemia t he graves were not so  deep. In Paris the \ngraves were deeper, just as t he buildings were taller. Her eye fell on the stone, which \nlay next to the grave. It chilled her, and she hurried home. \nShe thought about that stone all day. Why had it horrified her so? \nShe answered herself: When graves are co vered with stones, the dead can no longer \nget out. \nBut the dead can't get out anyway! What difference does it make whether they're \ncovered with soil or stones? \nThe difference is that if a grave is cove red with a stone it means we don't want the \ndeceased to come back. The heavy stone tells the deceased, Stay where you are!  \nThat made Sabina think about her  father's grave. There wa s soil above his grave with \nflowers growing out of it and a maple tree reaching down to it, and the roots and flowers \noffered his corpse a path out of the grave.  If her father had been covered with a stone, \nshe would never have been able to communicate  with him after he died, and hear his \nvoice in the trees pardoning her. \nWhat was it like in the cemetery where Tereza and Tomas were buried? \nOnce more she started thinking about them. From time to time  they would drive over to \nthe next town and spend the night in a cheap hotel. That  passage in the letter had \ncaught her eye. It meant they were happy. And again she pictured Tomas as if he were \none of her paintings: Don Juan in the fo reground, a specious stage-set by a naive \npainter, and through a crack in the set—Trist an. He died as Trist an, not as Don Juan. \nSabina's parents had died in the same week . Tomas and Tereza in the same second. \nSuddenly she missed Franz terribly. \nWhen she told him about her cemetery walks,  he gave a shiver of disgust and called \ncemeteries bone and stone dumps. A gulf of misunderstanding had immediately\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 66\nopened between them. Not until that  day at the Montparnasse Cemetery did she see \nwhat he meant. She was sorry to have been so  impatient with him. Perhaps if they had \nstayed together longer, S abina and Franz would have begun to understand the words \nthey used. Gradually, timorously, their vo cabularies would have come together, like \nbashful lovers, and the music of one would have begun to intersect with the music of \nthe other. But it was too late now. \nYes, it was too late, and Sa bina knew she would leave Pa ris, move on, and on again, \nbecause were she to die here they would co ver her up with a stone, and in the mind of \na woman for whom no place is home the thought of an end to all flight is unbearable. \nAll Franz's friends knew about  Marie-Claude; they all knew  about the girl with the \noversized glasses. But no one knew about S abina. Franz was wrong when he thought \nhis wife had told her friends about her. Sabina was a beautiful woman, and Marie-\nClaude did not want people going about comparing their faces. \nBecause Franz was so afraid of being found out, he had never asked for any of \nSabina's paintings or drawings or even a s napshot of her. As a result, she disappeared \nfrom his life without a trace. There was not a scrap of tangible evidence to show that he \nhad spent the most wonderful year of his life with her. \nWhich only increased his desire to remain faithful to her. \nSometimes when they were alone in his flat together, the girl would lift her eyes from a \nbook, throw him an inquiring glance, and say, What are you thinking about?  \nSitting in his armchair, staring up at the ceiling, Franz always found some plausible \nresponse, but in fact he was thinking of Sabina. \nWhenever he published an arti cle in a scholarly journal, the girl was the first to read it \nand discuss it with him. But all he could think of was what  Sabina would have said \nabout it. Everything he did, he did for Sabina , the way Sabina would have liked to see it \ndone. \nIt was a perfectly innocent form of infide lity and one eminently suited to Franz, who \nwould never have done his bespectacled student-mistress any harm. He nourished the \ncult of Sabina more as religion than as love. \nIndeed, according to the theolog y of that religion it was Sabina who had sent him the \ngirl. Between his earthly love and his unearthly love, therefore, there was perfect peace. \nAnd if unearthly love must (for theological reasons) cont ain a strong dose of the \ninexplicable and incomprehensible (we hav e only to recall the dictionary of \nmisunderstood words and the long lexicon of  misunderstandings!), his earthly love \nrested on true understanding. \nThe student-mistress was much younger than Sabina, and the musical composition of \nher life had scarcely been outlined; she was grateful to Franz for the motifs he gave her \nto insert. Franz's Grand March was now her creed as well. Music was now her \nDionysian intoxication. They often went danc ing together. They liv ed in truth, and\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 67\nnothing they did was secret. They sought out the com pany of friends, colleagues, \nstudents, and strangers, and enjoyed sitting, dr inking, and chatting with them. They \ntook frequent excursions to the Alps. Franz would bend over, the girl hopped onto his \nback, and off he ran through the meadows, declaiming at the top of his voice a long \nGerman poem his mother had taught him as  a child. The girl laughed with glee, \nadmiring his legs, shoulders, and lungs as she clasped his neck. \nThe only thing she could not quite fathom  was the curious sympathy he had for the \ncountries occupied by the Russian empire. On the anniversary of  the invasion, they \nattended a memorial meeting organized by a Czech group in Geneva. \nThe room was nearly empty. The speaker had artificially waved gray hair. He read out a \nlong speech that bored even the few enthusias ts who had come to hear it. His French \nwas grammatically correct but heavily accented. From time to time, to stress a point, he \nwould raise his index finger, as if threatening the audience. \nThe girl with the glasses could barely suppre ss her yawns, while Franz smiled blissfully \nat her side. The longer he l ooked at the pleasing gray-haired man with the admirable \nindex finger, the more he saw him as a secret messenger, an  angelic intermediary \nbetween him and his goddess. He closed his eyes and dreamed. He closed his eyes as \nhe had closed them on Sabina's body in fifteen European hotels and one in America. \nPART FOUR \nSoul and Body \nWhen Tereza came home, it was almost half past one in the morning. She went into the \nbathroom, put on her pajamas, and lay down next to Tomas. He was asleep. She \nleaned over his face and, kissing it, detected a curious aroma coming from his hair. She \ntook another whiff and yet another. She sn iffed him up and down like a dog before \nrealizing what it was: the aroma of a woman's sex organs. \nAt six the alarm went off. Karenin's great moment had arrived. He always woke up \nmuch earlier than they did, but did not dare to disturb them. He would wait impatiently \nfor the alarm, because it gave him the right to jump up on their bed, trample their \nbodies, and butt them with his muzzle. For a time they had tried to curb him and pushed \nhim off the bed, but he was more headstr ong than they were and ended by defending \nhis rights. Lately, Tereza realized, she positively enjoyed being welcomed into the day \nby Karenin. Waking up was sheer delight for him: he always showed a naive and simple \namazement at the discovery that he was back on earth; he was sincerely pleased. She, \non the other hand, awoke with gr eat reluctance with a desire to stave off the day by \nkeeping her eyes closed. \nNow he was standing in the entrance hall, gazin g up at the hat stan d, where his leash \nand collar hung ready. She sl ipped his head through the co llar, and off they went \ntogether to do the shopping. She needed to pick up some milk, butter, and bread and, \nas usual, his morning roll. Later, he trott ed back alongside her, ro ll in mouth, looking \nproudly from side to side, gratified by the attention he attracted from the passersby."

    "raw_text": "\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 68\nOnce home, he would stretch out with his roll on the thre shold of the bedroom and wait \nfor Tomas to take notice of him, creep up to him, snarl at him, and make believe he was \ntrying to snatch his roll away from him. Th at was how it went ev ery day. Not until they \nhad chased each other through the flat for at least five minutes would Karenin scramble \nunder a table and gobble up the roll. \nThis time, however, he waited in vain for his morning ritual. Tomas had a small \ntransistor radio on the table in front of him and was listening to it intently. \nIt was a program about the Czech emigrati on, a montage of priv ate conversations \nrecorded with the latest bugging devices by a Czech spy who had infiltrated the emigre \ncommunity and then returned in great glory to Prague. It was insignificant prattle dotted \nwith some harsh words about the occupati on regime, but here and there one emigre \nwould call another an imbecile or a fraud. These trivial remarks were the point of the \nbroadcast. They were meant to prove not merely that emigres had bad things to say \nabout the Soviet Union (which neither surprised nor upset anyone in the country), but \nthat they call one anot her names and make free use of di rty words. People use filthy \nlanguage all day long, but when they turn on the r adio and hear a well-known \npersonality, someone they respect, saying fuck in every sentence, they feel somehow \nlet down. \nIt all started with Prochazka, said Tomas. \nJan Prochazka, a forty-year-old Czech novelist with the strength and vitality of an ox, \nbegan criticizing public affairs vociferously  even before 1968. He then became one of \nthe best-loved figures of t he Prague Spring, that dizzying li beralization of Communism \nwhich ended with the Russian invasion. Shortl y after the invasion the press initiated a \nsmear campaign against him, but the more  they smeared, the more people liked him. \nThen (in 1970, to be exact) the Czech radio broadcast a series of private talks between \nProchazka and a professor friend of his which had taken place two years before (that is, \nin the spring of 1968). For a long time, neither of them had any  idea that the professor's \nflat was bugged and their every step dogged. Prochazka loved to regale his friends with \nhyperbole and excess. Now his excesses had become a weekly radio series. The \nsecret police, who produced and directed the show, took pains to emphasize the \nsequences in which Prochazka made fun of his friends—Dubce k, for instance. People \nslander their friends at the drop of a hat, but  they were more shocked by the much-\nloved Prochazka than by the much-hated secret police. \nTomas turned off the radio and said, Every c ountry has its secret police. But a secret \npolice that broadcasts its tapes over the radio—there's something that could happen \nonly in Prague, something absolutely without precedent!  \nI know a precedent, said Tereza. When I was fourteen I kept a se cret diary. I was \nterrified that someone might read it so I kept it  hidden in the attic. Mother sniffed it out. \nOne day at dinner, while we were all hunched over our soup, she t ook it out of her \npocket and said, 'Listen carefully now, every body!' And after every sentence, she burst \nout laughing. They all laughed so hard they couldn't eat.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 69\nHe always tried to get her to  stay in bed and let him hav e breakfast alone. She never \ngave in. Tomas was at work from seven to f our, Tereza from four to midnight. If she \nwere to miss breakfast with him, the only time  they could actually talk together was on \nSundays. That was why she got up when he did and then went back to bed. \nThis morning, however, she was afraid of going back to sleep, because at ten she was \ndue at the sauna on Zofin Island. The s auna, though coveted by  the many, could \naccommodate only the few, and the only way to get in was by pull. Luckily, the cashier \nwas the wife of a professor removed from the university after 1968 and the professor a \nfriend of a former patient of Tomas's. Tomas told the patient, the patient told the profes-\nsor, the professor told his wife, and Tereza had a ticket waiting for her once a week. \nShe walked there. She detes ted the trams constantly pa cked with people pushing into \none another's hate-filled embraces, stepping on one another's feet, tearing off one \nanother's coat buttons, and shouting insults. \nIt was drizzling. As people rushed along, they began opening umbrellas over their \nheads, and all at once the streets were cr owded, too. Arched umbrella roofs collided \nwith one another. The men were courteous, and when passing Tereza they held their \numbrellas high over their heads and gave her room to go by. But the women would not \nyield; each looked straight ahead, waiting for the other woman to acknowledge her \ninferiority and step aside. The m eeting of the umbrellas was a test of strength. At first \nTereza gave way, but when she realized her courtesy was not being reciprocated, she \nstarted clutching her umbrella like the ot her women and ramming it forcefully against \nthe oncoming umbrellas. No one ever said Sorry. For t he most part no one said \nanything, though once or twice she did hear a Fat cow! or Fuck you!  \nThe women thus armed with umbrellas were both young an d old, but the younger \namong them proved the more steeled warriors. Tereza recalled the days of the invasion \nand the girls in miniskirts carrying flags on lo ng staffs. Theirs was a sexual vengeance: \nthe Russian soldiers had been kept in enforced celibacy for several long years and \nmust have felt they had landed on a planet in vented by a science fiction writer, a planet \nof stunning women who paraded their scorn on beautiful lo ng legs the likes of which \nhad not been seen in Russia for the past five or six centuries. \nShe had taken many pictures of those young women against a backdrop of tanks. How \nshe had admired them! And now these same women were bumping into her, meanly \nand spitefully. Instead of flags, they held umbr ellas, but they held them with the same \npride. They were ready to fight as obs tinately against a foreign army as against an \numbrella that refused to move out of their way. \nShe came out into Old Town Square—the st ern spires of Tyn Church, the irregular \nrectangle of Gothic and baroque houses. Old Town Hall, which dated from the \nfourteenth century and had once stretched over a whole side of the square, was in ruins \nand had been so for twenty-seven years. Wa rsaw, Dresden, Berlin, Cologne, \nBudapest—all were horribly scarred in the last  war. But their inhabi tants had built them \nup again and painstakingly rest ored the old historical sect ions. The people of Prague \nhad an inferiority complex with respect to these other cities. Old Town Hall was the only\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 70\nmonument of note destroyed in th e war, and they decided to l eave it in ruins so that no \nPole or German could accuse them of having suffered less than their share. In front of \nthe glorious ruins, a reminder for now and eternity of the evils perpetrated by war, stood \na steel-bar reviewing stand for some demonstr ation or other that the Communist Party \nhad herded the people of Prague to the day before or would be herding them to the day \nafter. \nGazing at the remains of Old Town Hall, Te reza was suddenly reminded of her mother: \nthat perverse need one has to expose one' s ruins, one's ugliness, to parade one's \nmisery, to uncover the stump of one's amputa ted arm and force the whole world to look \nat it. Everything had begun remindi ng her of her mother late ly. Her mother's world, \nwhich she had fled ten years before, seemed to be coming back to her, surrounding her \non all sides. That was why she told Tomas that morning about how her mother had \nread her secret diary at t he dinner table to an accom paniment of guffaws. When a \nprivate talk over a bottle of wine is broadcast on the radio, what can it mean but that the \nworld is turning into a concentration camp? \nAlmost from childhood, Tereza had used the term to express how she felt about life with \nher family. A concentration camp is a world in which people live crammed together con-\nstantly, night and day. Brutality and violence ar e merely secondary (and not in the least \nindispensable) characteristics. A concentrat ion camp is the complete obliteration of \nprivacy. Prochazka, who was not allowed to chat with a friend over  a bottle of wine in \nthe shelter of privacy, lived (unknown to him—a fatal error on his part!) in a \nconcentration camp. Tereza lived in the c oncentration camp when she lived with her \nmother. Almost from childhood, she knew that a concentration camp was nothing \nexceptional or start ling but something very basic, a given into which we are born and \nfrom which we can escape only with the greatest of efforts. \nThe women sitting on the thr ee terraced benches were packed in so tightly that they \ncould not help touching. Sweati ng away next to Tereza wa s a woman of about thirty \nwith a very pretty face. She had two unbel ievably large, pendu lous breasts hanging \nfrom her shoulders, bouncing at the sli ghtest movement. When the woman got up, \nTereza saw that her behind was also like two enormous sacks and that it had nothing in \ncommon with her fine face. \nPerhaps the woman stood frequently in front of  the mirror observing her body, trying to \npeer through it into her soul, as Tereza had  done since childhood. Surely she, too, had \nharbored the blissful hope of using her body as a poste r for her soul. But what a \nmonstrous soul it would have to be if it reflected that body, that rack for four pouches. \nTereza got up and rinsed herself off under the shower. Then she went out into the \nopen. It was still drizzling. Standing just above the Vlta va on a slatted deck, and \nsheltered from the eyes of the city by a few square feet of tall wooden panel, she \nlooked down to see the head  of the woman she had ju st been thinking about. It was \nbobbing on the surface of the rushing river. \nThe woman smiled up at her. She had a delicate nose, large brown eyes, and a childish \nglance.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 71\nAs she climbed the ladder, her tender featur es gave way to two sets of quivering \npouches spraying tiny drops of cold water right and left. \nTereza went in to get dressed and stood in front of the large mirror. \nNo, there was nothing monstrous about her body. She had no pouc hes hanging from \nher shoulders; in fact, her breasts were quite small. Her mother used to ridicule her for \nhaving such small breasts, and she had had a complex about them  until Tomas came \nalong. But reconciled to their size as she was, she was still mortified by the very large, \nvery dark circles around her nipples. H ad she been able to design her own body, she \nwould have chosen inconspicuous nipples, the kind that scarcely protrude from the arch \nof the breast and all but blend in color with the rest  of the skin. She thought of her \nareolae as big crimson targets painted by a primitivist of pornography for the poor. \nLooking at herself, she wondered what she would be like if her nose grew a millimeter a \nday. How long would it take before her face began to look like someone else's? \nAnd if various parts of her body began to grow and shrink and Tereza no longer looked \nlike herself, would she still be herself, would she still be Tereza? \nOf course. Even if Tereza were completely un like Tereza, her soul inside her would be \nthe same and look on in amazement at what was happening to her body. \nThen what was the relationship between Te reza and her body? Had her body the right \nto call itself Tereza? And if  not, then what did the name refer to? Merely something \nincorporeal, intangible? \n(These are questions that had been going through Tereza's head since she was a child. \nIndeed, the only truly serious questions are ones that even a child can formulate. Only \nthe most naive of questions are truly seri ous. They are the questions with no answers. \nA question with no answer is a barrier that cannot be breache d. In other words, it is \nquestions with no answers th at set the limits of human possibilities, describe the \nboundaries of human existence.) \nTereza stood bewitched bef ore the mirror, staring at her body as if it were alien to her, \nalien and yet assigned to her and no one else. She felt disgusted by it. It lacked the \npower to become the only body in Tomas's lif e. It had disappointed  and deceived her. \nAll that night she had had to inhale the aroma of another woman's groin from his hair! \nSuddenly she longed to dismiss her body as one dismisses a servant: to stay on with \nTomas only as a soul and send her body into the world to behave as other female \nbodies behave with male bodies. If her body had failed to become the only body for \nTomas, and thereby lost her the biggest battle of her life, it could just as well go off on \nits own! \nShe went home and forced herself  to eat a stand-up lunch in the kitchen. At half past \nthree, she put Karenin on his leash and walked (w alking again) to the outskirts of town \nwhere her hotel was. When they  fired Tereza from her job at the magazine, she found \nwork behind the bar of a hotel. It happened several months after she came back from\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 72\nZurich: they could not forgive her, in t he end, for the week sh e spent photographing \nRussian tanks. She got the job through fr iends, other people who had taken refuge \nthere when thrown out of work by the Russi ans: a former professor of theology in the \naccounting office, an ambassador (who had pr otested against the invasion on foreign \ntelevision) at the reception desk. \nShe was worried about her legs again. While working as a waitress in the small-town \nrestaurant, she had been horrified at the sight of the older waitresses' varicose veins, a \nprofessional hazard that ca me of a life of walking, running, and standing with heavy \nloads. But the new job was less demanding: although she began each shift by dragging \nout heavy cases of beer and mineral water, all she had to do then was stand behind the \nbar, serve the customers their drinks, and wash out the glasses in the small sink on her \nside of the bar. And through it all she had Karenin lying docilely at her feet. \nIt was long past midnight before she had fini shed her accounts and delivered the cash \nreceipts to the hotel director. She then w ent to say good-bye to the ambassador, who \nhad night duty. The door behind the reception de sk led to a tiny room with a narrow cot \nwhere he could take a nap. The wall above the cot was covered with framed \nphotographs of himself and various people smiling at the camera or shaking his hand or \nsitting next to him at a table and signing something or other. Some of them were \nautographed. In the place of honor hung a picture showing, side by side with his own \nface, the smiling face of John F. Kennedy. \nWhen Tereza entered the room that night, she found him talking not to Kennedy but to \na man of about sixty whom she had never seen before and who fell silent as soon as he \nsaw her. \nIt's all right, said the ambassador. She's a friend. You can speak freel y in front of her. \nThen he turned to Tereza. His son got five years today.  \nDuring the first days of the invasion, she learned, the man's son and some friends had \nstood watch over the entrance to a building housing the Russian army special staff. \nSince any Czechs they saw coming or going were clearly agents in the service of the \nRussians, he and his friends trailed them, tr aced the number plates of their cars, and \npassed on the information to the pro- Dubcek clandestine radio and television \nbroadcasters, who then warned the public. In  the process the boy and his friends had \ngiven one of the traitors a thorough going over. \nThe boy's father said, This photograph was t he only corpus delicti. He denied it all until \nthey showed it to him.  \nHe took a clipping out of his wallet. It came out in the Times in the autumn of 1968.  \nIt was a picture of a young man grabbing another man by the throat and a crowd \nlooking on in the background. Collaborator Punished read the caption. \nTereza let out her breath. No, it wasn't one of hers.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 73\nWalking home with Karenin through nocturnal Prague, she thought of the days she had \nspent photographing tanks. How naive they had been, thinking they were risking their \nlives for their country when in fact they were helping the Russian police. \nShe got home at half past one. Tomas was asleep. His hair gave off the aroma of a \nwoman's groin. \nWhat is flirtation? One might say that it is behavior leading  another to believe that \nsexual intimacy is possible, while preventing that possibilit y from becoming a certainty. \nIn other words, flirting is a promise of sexual intercourse without a guarantee. \nWhen Tereza stood behind the ba r, the men whose drinks she poured flirted with her. \nWas she annoyed by t he unending ebb and flow of flat tery, double entendres, off-color \nstories, propositions, smiles,  and glances? Not in the l east. She had an irresistible \ndesire to expose her body (that alien body she wanted to expe l into the big wide world) \nto the undertow. \nTomas kept trying to convince her that love  and lovemaking were two different things. \nShe refused to understand. Now she was surrounded by men she did not care for in the \nslightest. What would making love with them be like? She yearned to try it, if only in the \nform of that no-guarantee promise called flirting. \nLet there be no mistake: Tereza did not wish  to take revenge on Tomas; she merely \nwished to find a way out of the maze. She knew that she had become a burden to him: \nshe took things too seriously, turning ever ything into a tragedy, and failed to grasp the \nlightness and amusing insignifi cance of physical love. How she wished she could learn \nlightness! She yearned for someone to help her out of her anachronistic shell. \nIf for some women flirting is second nature, insignificant, routine, for Tereza it had \ndeveloped into an important field of research with the goal of teaching her who she was \nand what she was capable of. But by making it important and serious, she deprived it of \nits lightness, and it became forced, labored, overdone.  She disturbed the balance \nbetween promise and lack of guarantee (which, w hen maintained, is a sign of flirtistic \nvirtuosity); she promised t oo ardently, and without making it  clear that the promise \ninvolved no guarantee on her part. Which is  another way of saying that she gave \neveryone the impression of being there fo r the taking. But when men responded by \nasking for what they felt they had been promised, they me t with strong resistance, and \ntheir only explanation for it was that she was deceitful and malicious. \nOne day, a boy of a bout sixteen perched himself on a bar stool and dropped a few \nprovocative phrases that st ood out in the general  conversation like a false line in a \ndrawing, a line that can be neither continued nor erased. \nThat's some pair of legs you've got there.  \nSo you can see through wood! she fired back.  I've watched you in the street, he \nresponded, but by then she had turned away  and was serving another customer. When \nshe had finished, he ordered a cognac. She shook her head. But I'm eighteen! he \nobjected. May I see your identification card? Tereza said. You may not, the boy\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 74\nanswered. Then how about a soft drink? said Tereza. Without a word, the boy stood up \nfrom the bar stool and left. He was back about a half hour later. With exaggerated \ngestures, he took a seat at the bar. Ther e was enough alcohol on hi s breath to cover a \nten-foot radius. Give me that soft drink, he commanded. \nWhy, you're drunk! said Tereza. The boy pointed to a sign hanging on the wall behind \nTereza's back: Sale of Alcoholic Beverages to Minors Is Strictly Prohibited. You are \nprohibited from serving me alcohol, he said , sweeping his arm from the sign to Tereza, \nbut I am not prohibited from being drunk.  \nWhere did you get so drunk? Tereza asked.  In the bar across the street, he said, \nlaughing, and asked again for a soft drink. \nWell, why didn't you stay there? Because I want ed to look at you, he said. I love you! \nHis face contorted oddly as he said it, and Tereza had trouble deciding whether he was \nsneering, making advances, or joking. Or was he simply so  drunk that he had no idea \nwhat he was saying? \nShe put the soft drink down in front of him and went back to her ot her customers. The I \nlove you! seemed to have exhausted the boy 's resources. He emptied his glass in \nsilence, left money on the counter, and slipped out before Tereza had time to look up \nagain. \nA moment after he left, a s hort, bald-headed man,  who was on his third vodka, said, \nYou ought to know that serving young people alcohol is against the law.  \nI didn't serve him alcohol! That was a soft drink!  \nI saw what you slipped into it!  \nWhat are you talking about?  \nGive me another vodka, said the bald ma n, and added, I've had my eye on you for \nsome time now.  \nThen why not be grateful for the view of a beautiful woman and k eep your mouth shut? \ninterjected a tall man who had stepped up to  the bar in time to  observe the entire \nscene. \nYou stay out of this! shouted the bald man. What business is it of yours?  \nAnd what business is it of yours, if I may ask? the tall man retorted. \nTereza served the bald man his vodka. He downed it at one gulp, paid, and departed. \nThank you, said Tereza to the tall man. \nDon't mention it, said the tall man, and went his way, too.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 75\nA few days later, he turned up at the bar again. When she saw him, she smiled at him \nlike a friend. Thanks again. T hat bald fellow comes in all the time. He's terribly \nunpleasant.  \nForget him.  \nWhat makes him want to hurt me?  \nHe's a petty little drunk. Forget him.  \nIf you say so.  \nThe tall man looked in her eyes. Promise?  \nI promise.  \nI like hearing you make me promises, he said, still looking in her eyes. \nThe flirtation was on: the behavior leading another  to believe that sexual intimacy is \npossible, even though the possibility itself remains in the realm of theory, in suspense. \nWhat's a beautiful girl like you doing in the ugliest part of Prague?  \nAnd you? she countered. What are you doing in the ugliest part of Prague?  \nHe told her he lived nearby. He was an en gineer and had stopped off on his way home \nfrom work the other day by sheer chance. \nWhen Tereza looked at Tomas, her eyes went not to his ey es but to a point three or \nfour inches higher, to his hair, which gave off the aroma of other women's groins. \nI can't take it anymore, Tomas. I know I sh ouldn't complain. Ever since you came back \nto Prague for me, I've forbidden myself to be jealous. I don't want to be jealous. I \nsuppose I'm just not strong enough to stand up to it. Help me, please!  \nHe put his arm in hers and took her to the park where years before they had gone on \nfrequent walks. The park had red, blue, and yellow benches. They sat down. \nI understand you. I know what you want, said Tomas. I've taken care of everything. All \nyou have to do is climb Petrin Hill.  \nPetrin Hill? She felt a surge of anxiety. Why Petrin Hill?  \nYou'll see when you get up there.  \nShe was terribly upset about the idea of goi ng. Her body was so weak that she could \nscarcely lift it off the bench. But she was co nstitutionally unable to disobey Tomas. She \nforced herself to stand. \nShe looked back. He was still sitting on the bench, smiling at her almost cheerfully. With \na wave of the hand he signaled her to move on.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 76\nComing out at the foot of Pe trin Hill, that gr eat green mound rising up in the middle of \nPrague, she was surprised to find it devoid of people. This was strange, because at \nother times half of Prague seemed to be milli ng about. It made her anxious. But the hill \nwas so quiet and the quiet so comforting that she yielded full y to its embrace. On her \nway up, she paused several times to look back: below her she saw the towers and \nbridges; the saints were shaking their fist s and lifting their stone eyes to the clouds. It \nwas the most beautiful city in the world. \nAt last she reached the top.  Beyond the ice-cream and souvenir stands (none of which \nhappened to be open) stretched a broad lawn spotted here and there with trees. She \nnoticed several men on the lawn. The closer she came to them, the slower she walked. \nThere were six in all. They were standing or strolling along at  a leisurely pace like \ngolfers looking over the course and weighing various clubs in their hands, trying to get \ninto the proper frame of mind for a match. \nShe finally came near them. Of the six men, three were there to play the same role as \nshe: they were unsettled; t hey seemed eager to ask all so rts of questions, but feared \nmaking nuisances of themselves and so he ld their tongues and merely looked about \ninquisitively. \nThe other three radiated condescending benev olence. One of them had a rifle in his \nhand. Spotting Tereza, he waved at her and said with a smile, Yes, this is the place.  \nShe gave a nod in reply, but still felt extremely anxious. \nThe man added: To avoid an error, this was your choice, wasn t it? \nIt would have been easy to say,  No, no! It wasn't my choice  at all! but she could not \nimagine disappointing Tomas. What excuse, what apology could she find for going back \nhome? And so she said, Yes, of course. It was my choice.  \nThe man with the rifle continued:  Let me explain why I wish to know. The only time we \ndo this is when we are certai n that the people who come to  us have chosen to die of \ntheir own accord. We consider it a service.  \nHe gave her so quizzical a glance that she had to assure him once more: No, no, don't \nworry. It was my choice.  \nWould you like to go first? he asked. \nBecause she wanted to put off the executi on as long as she could, she said, No, \nplease, no. If it's at all possible, I'd like to be last.  \nAs you please, he said, and went off to the ot hers. Neither of his assistants was armed; \ntheir sole function was to attend to the people who were to die. They took them by the \narms and walked them across the lawn. The grassy surface proved quite an expanse; it \nran as far as the eye could see. The people to be executed were allowed to choose \ntheir own trees. They paused at  each one and looked it over carefully, unable to make \nup their minds. Two of them eventually chose plane trees, but the third wandered on\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 77\nand on, no tree apparently striking him as wort hy of his death. The assistant who held \nhim by the arm guided him along gently and patiently until at last the man lost the \ncourage to go on and stopped at a luxuriant maple. \nThen the assistants blindfolded all three men. \nAnd so three men, their eyes blindfolded, their heads turned to the sky, stood with their \nbacks against three trees on the endless lawn. \nThe man with the rifle took aim and fired. There was nothing to be heard but the singing \nof birds: the rifle was equipped with a silencing device. There was nothing to be seen \nbut the collapse of the man who had been leaning against the maple. \nWithout taking a step, the man with the rifle turned in a di fferent direction, and one of \nthe other men silently crumpl ed. And seconds later (again the man with the rifle merely \nturned in place), the third man sank to the lawn. \nOne of the assistants went up to Tereza; he was holding a dark-blue ribbon. \nShe realized he had come to blindfold her. No , she said, shaking her head, I want to \nwatch.  \nBut that was not the real reason why she refused to be blindfolded. She was not one of \nthose heroic types who are determined to stare down the firing squad. She simply \nwanted to postpone death. Once her eyes we re covered, she would be in death's \nantechamber, from which there was no return. \nThe man did not force her; he merely took her arm. But as they walked across the open \nlawn, Tereza was unable to choose a tree.  No one forced her to hurry, but she knew \nthat in the end she would not  escape. Seeing a flowering chestnut ahead of her, she \nwalked up and stopped in front of it. She leaned her back against its trunk and looked \nup. She saw the leaves respl endent in the sun; she heard the sounds of the city, faint \nand sweet, like thousands of distant violins. \nThe man raised his rifle. \nTereza felt her courage slipping away. He r weakness drove her to despair, but she \ncould do nothing to counteract it. But it wasn't my choice, she said. \nHe immediately lowered the barrel of his rifle and said in a gentle voice, If it wasn't your \nchoice, we can't do it. We haven't the right.  \nHe said it kindly, as if apolog izing to Tereza for not being ab le to shoot her if it was not \nher choice. His kindness tore at her heartstr ings, and she turned her face to the bark of \nthe tree and burst into tears. \nHer whole body racked with sobs, she embraced the tree as if it were not  a tree, as if it \nwere her long-lost father, a grandfather she had never k nown, a great-grandfather, a \ngreat-great-grandfather, a hoary ol d man come to her from the depths of time to offer \nher his face in the form of rough tree bark."

    "raw_text": "\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 78\nThen she turned her head. The three men were far off in the distance by then, \nwandering across the greensward like golfers. The one with the rifle even held it like a \ngolf club. \nWalking down the paths of Petrin Hill, she could not w ean her thoughts from the man \nwho was supposed to shoot her but did not. Oh, how she longed for him! Someone had \nto help her, after all! Tomas wouldn't. Toma s was sending her to her death. Someone \nelse would have to help her! \nThe closer she got to the city, the more she longed for the man with the rifle and the \nmore she feared Tomas. He would never forgive her for failing to keep her word. He \nwould never forgive her her cowardice, her betrayal. She had come to the street where \nthey lived, and knew she would see him in a minute or two. She was so afraid of seeing \nhim that her stomach was in knots and she thought she was going to be sick. \nThe engineer started trying to lure her up to his flat. She refused the first two invitations, \nbut accepted the third. \nAfter her usual stand-up lunch in the kitchen, she set off. It was just before two. \nAs she approached his house, she could feel  her legs slowing down of their own \naccord. \nBut then it occurred to her that she was actually being sent to him by Tomas. Hadn't he \ntold her time and again that love and sexuality had nothing  in common? Well, she was \nmerely testing his words, confirming them. She could almost hear him say, I understand \nyou. I know what you want. I've taken care of everything. You'll see when you get up \nthere.  \nYes, all she was doing was following Tomas's commands. \nShe wouldn't stay long; long enough for a cup of coffee; long enough to feel what it was \nlike to reach the very border of  infidelity. She would push her body up to the border, let \nit stand there for a moment as at the stake, and then, when the engineer tried to put his \narms around her, she would say, as she said to the man with the rifle on Petrin Hill, It \nwasn't my choice.  \nWhereupon the man would lower the barrel of his rifle and say in a gentle voice, If it \nwasn't your choice, I can't do it. I haven't the right.  \nAnd she would turn her face to the bark of the tree and burst into tears. \nThe building had been constructed at the turn of the century in a workers' district of \nPrague. She entered a hall with dirty whitewashed walls, climbed a flight of worn stone \nstairs with iron banisters, and turned to the left. It was the second door, no name, no \nbell. She knocked. \nHe opened the door.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 79\nThe entire flat consisted of a single room with a curtain setting off the first five or six feet \nfrom the rest and therefore forming a kind of makeshif t anteroom. It had a table, a hot \nplate, and a refrigerator. St epping beyond the curtain, she saw the oblong of a window \nat the end of a long, na rrow space, with books along one side and a daybed and \narmchair against the other. \nIt's a very simple place I have here, said  the engineer. I hope you don't find it \ndepressing.  \nNo, not at all, said Tereza, looking at t he wall covered with bookshelves. He had no \ndesk, but hundreds of books. She liked seei ng them, and the anxiety that had plagued \nher died down somewhat. Fr om childhood, she had regarded books as the emblems of \na secret brotherhood. A man with this sort of library couldn't possibly hurt her. \nHe asked her what she'd like to drink. Wine? \nNo, no, no wine. Coffee, if anything. \nHe disappeared behind the curtai n, and she went over to t he bookshelves. One of the \nbooks caught her eye at once. It was a translation of Sophocles' Oedipus.  How odd to \nfind it here! Years ago, Tomas had given it to her, and after she had read it he went on \nand on about it. Then he sent his reflections to a newspaper, and the article turned their \nlife upside down. But now, just looking at t he spine of the book seemed to calm her. It \nmade her feel as though Tomas had purposel y left a trace, a message that her \npresence here was his doing. She took the book  off the shelf and op ened it. When the \ntall engineer came back into the room, sh e would ask him why he had it, whether he \nhad read it, and what he thought of it. That would be her ruse to turn the conversation \naway from the hazardous terrain of a stranger's  flat to the intimate world of Tomas's \nthoughts. \nThen she felt his hand on her s houlder. The man took the b ook out of her hand, put it \nback on the shelf without a word, and led her over to the daybed. \nAgain she recalled the words she had used wit h the Petrin executioner, and said them \naloud: But it wasn't my choice!  \nShe believed them to be a miraculous formula that would instantly change the situation, \nbut in that room the words lost their magic power. I have a feeling they even \nstrengthened the man in his resolve: he pre ssed her to himself and put his hand on her \nbreast. \nOddly enough, the touch of his hand immediately erased what remained of her anxiety. \nFor the engineer's hand referred to her body,  and she realized that she (her soul) was \nnot at all involved, only her body, her body  alone. The body that had betrayed her and \nthat she had sent out into the world among other bodies. \nHe undid the first button on her blouse and i ndicated she was to continue. She did not \ncomply. She had sent her body out into the world, and refused to take any responsibility\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 80\nfor it. She neither resisted nor assisted him, her soul thereby announcing that it did not \ncondone what was happening but had decided to remain neutral. \nShe was nearly immobile while he undressed her. When he kissed her, her lips failed to \nreact. But suddenly she felt her groin becoming moist, and she was afraid. \nThe excitement she felt was all the greater  because she was excited against her will. In \nother words, her soul did c ondone the proceedings, albeit co vertly. But she also knew \nthat if the feeling of excitement was to continue, her soul's  approval would have to keep \nmute. The moment it said its yes aloud, the mo ment it tried to take an active part in the \nlove scene, the excitement w ould subside. For what made t he soul so excited was that \nthe body was acting against its will; the body was betraying it, and the soul was looking \non. \nThen he pulled off her panties and she was co mpletely naked. When her soul saw her \nnaked body in the arms of a stranger, it was so  incredulous that it might as well have \nbeen watching the planet Mars at close range. In the light of the incredible, the soul for \nthe first time saw the body as something other  than banal; for the first time it looked on \nthe body with fascination: all the body's matc hless, inimitable, unique qualities had \nsuddenly come to the fore. This was not the most ordinary of bodi es (as the soul had \nregarded it until then); this was the most extr aordinary body. The soul could not tear its \neyes away from the body's bi rthmark, the round brown blem ish above its hairy triangle. \nIt looked upon that mark as its seal, a holy seal it had imprinted on the body, and now a \nstranger's penis was moving blasphemously close to it. \nPeering into the engineer's fa ce, she realized that she would never allow her body, on \nwhich her soul had left its mark, to take  pleasure in the embrace of someone she \nneither knew nor wished to know. She wa s filled with an intoxicating hatred. She \ncollected a gob of saliva to spit in the st ranger's face. He was observing her with as \nmuch eagerness as she him, and noting her rage, he quickened the pace of his \nmovements on her body. Tereza could feel  orgasm advancing from afar, and shouted \nNo, no, no! to resist it, but resisted, cons trained, deprived of an outlet, the ecstasy \nlingered all the longer in her body, flowing through her veins like a shot of morphine. \nShe thrashed in his arms, swung her fists in the air, and spat in his face. \nToilets in modern water closets rise up from the floor like white water lilies. The \narchitect does all he can to make the body forget how paltry it is, and to make man \nignore what happens to his intestinal wastes a fter the water from the tank flushes them \ndown the drain. Even though t he sewer pipelines reach far into our houses with their \ntentacles, they are carefully hidden from  view, and we are happily ignorant of the \ninvisible Venice of shit  underlying our bathrooms, bed rooms, dance halls, and parlia-\nments. \nThe bathroom in the old working-class flat on the outskirts of Prague was less \nhypocritical: the floor was covered with gray  tile and the toilet ri sing up from it was \nbroad, squat, and pitiful. It did not look like a wh ite water lily; it looked like what it was: \nthe enlarged end of a sewer pipe. And since it lacked even a wooden seat, Tereza had \nto perch on the cold enamel rim."

    "raw_text": "\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 81\nShe was sitting there on the toilet, and her sudden desire to void her bowels was in fact \na desire to go to the extr eme of humiliation, to become only and utterly a body, the \nbody her mother used to say was good for not hing but digesting and excreting. And as \nshe voided her bowels, Tereza was overco me by a feeling of infinite grief and \nloneliness. Nothing could be more miserabl e than her naked body perched on the \nenlarged end of a sewer pipe. \nHer soul had lost its onlooker's  curiosity, its malice and prid e; it had retreated deep into \nthe body again, to the farthest gut, waiting desperately for someone to call it out. \nShe stood up from the toilet, fl ushed it, and went into the an teroom. The soul trembled \nin her body, her naked, spurned body. She still felt on her anus the touch of the paper \nshe had used to wipe herself. \nAnd suddenly something unforgettable occurr ed: suddenly she felt a desire to go in to \nhim and hear his voice, his words. If he spok e to her in a soft, deep voice, her soul \nwould take courage and rise to the surface of her body, and she would burst out crying. \nShe would put her arms around him the way she had put her arms around the chestnut \ntree's thick trunk in her dream. \nStanding there in the anteroom, she tried to  withstand the strong desire to burst out \ncrying in his presence. She knew that her failure to withstand it  would have ruinous \nconsequences. She would fall in love with him. \nJust then, his voice called to her from the inner room. Now that she heard that voice by \nitself (divorced from the eng ineer's tall stature), it amazed her: it was high-pitched and \nthin. How could she have ignored it all this time? \nPerhaps the surprise of that unpleasant voice was what saved her from temptation. She \nwent inside, picked up her clothes from the floor, threw them on, and left. \nShe had done her shopping and was on her way home. Karenin had the usual roll in his \nmouth. It was a cold morning;  there was a slight frost. They were passing a housing \ndevelopment, where in the spaces between  buildings the tenants maintained small \nflower and vegetable gardens, when Karenin suddenly stood stock still and riveted his \neyes on something. She looked over, but could see nothing out of the ordinary. Karenin \ngave a tug, and she followed along behind. Only then did she notice the black head and \nlarge beak of a crow lying on the cold di rt of a barren plot. The bodiless head bobbed \nslowly up and down, and the beak gave out an occasional hoarse and mournful croak. \nKarenin was so excited he dropped his roll. Tereza tied him to a tree to prevent him \nfrom hurting the crow. Then sh e knelt down and tried to di g up the soil that had been \nstamped down around the bird to bury it aliv e. It was not easy. She broke a nail. The \nblood began to flow. \nAll at once a rock landed nearby . She turned and caught sight of two nine- or ten-year-\nold boys peeking out from behind a wall. She stood up. They saw her move, saw the \ndog by the tree, and ran off.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 82\nOnce more she knelt down and scratched away  at the dirt. At last she succeeded in \npulling the crow out of its grave. But the crow was lame an d could neither walk nor fly. \nShe wrapped it up in the red scarf she had been wearing around her neck, and pressed \nit to her body with her left hand. With her ri ght hand she untied Karenin from the tree. It \ntook all the strength she could muster to quiet him down and make him heel. \nShe rang the doorbell, not having a free hand for the key. Tomas opened the door. She \nhanded him the leash, and with the words Hold hi m! took the crow into the bathroom. \nShe laid it on the floor under the washbasin. It flapped its wings a little, but could move \nno more than that. There was a thick yellow liquid oozing from it. She made a bed of old \nrags to protect it from the cold tiles. From  time to time the bird  would give a hopeless \nflap of its lame wing and raise its beak as a reproach. \nShe sat transfixed on the edge of the bath, unable to take her  eyes off the dying crow. \nIn its solitude and desolati on she saw a reflection of her own fate, and she repeated \nseveral times to herself, I have no one left in the world but Tomas. \nDid her adventure with the engi neer teach her that casual sex has nothing to do with \nlove? That it is light, weightless? Was she calmer now? \nNot in the least. \nShe kept picturing the following scene: She had come out of the toilet and her body was \nstanding in the anteroom naked and spurned. Her soul was trembling, terrified, buried \nin the depths of her bowels. If at that moment the man in the inner room had addressed \nher soul, she would have burst out crying and fallen into his arms. \nShe imagined what it would have been like if the wo man standing in the anteroom had \nbeen one of Tomas's mistresses and if the man inside had been To mas. All he would \nhave had to do was say one word, a single word, and the girl would have thrown her \narms around him and wept. \nTereza knew what happens during the moment love is born: the woman cannot resist \nthe voice calling forth her terrified soul; t he man cannot resist the woman whose soul \nthus responds to his voice. Tomas had no defense against the lure of love, and Tereza \nfeared for him every minute of every hour. \nWhat weapons did she have at her disposal? None but her fidelity. And she offered him \nthat at the very outset, the very first day, as if aware she had nothing more to give. \nTheir love was an oddly asymmetrical constr uction: it was supported by the absolute \ncertainty of her fidelity like a gigantic edifice supported by a single column. \nBefore long, the crow stopped flapping its wi ngs, and gave no more than the twitch of a \nbroken, mangled leg. Tereza refused to be separated from it. She could have been \nkeeping vigil over a dying sister. In the end, however, she did step into the kitchen for a \nbite to eat. \nWhen she returned, the crow was dead.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 83\nIn the first year of her love, Tereza would cry out during intercourse. Screaming, as I \nhave pointed out, was meant to  blind and deafen the senses . With time she screamed \nless, but her soul was still blinded by love, and saw nothing. Making love with the \nengineer in the absence of love was what finally restored her soul's sight. \nDuring her next visit to the sauna, she stood before the mirror agai n and, looking at \nherself, reviewed the scene of physical love that had taken place in the engineer's flat. \nIt was not her lover she remembered. In fact, she would have been hard put to describe \nhim. She may not even have noticed what he looked like  naked. What she did \nremember (and what she now observed, aroused, in the mirror) was her own body: her \npubic triangle and the circular blotch locate d just above it. The blotch, which until then \nshe had regarded as the most prosaic of skin blemishes, had become an obsession. \nShe longed to see it again and again in that implausible proximity to an alien penis. \nHere I must stress again: She had no desir e to see another man's organs. She wished \nto see her own private parts in close proxim ity to an alien penis. She did not desire her \nlover's body. She desired her own body, newly  discovered, intimate and alien beyond \nall others, incomparably exciting. \nLooking at her body speckled with droplets of shower water, she imagined the engineer \ndropping in at the bar. Oh, how she longed for him to come, longed for him to invite her \nback! Oh, how she yearned for it! \nEvery day she feared that the engineer would make his appearance and she would be \nunable to say no. But the days passed, and t he fear that he would come merged \ngradually into the dread that he would not. \nA month had gone by, and still the engineer stayed away. Tere za found it inexplicable. \nHer frustrated desire receded and turned into a troublesome question: Why did he fail \nto come? \nWaiting on customers one day, she came upon the bald-headed man who had attacked \nher for serving alcohol to a minor. He was te lling a dirty joke in a loud voice. It was a \njoke she had heard a hundred times before from  the drunks in the small town where \nshe had once served beer. Once more, she had the feeling that her mother's world was \nintruding on her. She curtly interrupted the bald man. \nI don't take orders from you, the man re sponded in a huff. You ought to thank your \nlucky stars we let you stay here in the bar.  \nWe? Who do you mean by we?  \nUs, said the man, holding up his glass for anot her vodka. I won't have any more insults \nout of you, is that clear? Oh, and by the way, he added, pointing to Tereza's neck, \nwhich was wound round with a strand of cheap pearls, where did you get those from? \nYou can't tell me your husband gave them to you. A window washer! He can't afford \ngifts like that. It's your customers, isn't it? I wonder what you give them in exchange?  \nYou shut your mouth this instant! she hissed.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 84\nJust remember that prostitution is a criminal  offense, he went on, trying to grab hold of \nthe necklace. \nSuddenly Karenin jumped up, leaned his front paws on the bar, and began to snarl. \nThe ambassador said: He's with the secret police.  \nThen why is he so open about it? What good is a secret po lice that can't keep its \nsecrets?  \nThe ambassador positioned himself on the cot by folding his legs under his body, as he \nhad learned to do in yoga class. Kennedy, beaming down on him from the frame on the \nwall, gave his words a special consecration. \nThe secret police have several functions, my dear, he began in an avuncular tone. The \nfirst is the classical one. They keep an ear  out for what people are saying and report it \nto their superiors. \nThe second function is intimidatory. They want  to make it seem as  if they have us in \ntheir power; they want us to be afraid. That is what your bald-headed friend was after. \nThe third function consists of staging situat ions that will compro mise us. Gone are the \ndays when they tried to accuse us of plotti ng the downfall of the st ate. That would only \nincrease our popularity. Now they slip hashi sh in our pockets or claim we've raped a \ntwelve-year-old girl. They can always dig up some girl to back them.  \nThe engineer immediately popped back into Tereza's mind. Why had he never come? \nThey need to trap people, the ambassador went  on, to force them to collaborate and \nset other traps for other people, so that gradually they can turn the whole nation into a \nsingle organization of informers.  \nTereza could think of nothing but the possi bility that the engineer had been sent by the \npolice. And who was that strange boy who drank himself silly and told her he loved her? \nIt was because of him that the bald police spy had launched into her and the engineer \nstood up for her. So all three had been playi ng parts in a prearranged scenario meant \nto soften her up for the seduction! \nHow could she have missed it? T he flat was so odd, and he di dn't belong there at all! \nWhy would an elegantly dressed engineer live in a miserable place like that? Was he \nan engineer? And if so, how could he leave work at two in the afternoon? Besides, how \nmany engineers read Sophocles? No, that was no engineer's library! The whole place \nhad more the flavor of a flat confiscated fr om a poor imprisoned intellectual. Her father \nwas put in prison when she wa s ten, and the state had confisca ted their flat and all her \nfather's books. Who knows to what use the flat had then been put? \nNow she saw clearly why the engineer h ad never returned: he had accomplished his \nmission. What mission? The drunken undercove r agent had inadvertently given it away \nwhen he said, Just remember that prostitution is a criminal offense. Now that self-styled\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 85\nengineer would testify that she had slept with him and demanded to be paid! They \nwould threaten to blow it up into a sc andal unless she agreed to  report on the people \nwho got drunk in her bar. \nDon't worry, the ambassador comforted her. Your story doesn't sound the least bit \ndangerous.  \nI suppose it doesn't, she said in a tight voic e, as she walked out into the Prague night \nwith Karenin. \nPeople usually escape from their troubles into  the future; they draw an imaginary line \nacross the path of time, a line beyond which t heir current troubles will cease to exist. \nBut Tereza saw no such lin e in her future. Only l ooking back could bring her \nconsolation. It was Sunday again. They got into the car and drove far beyond the limits \nof Prague. \nTomas was at the wheel, Tereza next to him, and Karenin in the back, occasionally \nleaning over to lick their ears. After two hours, they came to a small town known for its \nspa where they had been for several days six years earlier. They wanted to spend the \nnight there. \nThey pulled into the square and  got out of the car. Nothing had changed. They stood \nfacing the hotel they had stayed at. The same old linden trees rose up before it. Off to \nthe left ran an old wooden col onnade culminating in a stre am spouting its medicinal \nwater into a marble bowl. People were bending over it, the same small glasses in hand. \nWhen Tomas looked back at the hotel, he no ticed that something had in fact changed. \nWhat had once been the Grand now bore the name Baikal. He looked at the street sign \non the corner of the building: Moscow Square . Then they took a walk (Karenin tagged \nalong on his own, without a leash) through all the streets they  had known, and \nexamined all their names: Stalingrad Street, Leningrad Street, Rost ov Street, \nNovosibirsk Street, Kiev St reet, Odessa Street. There was a Tchaikovsky Sanatorium, \na Tolstoy Sanatorium, a Rimsky-Korsakov Sanatorium; there was a Hotel Suvorov, a \nGorky Cinema, and a Cafe Pushkin. All the names were taken from Russian \ngeography, from Russian history. \nTereza suddenly recalled the first days of th e invasion. People in every city and town \nhad pulled down the str eet signs; sign posts had disappeared. Overnight, the country \nhad become nameless. For seven days, Russian troops wandered t he countryside, not \nknowing where they were. The officers sear ched for newspaper offices, for television \nand radio stations to occupy, but could not find them. Whenever they asked, they would \nget either a shrug of the shoulders or false names and directions. \nHindsight now made that anonymity seem qui te dangerous to the country. The streets \nand buildings could no longer return to thei r original names. As a result, a Czech spa \nhad suddenly metamorphosed into a miniatur e imaginary Russia, and the past that \nTereza had gone there to find had turned ou t to be confiscated. It would be impossible \nfor them to spend the night.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 86\nThey started back to the car in silence. She was thinking about how all things and \npeople seemed to go about in dis guise. An old Czech town was covered with Russian \nnames. Czechs taking pictures of the inva sion had unconsciously worked for the secret \npolice. The man who sent her to die had worn a mask of Tomas's face over his own. \nThe spy played the part of an engineer, and t he engineer tried to play the part of the \nman from Petrin. The emblem of the book in  his flat proved a sh am designed to lead \nher astray. \nRecalling the book she had hel d in her hand there, she had a sudden flash of insight \nthat made her cheeks burn r ed. What had been the sequence of events? The engineer \nannounced he would bring in some coffee. She walked over to the bookshelves and \ntook down Sophocles' Oedipus. Then the engineer came back. But without the coffee! \nAgain and again she returned to  that situation: How long was he away when he went \nfor the coffee? Surely a minute at the least. Ma ybe two or even three. And what had he \nbeen up to for so long in that miniature anteroom? Or had he gone to the toilet? She \ntried to remember hearing the door shut or the water flush. No, s he was positive she'd \nheard no water; she would have remembered that. And she was almost certain the door \nhadn't closed. What had he been up to in that anteroom? \nIt was only too clear. If they meant to  trap her, they would need more than the \nengineer's testimony. They woul d need incontrovertible evidence. In the course of his \nsuspiciously long absence, the engineer could only have been setting up a movie \ncamera in the anteroom. Or, more likely, he had let in someone with a still camera, who \nthen had photographed them from behind the curtain. \nOnly a few weeks earlier, she had scoffed at Prochazka for failing to see that he lived in \na concentration camp, where privacy ceased to exist. But what a bout her? By getting \nout from under her mother's roof, she t hought in all innocence that she had once and \nfor all become master of her privacy. But no,  her mother's roof stretched out over the \nwhole world and would never let her be. Tereza would never escape her. \nAs they walked down the gar den-lined steps leading back to  the square, Tomas asked \nher, What's wrong?  \nBefore she could respond, someone called out a greeting to Tomas. \nHe was a man of about fifty with a weather-beaten face, a farm worker whom Tomas \nhad once operated on and who was sent to t he spa once a year for treatment. He \ninvited Tomas and Tereza to have a glass of  wine with him. Since the law prohibited \ndogs from entering public places, Tereza t ook Karenin back to the car while the men \nfound a table at a nearby cafe. When she ca me up to them, the man was saying, We \nlive a quiet life. Two years ago they even elected me chairman of the collective. \nCongratulations, said Tomas. \nYou know how it is. People are dying to move to the city . The big shots, they're happy \nwhen somebody wants to stay put. They can't fire us from our jobs.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 87\nIt would be ideal for us, said Tereza. You'd be bored to tears, ma'am. There's nothing to \ndo there. Nothing at all.  \nTereza looked into the farm worker's w eather-beaten face. She found him very kind. \nFor the first time in ages, she had found som eone kind! An image of life in the country \narose before her eyes: a village with a belfry, fields, woods, a rabbit scampering along a \nfurrow, a hunter with a green cap. She had never lived in the country. Her image of it \ncame entirely from what s he had heard. Or read. Or received unconsciously from \ndistant ancestors. And yet it lived within her, as plain and clear as the daguerreotype of \nher great-grandmother in the family album. \nDoes it give you any trouble? Tomas asked. The farmer pointed to the area at the back \nof the neck where the brain is connected to the spinal cord. I still have pains here from \ntime to time.  \nWithout getting out of his seat, Tomas pal pated the spot and put his former patient \nthrough a brief examination. I no  longer have the right to pr escribe drugs, he said after \nhe had finished, but tell the doctor taking care of you now that you talked to me and I \nrecommended you use this. And tearing a sheet of paper from the pad in his wallet, he \nwrote out the name of a medicine in large letters. \nThey started back to Prague. \nAll the way Tereza brooded about the phot ograph showing her naked body embracing \nthe engineer. She tried to console herself with the thought that ev en if the picture did \nexist, Tomas would never see it. The only va lue it had for them was as a blackmailing \ndevice. It would lose that value the moment they sent it to Tomas. \nBut what if the police decid ed somewhere along the way t hat they couldn't use her? \nThen the picture would become a mere play thing in their hands, and nothing would \nprevent them from slipping it in an envelope and sending it off to Tomas. Just for the \nfun of it. \nWhat would happen if To mas were to receive such a picture? Would he throw her out? \nPerhaps not. Probably not. But the fragile edifi ce of their love would certainly come \ntumbling down. For that edifice rested on the single column of her fidelity, and loves are \nlike empires: when the idea they are founded on crumbles, they, too, fade away. \nAnd now she had an image before her eyes : a rabbit scampering along a furrow, a \nhunter with a green cap, and the belfry of a village church rising up over the woods. \nShe wanted to tell Tomas t hat they should l eave Prague. Leave the children who bury \ncrows alive in the ground, leave the police spies, leav e the young women armed with \numbrellas. She wanted to tell him that they should move to the country. That it was their \nonly path to salvation. \nShe turned to him. But Tomas did not resp ond. He kept his eyes on the road ahead. \nHaving thus failed to scale the fence of silence between them, s he lost all courage to \nspeak. She felt as she had felt when walki ng down Petrin Hill. Her stomach was in \nknots, and she thought she was going to be sick.  She was afraid of Tomas. He was too\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 88\nstrong for her; she was too weak. He gave her commands that she could not \nunderstand; she tried to carry them out, but did not know how. \nShe wanted to go back to Petrin Hill and ask t he man with the rifle to  wind the blindfold \naround her eyes and let her lean against the trunk  of the chestnut tree. She wanted to \ndie. \nWaking up, she realized she was at home alone. \nShe went outside and set off in the direction of the embankment. She wanted to see the \nVltava. She wanted to stand on its banks and look long and hard into its waters, \nbecause the sight of the flow was soothing and healing. The river flowed from century \nto century, and human affairs pl ay themselves out on its banks. Play themselves out to \nbe forgotten the next day, while the river flows on. \nLeaning against the balustrade, she peered into the water. She was on the outskirts of \nPrague, and the Vltava had already flowed through the city, leaving behind the glory of \nthe Castle and churches; like an actress after a performance, it was tired and \ncontemplative; it flowed on between its dirty banks, bounded by  walls and fences that \nthemselves bounded factories and abandoned playgrounds. \nShe was staring at the water—it seemed sadder and darker here—when suddenly she \nspied a strange object in the mi ddle of the river, something red—yes, it was a bench. A \nwooden bench on iron legs, the kind Prague's parks abound in. It was floating down the \nVltava. Followed by another. And another and another, and only then did Tereza realize \nthat all the park benches of Prague were fl oating downstream, away from the city, \nmany, many benches, more and more, drifting by like the autumn leaves that the water \ncarries off from the woods—red, yellow, blue. \nShe turned and looked behind her as if to a sk the passersby what it meant. Why are \nPrague's park benches floating downstream? But everyone passed her by, indifferent, \nfor little did they care that a river flowed from century to century through their ephemeral \ncity. \nAgain she looked down at the river. She was grief-st ricken. She understood that what \nshe saw was a farewell. \nWhen most of the benches had vanished fr om sight, a few latecomers appeared: one \nmore yellow one, and then another, blue, the last. \nPART FIVE \nLightness and Weight \nWhen Tereza unexpectedly came to visit Tomas in Prague, he made love to her, as I \npointed out in Part One, that very day, or rather, that very hour, but suddenly thereafter \nshe became feverish. As she lay in his bed and he stood over her, he had the \nirrepressible feeling that she was a child who had been put in a bulrush basket and sent \ndownstream to him."

    "raw_text": "\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 89\nThe image of the abandoned child had consequently become dear to him, and he often \nreflected on the ancient myths in which it o ccurred. It was apparently  with this in mind \nthat he picked up a translation of Sophocles' Oedipus. \nThe story of Oedipus is well known: Abandoned as an in fant, he was taken to King \nPolybus, who raised him. O ne day, when he had grown into a youth, he came upon a \ndignitary riding along a mountain path. A quarrel arose, and Oedipus killed the \ndignitary. Later he became the husband of Queen Jocasta and ruler of Thebes. Little \ndid he know that the man he had killed in  the mountains was his father and the woman \nwith whom he slept his mother. In the meantime, fate visi ted a plague on his subjects \nand tortured them with great pe stilences. When Oedipus real ized that he himself was \nthe cause of their suffering,  he put out his own eyes and wandered blind away from \nThebes. \nAnyone who thinks that the Communist regimes of Central Europe are exclusively the \nwork of criminals is overlook ing a basic truth: t he criminal regimes were made not by \ncriminals but by enthusiasts convinced they  had discovered the only road to paradise. \nThey defended that road so va liantly that they were fo rced to execute many people. \nLater it became clear that there was no paradise, that t he enthusiasts were therefore \nmurderers. \nThen everyone took to shouting at the Communists: You're the ones responsible for our \ncountry's misfortunes (it had grown poor a nd desolate), for its loss of independence (it \nhad fallen into the hands of the Russians), for its judicial murders! \nAnd the accused responded: We didn't know! We were deceived! We were true \nbelievers! Deep in our hearts we are innocent! \nIn the end, the dispute narrowed down to a si ngle question: Did they really not know or \nwere they merely making believe? \nTomas followed the dispute closely (as did his ten million fellow Czechs) and was of the \nopinion that while there had definitely been Communists who were not completely \nunaware of the atrocities (they could not have been ignorant of t he horrors that had \nbeen perpetrated and were still being perpetrated in postrevolutionary Russia), it was \nprobable that the majority of the Communists had not in fact known of them. \nBut, he said to himself, whether they knew or didn't know is not the main issue; the \nmain issue is whether a man is innocent because he didn't know. Is a fool on the throne \nrelieved of all responsibility merely because he is a fool? \nLet us concede that a Czech p ublic prosecutor in the early  fifties who called for the \ndeath of an innocent man was deceived by  the Russian secret police and the \ngovernment of his own country. But now that we  all know the accusations to have been \nabsurd and the executed to have been i nnocent, how can that selfsame public \nprosecutor defend his purity of  heart by beating himself on t he chest and proclaiming, \nMy conscience is clear! I didn't know! I was a believer! Isn't his I didn't know! I was a \nbeliever! at the very root of his irreparable guilt?\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 90\nIt was in this connection that Tomas recalled the tale of Oedipus: Oedipus did not know \nhe was sleeping with his own mother, yet when he realized what had happened, he did \nnot feel innocent. Unable to stand the sight of the misfortunes  he had wrought by not \nknowing, he put out his eyes and wandered blind away from Thebes. \nWhen Tomas heard Communists s houting in defense of their inner purity, he said to \nhimself, As a result of your not knowing, this country has lost its freedom, lost it for \ncenturies, perhaps, and you shout that you feel no guilt? How can you stand the sight of \nwhat you've done? How is it you aren't horrified? Have you no eyes to see? If you had \neyes, you would have to put them out and wander away from Thebes! \nThe analogy so pleased him that he often used it in conversation with friends, and his \nformulation grew increasingly precise and elegant. \nLike all intellectuals at the time, he read a weekly newspaper published in three \nhundred thousand copies by the Union of Cz ech Writers. It was a paper that had \nachieved considerable autonomy within the regime and dealt with issues forbidden to \nothers. Consequently, it was the writers' pa per that raised the is sue of who bore the \nburden of guilt for the judicial murders resulti ng from the political tr ials that marked the \nearly years of Communist power. \nEven the writers' paper merely repeated the same  question: Did they know or did they \nnot? Because Tomas found this question se cond-rate, he sat down one day, wrote \ndown his reflections on Oedipu s, and sent them to the weekly. A month later he \nreceived an answer: an invitation to the edit orial offices. The ed itor who greeted him \nwas short but as straight as a ruler. He suggested that Tomas change the word order in \none of the sentences. And soon the text made its appearance— on the next to the last \npage, in the Letters to the Editor section. \nTomas was far from overjoyed. They had considered it necessary to ask him to the \neditorial offices to approve a change in word order, but then, without asking him, \nshortened his text by so much  that it was reduced to its basic thesis (making it too \nschematic and aggressive). He didn't like it anymore. \nAll this happened in the spri ng of 1968. Alexander Dubcek  was in power, along with \nthose Communists who felt guilty and were willing to do something about their guilt. But \nthe other Communists, the ones who kept shouting how innocent they were, were afraid \nthat the enraged nation would bring them to justice. They complained daily to the \nRussian ambassador, trying to drum up support. When Tomas's letter appeared, they \nshouted: See what things have come to! Now t hey're telling us publicly to put our eyes \nout! \nTwo or three months later the Russians dec ided that free speech was inadmissible in \ntheir gubernia, and in a single night they occupied Tomas's country with their army. \nWhen Tomas came back to Prague from Zurich , he took up in hi s hospital where he \nhad left off. Then one day the chief surgeon called him in. \nYou know as well as I do, he said, that you're no writer or journalist or savior of the \nnation. You're a doctor and a scientist. I'd be very sad to lose you, and I'll do everything\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 91\nI can to keep you here. But you've got to retract that article you wrote about Oedipus. Is \nit terribly important to you?  \nTo tell you the truth, said Tomas, recalli ng how they had amputat ed a good third of the \ntext, it couldn't be any less important.  \nYou know what's at stake, said the chief surgeon. \nHe knew, all right. There were two things in  the balance: his honor (which consisted in \nhis refusing to retract what he had said) and what he had come to call the meaning of \nhis life (his work in medicine and research). \nThe chief surgeon went on: The pressure to make public retractions of past \nstatements—there's something medieval about it. What does it mean, anyway, to \n'retract' what you've said? How can anyone state categoric ally that a thought he once \nhad is no longer valid? In modern times an idea can be refuted, yes, but not retracted. \nAnd since to retract an idea is impossible, merely verbal, formal sorcery, I see no \nreason why you shouldn't do as they wish. In a society run by terror, no statements \nwhatsoever can be taken seriously. They ar e all forced, and it is the duty of every \nhonest man to ignore them. Let me conclude by sa ying that it is in my interest and in \nyour patients' interest that you stay on here with us.  \nYou're right, I'm sure, said Tomas, looking very unhappy. \nBut? The chief surgeon was trying to guess his train of thought. \nI'm afraid I'd be ashamed.  \nAshamed! You mean to say you hold your co lleagues in such high esteem that you \ncare what they think?  \nNo, I don't hold them in high esteem, said Tomas. \nOh, by the way, the chief surgeon added, you won't have to make a public statement. I \nhave their assurance. They're bureaucrats. All they need is a note in their files to the \neffect that you've nothing against the regime. Then if someone comes and attacks them \nfor letting you work at the hospital, they're covered. They've given me their word that \nanything you say will remain between yo u and them. They have no intention of \npublishing a word of it.  \nGive me a week to think it over, said Tomas, and there the matter rested. \nTomas was considered the best surgeon in the hospital. Rumor had it that the chief \nsurgeon, who was getting on towards retirement  age, would soon ask him to take over. \nWhen that rumor was supplemen ted by the rumor that t he authorities had requested a \nstatement of self-criticism from him, no one doubted he would comply. \nThat was the first thing that struck him: although he had never give n people cause to \ndoubt his integrity, they were ready to bet on his dishonesty rather than on his virtue.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 92\nThe second thing that struck him was their r eaction to the position they attributed to \nhim. I might divide it into two basic types: \nThe first type of reaction came from people w ho themselves (they or their intimates) \nhad retracted something, who had themselv es been forced to make public peace with \nthe occupation regime or were prepared to  do so (unwillingly, of course—no one \nwanted to do it). \nThese people began to smile a curious smile at him, a smile he had never seen before: \nthe sheepish smile of secret conspiratori al consent. It was the smile of two men \nmeeting accidentally in a brothel : both slightly abashed, they are at the same time glad \nthat the feeling is mutual , and a bond of something ak in to brotherhood develops \nbetween them. \nTheir smiles were all the more complacent  because he had never had the reputation of \nbeing a conformist. His supposed acceptance  of the chief surgeon's proposal was \ntherefore further proof that  cowardice was slowly but surely becoming the norm of \nbehavior and would soon cease being taken for what it actually was. He had never \nbeen friends with these people, a nd he realized with dismay that  if he did in fact make \nthe statement the chief surgeon had requested of him, they would start inviting him to \nparties and he would have to make friends with them. \nThe second type of reaction came from people who themselves (they or their intimates) \nhad been persecuted, who had refused to comp romise with the occupation powers or \nwere convinced they would refuse to co mpromise (to sign a statement) even though no \none had requested it of them (for instance, because they were too young to be \nseriously involved). \nOne of the latter, Doctor S., a talented young physician, asked Tomas one day, Well, \nhave you written it up for them?  \nWhat in the world are you talking about? Tomas asked in return. \nWhy, your retraction, he said . There was no malice in his voice. He even smiled. One \nmore smile from that thick herbal of smiles: the smile of smug moral superiority. \nTell me, what do you know about my retraction? said Tomas. Have you read it?  \nNo, said S. \nThen what are you babbling about?  \nStill smug, still smiling, S. replied, Look, we know how it goes. You incorporate it into a \nletter to the chief surgeon or to some minister or somebody , and he promises it won't \nleak out and humiliate the author. Isn't that right?  \nTomas shrugged his shoulders and let S. go on.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 93\nBut even after the statement is safely filed away, the author knows that it can be made \npublic at any moment. So from then on he does n't open his mouth, never criticizes a \nthing, never makes the slightest protest. The first peep out of him and into print it goes, \nsullying his good name far and wide. On the whole, it's rather a nice method. One could \nimagine worse.  \nYes, it's a very nice method, said Tomas,  but would you mind telling me who gave you \nthe idea I'd agreed to go along with it?  \nS. shrugged his shoulders, but the smile did not disappear from his face. \nAnd suddenly Tomas grasped a strange fact: everyone was smiling at him, everyone \nwanted him to write the re traction; it would make everyone happy! The people with the \nfirst type of reaction would be happy because  by inflating cowardice, he would make \ntheir actions seem commonplace and thereby  give them back their lost honor. The \npeople with the second type of  reaction, who had come to consider their honor a \nspecial privilege never to be yielded, nurtur ed a secret love for the cowards, for without \nthem their courage would s oon erode into a trivial, m onotonous grind admired by no \none. \nTomas could not bear the smiles. He though t he saw them everywhere, even on the \nfaces of strangers in the str eet. He began losing sleep. Coul d it be? Did he really hold \nthose people in such high esteem? No. He  had nothing good to say about them and \nwas angry with himself for letting their glances upset him so. It was completely illogical. \nHow could someone who had so little respect for people be so dependent on what they \nthought of him? \nPerhaps his deep-seated mistrust of people (his  doubts as to their right to decide his \ndestiny and to judge him) had play ed its part in his choice of  profession, a profession \nthat excluded him from public display. A man who chooses to be a politician, say, \nvoluntarily makes the public his judge, with the naive assu rance that he  will gain its \nfavor. And if the crowd does express its disapproval, it me rely goads him on to bigger \nand better things, much in the way Tomas was spurred on by the difficulty of a \ndiagnosis. \nA doctor (unlike a politician or an actor) is judged only by his patients and immediate \ncolleagues, that is, behind closed doors, man to man. Confront ed by the looks of those \nwho judge him, he can respond at once with his own look, to explain or defend himself. \nNow (for the first time in his life) Tomas found himself in a situation where the looks \nfixed on him were so numerous that he was unable to register t hem. He could answer \nthem neither with his own look nor with words. He was at everyone's mercy. People \ntalked about him inside and outside the hospit al (it was a time when news about who \nbetrayed, who denounced, and who collab orated spread through nervous Prague with \nthe uncanny speed of a bush telegraph); although he knew about it, he could do \nnothing to stop it. He was surprised at how unbearable he found it, how panic-stricken it \nmade him feel. The interest t hey showed in him was as unpleasant as an elbowing \ncrowd or the pawings of the people who tear our clothes off in nightmares.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 94\nHe went to the chief surgeon and told him he would not write a word. \nThe chief surgeon shook his hand with grea ter energy than usual and said that he had \nanticipated Tomas's decision. \nPerhaps you can find a way to keep me on even without a statement, said Tomas, \ntrying to hint that a threat by all his colleagues to resign upon his dismissal would \nsuffice. \nBut his colleagues never dreamed of threat ening to resign, and so before long (the \nchief surgeon shook his hand even more ener getically than the previous time—it was \nblack and blue for days), he was forced to leave the hospital. \nFirst he went to work in a country clinic  about fifty miles from Prague. He commuted \ndaily by train and came home exhausted. A year later,  he managed to find a more \nadvantageous but much inferior position at a clinic on the outskirts of Prague. There, he \ncould no longer practice surgery, and becam e a general practitioner. The waiting room \nwas jammed, and he had scarcely five minutes for each patient; he told them how much \naspirin to take, signed their sick-leave docum ents, and referred them to specialists. He \nconsidered himself more civil servant than doctor. \nOne day, at the end of office hours, he wa s visited by a man of about fifty whose \nportliness added to his dignity. He introduced himself as representing the Ministry of the \nInterior, and invited Tomas to join him for a drink across the street. \nHe ordered a bottle of wine. I have to drive home, said Tomas by way of refusal. I'll lose \nmy license if they find I've been drinking. The man from the Ministry of the Interior \nsmiled. If anything happens, just show them this. And he handed Tomas a card \nengraved with his name (though clearly not his real name) and the telephone number of \nthe Ministry. \nHe then went into a long speech about ho w much he admired Tomas and how the \nwhole Ministry was distressed at the thought  of so respected a surgeon dispensing \naspirin at an outlying clinic . He gave Tomas to understand that although he couldn't \ncome out and say it, the police did not agree with drastic tactics like removing \nspecialists from their posts. \nSince no one had thought to praise Tomas in quite some time, he listened to the plump \nofficial very carefully, and he was surprised by the precision and detail of the man's \nknowledge of his professional career. How defenseless we are in the face of flattery! \nTomas was unable to prevent himself from taki ng seriously what the Ministry official \nsaid. \nBut it was not out of mere vanity. More important was Tomas's lack of experience. \nWhen you sit face to face with someone who is pleasant, respectful, and polite, you \nhave a hard time reminding yourself that nothing he says is true, that nothing is sincere. \nMaintaining nonbelief (constantly, systematically, without the slightest vacillation)\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 95\nrequires a tremendous effort and the proper training—in other words, frequent police \ninterrogations. Tomas lacked that training. \nThe man from the Ministry went on: We know you had an excellent  position in Zurich, \nand we very much appreciate your having returned. It was a noble  deed. You realized \nyour place was here. And then  he added, as if scolding To mas for something, But your \nplace is at the operating table, too!  \nI couldn't agree more, said Tomas. \nThere was a short pause, after which the man fr om the Ministry said in mournful tones, \nThen tell me, Doctor, do you really think t hat Communists should put out their eyes? \nYou, who have given so many people the gift of health?  \nBut that's preposterous! Tomas cried in self-defense. Why don't you read what I wrote?  \nI have read it, said the man from the Ministry  in a voice that was meant to sound very \nsad. \nWell, did I write that Communists ought to put out their eyes?  \nThat's how everyone under stood it, said the man from t he Ministry, his voice growing \nsadder and sadder. \nIf you'd read the complete version, the way I wrote it originally, yo u wouldn't have read \nthat into it. The published version was slightly cut.  \nWhat was that? asked the man from the Ministry, pricking up his ears. You mean they \ndidn't publish it the way you wrote it?  \nThey cut it.  \nA lot?  \nBy about a third.  \nThe man from the Ministry appeared sincerel y shocked. That was very improper of \nthem.  \nTomas shrugged his shoulders. \nYou should have protested! Demanded they set the record straight immediately!  \nThe Russians came before I had time to think about it. We all had other things to think \nabout then.  \nBut you don't want people to think that you,  a doctor, wanted to deprive human beings \nof their right to see!\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 96\nTry to understand, will you? It was a letter to the editor, buried in the back pages. No \none even noticed it. No one but the Russian em bassy staff, because it's what they look \nfor.  \nDon't say that! Don't think that! I myself ha ve talked to many people who read your \narticle and were amazed you could have writt en it. But now that you tell me it didn't \ncome out the way you wrote it, a lot of things fall into place. Did they put you up to it?  \nTo writing it? No. I submitted it on my own.  \nDo you know the people there?  \nWhat people?  \nThe people who published your article.  \nNo.  \nYou mean you never spoke to them?  \nThey asked me to come in once in person.  \nWhy?  \nAbout the article.  \nAnd who was it you talked to?  \nOne of the editors.  \nWhat was his name?  \nNot until that point did Tomas realize that he was under in terrogation. All at once he \nsaw that his every word could put someone in danger. Although he obviously knew the \nname of the editor in question, he denied it: I'm not sure.  \nNow, now, said the man in a voice dripping with indignation over Tomas's insincerity, \nyou can't tell me he didn't introduce himself!  \nIt is a tragicomic fact that our proper upbringing has become an ally of the secret police. \nWe do not know how to lie. The Tell the tr uth! imperative drummed into us by our \nmamas and papas functions so aut omatically that we feel ashamed of lying even to a \nsecret policeman during an interr ogation. It is simpler for us to argue with him or insult \nhim (which makes no sense whatever) than to lie to his face (which is the only thing to \ndo). \nWhen the man from the Ministry accused him of  insincerity, Tomas nearly felt guilty; he \nhad to surmount a moral barrier to be able to  persevere in his lie: I suppose he did \nintroduce himself, he said, but because his name didn't ring a bell, I immediately forgot \nit."

    "raw_text": "\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 97\nWhat did he look like?  \nThe editor who had dealt wit h him was a short man with a light brown crew cut. Tomas \ntried to choose diametrically opposed characteristics: He was tall, he said, and had long \nblack hair.  \nAha, said the man from the Ministry, and a big chin!  \nThat's right, said Tomas. \nA little stooped.  \nThat's right, said Tomas again, realizing that now the man from the Ministry had \npinpointed an individu al. Not only had Tomas informed on some poor editor but, more \nimportant, the information he had given was false. \nAnd what did he want to see you about? What did you talk about?  \nIt had something to do with word order.  \nIt sounded like a ridiculous attempt at evasion. And again the man from the Ministry \nwaxed indignant at Tomas's refusa l to tell the truth: First you tell me they cut your text \nby a third, then you tell me they talked to you about word order! Is that logical?  \nThis time Tomas had no trouble responding, because he had told the absolute truth. It's \nnot logical, but that's how it was. He l aughed. They asked me to let them change the \nword order in one sentence and then cut a third of what I had written.  \nThe man from the Ministry shook his head, as if unable to grasp so immoral an act. \nThat was highly irregular on their part.  \nHe finished his wine and co ncluded: You have been manipulated, Doctor, used. It \nwould be a pity for you and your  patients to suffer as a result. We are very much aware \nof your positive qualities. We'll see what can be done.  \nHe gave Tomas his hand and pumped it cordially. Then each went off to his own car. \nAfter the talk with the man from the Ministry, Tomas fell into a deep depression. How \ncould he have gone along with the jovial tone of the conversation? If he hadn't refused \nto have anything at all to do with the man (he was not prepared for what happened and \ndid not know what was condoned by law and what was not), he could at least have \nrefused to drink wine with him as if t hey were friends! Supposing someone had seen \nhim, someone who knew the man. He could only have inferred that Tomas was working \nwith the police! And why did he even tell him that the arti cle had been cut? Why did he \nthrow in that piece of information? He was extremely displeased with himself. \nTwo weeks later, the man from the Minist ry paid him another visit. Once more he \ninvited him out for a drink, but this time Tomas requested that they stay in his office. \nI understand perfectly, Doctor, said the man, with a smile.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 98\nTomas was intrigued by his words. He said t hem like a chess player who is letting his \nopponent know he made an error in the previous move. \nThey sat opposite each other, Tomas at his desk. After about ten minutes, during which \nthey talked about the flu epidem ic raging at the time, the man said, We've given your \ncase a lot of thought. If we we re the only ones involved, t here would be nothing to it. \nBut we have public opinion to take into account. Whether you meant to or not, you \nfanned the flames of anti-Communist hysteria with your article. I must tell you there was \neven a proposal to take you to court for that article. There's a law against public \nincitement to violence.  \nThe man from the Ministry of the Interior  paused to look Toma s in the eye. Tomas \nshrugged his shoulders. The man assumed hi s comforting tone again. We voted down \nthe proposal. No matter what your responsibility in the affair, society has an interest in \nseeing you use your abilities to the utmos t. The chief surgeon of your hospital speaks \nvery highly of you. We have reports from your patients as well. You are a fine specialist. \nNobody requires a doctor to understand politics.  You let yourself be carried away. It's \nhigh time we settled this thi ng once and for all. That's wh y we've put together a sample \nstatement for you. All you have to do is make it available to the press, and we'll make \nsure it comes out at the proper time. He handed Tomas a piece of paper. \nTomas read what was in it and panicked. It was much worse than what the chief \nsurgeon had asked him to sign two years before.  It did not stop at a retraction of the \nOedipus article. It contained words of love for the Soviet Union, vows of fidelity to the \nCommunist Party; it condemned the intellig entsia, which wanted to push the country \ninto civil war; and, above all, it denounced the editors of the writers' weekly (with special \nemphasis on the tall, stooped editor; Toma s had never met him, though he knew his \nname and had seen pictures of him), who had consciously distorted his article and used \nit for their own devices, turning it into a ca ll for counterrevolution: too cowardly to write \nsuch an article themselves, they had hid behind a naive doctor. \nThe man from the Ministry saw the panic in Tomas's eyes. He leaned over and gave his \nknee a friendly pat under the table. Remember now, Doctor, it's only a sample! Think it \nover, and if there's somethi ng you want to change, I'm sure we can come to an \nagreement. After all, it's your statement!  \nTomas held the paper out to the se cret policeman as if he were afraid to keep it in his \nhands another second, as if he were worried someone would find his fingerprints on it. \nBut instead of taking the pa per, the man from the Ministry  spread his arms in feigned \namazement (the same gesture the Pope uses to bless the crowds from his balcony). \nNow why do a thing like that, Doctor? Keep it. Think it over calmly at home.  \nTomas shook his head and patiently held t he paper in his outstretched hand. In the \nend, the man from the Ministry was forced  to abandon his papal gesture and take the \npaper back.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 99\nTomas was on the point of telling him emphatical ly that he would neit her write nor sign \nany text whatever, but at the last moment he changed his t one and said mildly, I'm no \nilliterate, am I? Why should I sign something I didn't write myself?  \nVery well, then, Doctor. Let's do it your way. You write it up yourself, and we'll go over it \ntogether. You can use what you've just read as a model.  \nWhy didn't Tomas give the secret policeman an immediate and unconditional no? \nThis is what probably went th rough his head: Besides using a statement like that to \ndemoralize the nation in general (which is clearly the Russian strategy), the police could \nhave a concrete goal in his case: they mi ght be gathering evidence for a trial against \nthe editors of the weekly that  had published Tomas's article. If that was so, they would \nneed his statement for the hearing and for the smear campaign the press would \nconduct against them. Were he to refuse fl atly, on principle, there was always the \ndanger that the police would print the prepar ed statement over hi s signature, whether \nhe gave his consent or not. No newspaper would dare publish his denial. No one in the \nworld would believe that he hadn't written or signed it. People derived too much \npleasure from seeing their fe llow man morally humiliated to spoil that pleasure by \nhearing out an explanation. \nBy giving the police the hope that he would write a text of  his own, he gained a bit of \ntime. The very next day he resigned from the clinic, assuming (corre ctly) that after he \nhad descended voluntarily to the lowest rung of the social ladder (a descent being \nmade by thousands of intellectuals in other fi elds at the time), the police would have no \nmore hold over him and he would cease to  interest them. Once he had reached the \nlowest rung on the ladder, they  would no longer be able to publish a statement in his \nname, for the simple reason t hat no one would acc ept it as genuine. Humiliating public \nstatements are associated exclusively with the signatories' rise, not fall. \nBut in Tomas's country, doctors are state employees, and the state may or may not \nrelease them from its service. The official  with whom Tomas negoti ated his resignation \nknew him by name and reputation and tried to talk him into staying on. Tomas suddenly \nrealized that he was not at all sure he had made the proper choice, but he felt bound to \nit by then by an unspoken vow of fidelity, so he stood fast. And that is how he became a \nwindow washer. \nLeaving Zurich for Prague a few years earlie r, Tomas had quietly said to himself, Es \nmuss sein! He was thinking of his love for Te reza. No sooner had he crossed the \nborder, however, than he began to doubt whether it actually di d have to be. Later, lying \nnext to Tereza, he recalled that he had been led to her by a chain of laughable \ncoincidences that took place seven years earlier (when the chief surgeon's sciatica was \nin its early stages) and were about to retu rn him to a cage from which he would be \nunable to escape. \nDoes that mean his life lacked any Es muss sein!, any overriding necessity? In my \nopinion, it did have one. But it was not love, it was his profession. He had come to \nmedicine not by coincidence or calculation but by a deep inner desire.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 100\nInsofar as it is possible to divide people into categories, the surest criterion is the deep-\nseated desires that orient t hem to one or another lifelong activity. Every Frenchman is \ndifferent. But all actors the world over are similar—in Paris, Prague, or the back of \nbeyond. An actor is someone who in early childhood consents to exhibit himself for the \nrest of his life to an anonymous public. Without that basic consent, which has nothing to \ndo with talent, which goes deeper than talent , no one can become an actor. Similarly, a \ndoctor is someone who consents to spend his life involved with human bodies and all \nthat they entail. That basic consent (and not talent or ski ll) enables him to enter the \ndissecting room during the firs t year of medical school and persevere for the requisite \nnumber of years. \nSurgery takes the basic imperat ive of the medical professi on to its outermost border, \nwhere the human makes contact with the divine.  When a person is clubbed violently on \nthe head, he collapses and stops breathing. Some day, he will stop breathing anyway. \nMurder simply hastens a bit what God will eventually see to on His own. God, it may be \nassumed, took murder into account; He di d not take surgery into account. He never \nsuspected that someone woul d dare to stick his hand into the mechanism He had \ninvented, wrapped carefully in skin, and s ealed away from human eyes. When Tomas \nfirst positioned his scalpel on the skin of  a man asleep under an anesthetic, then \nbreached the skin with a decisive incision, and finally cut it open with a precise and \neven stroke (as if it were a piece of fabric —a coat, a skirt, a curtain), he experienced a \nbrief but intense feeling of blasphemy. Then again, that was what attracted him to it! \nThat was the Es muss sein! rooted deep inside him, and it was planted there not by \nchance, not by the chief's sciatica, or by anything external. \nBut how could he take something so much a pa rt of him and cast it off so fast, so \nforcefully, and so lightly? \nHe would respond that he did it so as not to let the police misuse him. But to be quite \nfrank, even if it was theoretica lly possible (and even if a num ber of cases have actually \noccurred), it was not too likel y that the police would make public a false statement over \nhis signature. \nGranted, a man has a right to fear dangers that are less than likely to occur. Granted, \nhe was annoyed with himself and at his cl umsiness, and desired to avoid further \ncontact with the police and the concomitant feeling of helplessness. And granted, he \nhad lost his profession anywa y, because the mechanical aspi rin-medicine he practiced \nat the clinic had nothing in common with his concept of medicine. Even so, the way he \nrushed into his decision seems rather odd to  me. Could it perhaps conceal something \nelse, something deeper that escaped his reasoning? \nEven though he came to love Beethoven th rough Tereza, Tomas was not particularly \nknowledgeable about music, and I doubt t hat he knew the true story behind \nBeethoven's famous Muss es sein? Es muss sein! motif. \nThis is how it goes: A certain Dembscher owed Beethoven fifty florins, and when the \ncomposer, who was chronically short of funds, reminded him of the debt, Dembscher \nheaved a mournful sigh and said, Muss es sein? To which Beethoven replied, with a\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 101\nhearty laugh, Es muss sein! and immediately jotted dow n these words and their \nmelody. On this realistic motif he then co mposed a canon for four voices: three voices \nsing Es muss sein, es muss sein, ja, ja, ja, ja! (It must be, it must be, yes, yes, yes, \nyes!), and the fourth voice chimes in with Heraus mit dem Beutel! (Out with the purse!). \nA year later, the same motif showed up as the basis for the fourth movement of the last \nquartet, Opus 155. By that time, Beethov en had forgotten about Dembscher's purse. \nThe words Es muss sein! had acquired a much more solemn ring; they seemed to issue \ndirectly from the lips of Fate. In Kant 's language, even Good morning, suitably \npronounced, can take the shap e of a metaphysical thesis . German is a language of \nheavy words. Es muss sein! was no longer a joke; it had become der schwer gefasste \nEntschluss (the difficult or weighty resolution). \nSo Beethoven turned a frivolous inspirati on into a serious quartet, a joke into \nmetaphysical truth. It is an interesting tale  of light going to h eavy or, as Parmenides \nwould have it, positive going to negative. Ye t oddly enough, the transformation fails to \nsurprise us. We would have been shocked,  on the other hand, if Beethoven had \ntransformed the seriousness of his quartet into  the trifling joke of a four-voice canon \nabout Dembscher's purse. Had he done so, however, he would have been in the spirit \nof Parmenides and made heavy go to light, that  is, negative to positive! First (as an \nunfinished sketch) would have come the great metaphysical truth and last (as a finished \nmasterpiece)—the most frivolous  of jokes! But we no longer know how to think as \nParmenides thought. \nIt is my feeling that Tomas had long been secretly  irritated by the stern, aggressive, \nsolemn Es muss sein! and that he harbored a deep desire to follow the spirit of \nParmenides and make heavy go to light. Reme mber that at one point in his life he \nbroke completely with his first wife and his son and that he was relieved when both his \nparents broke with him. What could be at t he bottom of it all but a rash and not quite \nrational move to reject what proclaimed itself to be his weighty duty, his Es muss sein!'? \nThat, of course, was an external Es muss sein! reserved for him by social convention, \nwhereas the Es muss sein! of his love for medicine was internal. So much the worse for \nhim. Internal imperatives are all the more powerful and therefore all the more of an \ninducement to revolt. \nBeing a surgeon means slitting open the surface of things and looking at what lies \nhidden inside. Perhaps Tomas was led to surgery by a desire to know what lies hidden \non the other side of Es muss sein! ; in other words, what remains of life when a person \nrejects what he previously considered his mission. \nThe day he reported to the good-natured wom an responsible for the cleanliness of all \nshop windows and display cases in Prague, and was confront ed with the result of his \ndecision in all its concrete and inescapable reality, he went into a state of shock, a state \nthat kept him in its thrall during the first fe w days of his new job. But once he got over \nthe astounding strangeness of his new life (i t took him about a week), he suddenly \nrealized he was simply on a long holiday.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 102\nHere he was, doing things he didn't ca re a damn about, and enj oying it. Now he \nunderstood what made people ( people he always pitied) happy when they took a job \nwithout feeling the compulsion of an internal Es muss sein! and forgot it the moment \nthey left for home every evening. This was t he first time he had felt that blissful \nindifference. Whenever anything went wrong on the operating tabl e, he would be \ndespondent and unable to sleep. He would even lose his taste for women. The Es \nmuss sein! of his profession had been like a vampire sucking his blood. \nNow he roamed the streets of  Prague with brush and pole, f eeling ten years younger. \nThe salesgirls all called him doctor (the Pr ague bush telegraph was working better than \never) and asked his advice about their colds, aching backs, and irregular periods. They \nseemed almost embarrassed to watch him douse the glass with water,  fit the brush on \nthe end of the pole, and start washing. If they could have left their customers alone in \nthe shops, they would surely have grabbed the pole from his hands and washed the \nwindows for him. \nMost of Tomas's orders came from large s hops, but his boss sent him out to private \ncustomers, too. People were still r eacting to the mass persecution of Czech \nintellectuals with the euphoria of solidarity, and when his former pati ents found out that \nTomas was washing windows for a living, t hey would phone in and order him by name. \nThen they would greet him with a bottle of c hampagne or slivovitz, sign for thirteen win-\ndows on the order slip, and chat with him for two hours, drinking his health all the while. \nTomas would move on to his next flat or shop in a capital mood. While the families of \nRussian officers settled in throughout the land and radios intoned ominous reports of \npolice functionaries who had re placed cashiered broadcaste rs, Tomas reeled through \nthe streets of Prague from one glass of wine to the next like someone going from party \nto party. It was his grand holiday. \nHe had reverted to his bachelor existence. Tereza was suddenly out of his life. The only \ntimes he saw her were when she came back from the bar late at night and he woke \nbefuddled from a half-sleep, and  in the morning, when s he was the befuddled one and \nhe was hurrying off to work. Each work day, he had sixteen hours to himself, an \nunexpected field of freedom. And from Tomas's early youth that had meant women. \nWhen his friends asked him how many women he  had had in his life,  he would try to \nevade the question, and when they pressed him further he would say, Well, two \nhundred, give or take a few. The envious among them accused him of stretching the \ntruth. That's not so many, he said by way of self-defense. I've been involved with \nwomen for about twenty-five years now. Divi de two hundred by twenty-five and you'll \nsee it comes to only eight or so new women a year. That's not so many, is it?  \nBut setting up house with Tereza cramped his style. Because of the organizational \ndifficulties it entailed,  he had been forced to relegate hi s erotic activities to a narrow \nstrip of time (between the operating room and home) whic h, though he had used it \nintensively (as a mountain farmer tills his narro w plot for all it is worth), was nothing like \nthe sixteen hours that now had suddenly been bestowed on hi m. (I say sixteen hours \nbecause the eight hours he spent washing wi ndows were filled with new salesgirls,\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 103\nhousewives, and female functionaries, each of whom represented a potential erotic \nengagement.) \nWhat did he look for in them? What attracte d him to them? Isn't making love merely an \neternal repetition of the same? \nNot at all. There is always the small part that is unimaginable. When he saw a woman \nin her clothes, he could natur ally imagine more or less w hat she would look like naked \n(his experience as a doctor supplementing hi s experience as a lover), but between the \napproximation of the idea and t he precision of reality t here was a small gap of the \nunimaginable, and it was this hiatus that gave him no rest. And then, the pursuit of the \nunimaginable does not stop with the revelations of nudity; it goes much further: How \nwould she behave while undressing? What woul d she say when he made love to her? \nHow would her sighs sound? How would her face distort at the moment of orgasm? \nWhat is unique about the I hides itself exactly in what is unimaginable about a person. \nAll we are able to imagine is what make s everyone like everyone else, what people \nhave in common. The individual I is what di ffers from the common st ock, that is, what \ncannot be guessed at or calculated, what must be unveiled, uncovered, conquered. \nTomas, who had spent the last  ten years of his medical pr actice working exclusively \nwith the human brain, knew that there was nothing more difficult to capture than the \nhuman I. There are many more resemblances bet ween Hitler and Einstein or Brezhnev \nand Solzhenitsyn than there are differences. Using numbers, we might say that there is \none-millionth part dissimilarity to nine hundred ninety-nine thousand nine hundred \nninety-nine millionths parts similarity. \nTomas was obsessed by the desire to discover and appropriate that one-millionth part; \nhe saw it as the core of his obsession.  He was not obsessed with women; he was \nobsessed with what in each of them is unimaginable, obsessed, in other words, with the \none-millionth part that makes a woman dissimilar to others of her sex. \n(Here too, perhaps, his passion for surgery and his passion for women came together. \nEven with his mistresses, he could never qui te put down the imaginary scalpel. Since \nhe longed to take possession of something deep inside them, he needed to slit them \nopen.) \nWe may ask, of course, why he sought that millionth part dissimilarity in sex and \nnowhere else. Why couldn't he fi nd it, say, in a woman's gait  or culinary caprices or \nartistic taste? \nTo be sure, the millionth part dissimilarity is present in all areas of human existence, but \nin all areas other than sex it is expo sed and needs no one to discover it, needs no \nscalpel. One woman prefers cheese at the end of the meal, another loathes cauliflower, \nand although each may demonstrate her originality thereby, it  is an originality that \ndemonstrates its own irrelevance and warns us to pay it no heed, to expect nothing of \nvalue to come of it.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 104\nOnly in sexuality does the millionth part dissimilarity become precious, because, not \naccessible in public, it must  be conquered. As recently as fifty years ago, this form of \nconquest took considerable time (weeks,  even months!), and the worth of the \nconquered object was proportional to the time the conquest took. Even today, when \nconquest time has been drastically cut, sex uality seems still to be a strongbox hiding \nthe mystery of a woman's I.  \nSo it was a desire not for pleasure (the pl easure came as an extr a, a bonus) but for \npossession of the world (slitting open the outstretched body of the world with his \nscalpel) that sent him in pursuit of women. \nMen who pursue a multitude of women fit neatly into two ca tegories. Some seek their \nown subjective and unchanging dream of a wom an in all women. Ot hers are prompted \nby a desire to possess the endless variety of the objective female world. \nThe obsession of the former is lyrical: what they seek in women is themselves, their \nideal, and since an ideal is by  definition something that c an never be found, they are \ndisappointed again and again . The disappointment that pr opels them from woman to \nwoman gives their inconstancy a kind of romantic excuse, so that many sentimental \nwomen are touched by their unbridled philandering. \nThe obsession of the latter is epic, and women see nothing the least bit touching in it: \nthe man projects no subjecti ve ideal on women, and sinc e everything interests him, \nnothing can disappoint him. This inability to be disappointed has something scandalous \nabout it. The obsession of the epic womanizer strikes people as la cking in redemption \n(redemption by disappointment). \nBecause the lyrical womanizer always runs after the same ty pe of woman, we even fail \nto notice when he exchanges one mistress fo r another. His friends perpetually cause \nmisunderstandings by mixing up his lovers and calling them by the same name. \nIn pursuit of knowledge, epic womanizers  (and of course Tomas belonged in their \nranks) turn away from conventional femini ne beauty, of which they quickly tire, and \ninevitably end up as curiosity collectors. They  are aware of this and a little ashamed of \nit, and to avoid causing their friends emba rrassment, they refrain from appearing in \npublic with their mistresses. \nTomas had been a window washer for nearly two years when he was sent to a new \ncustomer whose bizarre appearance struck him the moment he saw her. Though \nbizarre, it was also discreet, understated, wit hin the bounds of the agreeably ordinary \n(Tomas's fascination with curiosities had noth ing in common with Fellini's fascination \nwith monsters): she was very tall, quite a bi t taller than he was, and she had a delicate \nand very long nose in a face so unusual that it was impossible to call it attractive \n(everyone would have protested!), yet (in Tomas' s eyes, at least) it could not be called \nunattractive. She was wearing slacks and a white blouse, and looked like an odd \ncombination of giraffe, stork, and sensitive young boy. \nShe fixed him with a long, careful, search ing stare that was not  devoid of irony's \nintelligent sparkle. Come in, Doctor, she said.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 105\nAlthough he realized that she knew who he was,  he did not want to show it, and asked, \nWhere can I get some water?  \nShe opened the door to the bathroom. He saw a washbasin, bathtub, and toilet bowl; in \nfront of bath, basin, and bowl lay miniature pink rugs. \nWhen the woman who looked like a giraffe and a stork smiled, her eyes screwed up, \nand everything she said seemed full of irony or secret messages. \nThe bathroom is all yours, she said. You can do whatever your heart desires in it.  \nMay I have a bath? Tomas asked. \nDo you like baths? she asked. \nHe filled his pail with warm water and went into the living room. Where would you like \nme to start?  \nIt's up to you, she said with a shrug of the shoulders. \nMay I see the windows in the other rooms?  \nSo you want to have a look around? Her smile seemed to indicate that window washing \nwas only a caprice that did not interest her. \nHe went into the adjoining room. It was a bedroom with one large window, two beds \npushed next to each other, and, on the wall, an autumn landscape with birches and a \nsetting sun. \nWhen he came back, he found an open bottle of wine and two glasses on the table. \nHow about a little something to keep your strength up during the big job ahead?  \nI wouldn't mind a little something, actually, said Tomas, and sat down at the table. \nYou must find it interesting, seeing how people live, she said. \nI can't complain, said Tomas. All those wives at home alone, waiting for you. You mean \ngrandmothers and mothers-in-law. Don't you ever  miss your original profession? Tell \nme, how did you find out about my original profession?  \nYour boss likes to boast about you, said the stork-woman. After all this time! said \nTomas in amazement. When I spoke to her on the phone about having the windows \nwashed, she asked whether I didn't want you. She said you were a famous surgeon \nwho'd been kicked out of the hospital. Well, naturally she piqued my curiosity.  \nYou have a fine sense of curios ity, he said. Is it so obvi ous? Yes, in the way you use \nyour eyes. And how do I use my eyes? Yo u squint. And then, the questions you ask. \nYou mean you don't like to  respond? Thanks to her, t he conversation had been \ndelightfully flirtatious from the outset. Noth ing she said had any be aring on the outside \nworld; it was all directed inward, towards themselves. And because it dealt so palpably \nwith him and her, there was nothing simpler than to complement words with touch.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 106\nThus, when Tomas mentioned her squinting eyes, he stroked them, and she did the \nsame to his. It was not a spontaneous reac tion; she seemed to be consciously setting \nup a do as I do kind of game. An d so they sat there face to  face, their hands moving in \nstages along each other's bodies. \nNot until Tomas reached her groin did she star t resisting. He could not quite guess how \nseriously she meant it. Since much time  had now passed and he was due at his next \ncustomer's in ten minutes, he stood up and to ld her he had to go. Her face was red. I \nhave to sign the order slip, she said. But I haven't done a thing, he objected. That's my \nfault. And then in a soft, innocent voice she dr awled, I suppose I'll just have to order \nyou back and have you finish what I kept you from starting.  \nWhen Tomas refused to hand her the slip to si gn, she said to him sweetly, as if asking \nhim for a favor, Give it to me. Please? Then she squinted again and added, After all, I'm \nnot paying for it, my husband is. And you're not being paid for it, the state is. The \ntransaction has nothing whatever to do with the two of us.  \nThe odd asymmetry of the wom an who looked like a giraffe and a stork continued to \nexcite his memory: the combination of the flirtatious and the gawky; the very real sexual \ndesire offset by the ironic smil e; the vulgar conventionality of  the flat and the originality \nof its owner. What would sh e be like when they  made love? Try as he might, he could \nnot picture it. He thought of nothing else for several days. \nThe next time he answered her summons, t he wine and two glasses stood waiting on \nthe table. And this time everything went li ke clockwork. Before long, they were standing \nface to face in the bedroom (where the sun was setting on the birches in the painting) \nand kissing. But when he gave her his standar d Strip! command, she not only failed to \ncomply but counter-commanded, No, you first!  \nUnaccustomed to such a response, he was somewhat taken aback. She started to \nopen his fly. After ordering Strip! several mo re times (with comic failure), he was forced \nto accept a compromise. According to the rules of the game she had set up during his \nlast visit ( do as I do ), she took off his tr ousers, he took off her skirt, then she took off \nhis shirt, he her blouse, until at  last they stood there naked.  He placed his hand on her \nmoist genitals, then moved his fingers along to the anus, the spot he loved most in all \nwomen's bodies. Hers was unusually promi nent, evoking the long digestive tract that \nended there with a slight protru sion. Fingering her strong, healthy orb, that most \nsplendid of rings called by doctors the sphincter, he suddenly felt her fingers on the \ncorresponding part of his own anatomy. She was mimicking his moves with the \nprecision of a mirror. \nEven though, as I have pointed out, he had known approximately two hundred women \n(plus the considerable lot that had accrued  during his days as a window washer), he \nhad yet to be faced with a woman who was ta ller than he was, squi nted at him, and \nfingered his anus. To overcome his embarrassment, he forced her down on the bed. \nSo precipitous was his move that he caught her off guard. As her towering frame fell on \nits back, he caught among the red blotches on her face the frightened expression of \nequilibrium lost. Now that he was standing ov er her, he grabbed her under the knees\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 107\nand lifted her slightly parted legs in the air, so that they suddenly looked like the raised \narms of a soldier surrendering to a gun pointed at him. \nClumsiness combined with ardo r, ardor with clumsiness— they excited Tomas utterly. \nHe made love to her for a very long time, co nstantly scanning her red-blotched face for \nthat frightened expression of  a woman whom someone has tr ipped and who is falling, \nthe inimitable expression that moments earlier had conveyed excitement to his brain. \nThen he went to wash in t he bathroom. She follow ed him in and gave him long-drawn-\nout explanations of where the soap was and where the spong e was and how to turn on \nthe hot water. He was surprised that she went into such detail over such simple \nmatters. At last he had to tell her that he understood everything perfectly, and motioned \nto her to leave him alone in the bathroom. \nWon't you let me stay and watch? she begged. \nAt last he managed to get her out. As he washed and urinated in to the washbasin \n(standard procedure among Czech doctors), he had the feeling she was running back \nand forth outside the bathroom, looking for a way to break in. When he turned off the \nwater and the flat was suddenly  silent, he felt he was being  watched. He was nearly \ncertain that there was a peephole somewhere in the bathroom door and that her \nbeautiful eye was squinting through it. \nHe went off in the best of moods, trying to fix her essence in his memory, to reduce that \nmemory to a chemical formula capable of defining her uniqueness (her millionth part \ndissimilarity). The result was a formula consisting of three givens: \n1) clumsiness with ardor, \n2) the frightened face of one who has lost her equilibrium and is falling, and \n3) legs raised in the air like the arms of a soldier surrendering to a pointed gun. \nGoing over them, he felt the joy of having acquired yet another  piece of the world, of \nhaving taken his imaginary scalpel  and snipped yet another strip off the infinite canvas \nof the universe. \nAt about the same time, he had the follo wing experience: He had been meeting a \nyoung woman in a room that an old friend put at his dispos al every day until midnight. \nAfter a month or two, she reminded him of one of their early encounters: they had made \nlove on a rug under the window while it wa s thundering and lightning outside; they had \nmade love for the length of the storm; it had been unforgettably beautiful! \nTomas was appalled. Yes, he remembered maki ng love to her on the rug (his friend \nslept on a narrow couch that Tomas found uncomfortable), but he had completely \nforgotten the storm! It was odd. He could recall each of their times together; he had \neven kept close track of the ways they m ade love (she refused to be entered from \nbehind); he remembered several of the thi ngs she had said during intercourse (she\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 108\nwould ask him to squeeze her hips and to st op looking at her all the time); he even \nremembered the cut of her lingerie; but the storm had left no trace. \nOf each erotic experience his memory recorded only the steep and narrow path of \nsexual conquest: the first piece of verbal aggr ession, the first touch, the first obscenity \nhe said to her and she to him, the minor pe rversions he could make her acquiesce in \nand the ones she held out against. All else he excluded (almost pedantically) from his \nmemory. He even forgot where he had first seen one or another woman, if that event \noccurred before his sexual offensive began. \nThe young woman smiled dreamily as she we nt on about the storm,  and he looked at \nher in amazement and someth ing akin to shame: she had experienced something \nbeautiful, and he had failed to experience it  with her. The two ways in which their \nmemories reacted to the evening storm sharply delimit love and nonlove. \nBy the word nonlove I do not wish to imply t hat he took a cynical attitude to the young \nwoman, that, as present-day parlance has it, he looked upon her as a sex object; on the \ncontrary, he was quite fond of her, val ued her character and intelligence, and was \nwilling to come to her aid if ever she needed him. He was not  the one who behaved \nshamefully towards her; it was his memory , for it was his memory that, unbeknown to \nhim, had excluded her from the sphere of love. \nThe brain appears to possess a special area which we might call poetic memory and \nwhich records everything that charms or touches us, that makes our lives beautiful. \nFrom the time he met Tereza, no woman had t he right to leave the slightest impression \non that part of his brain. \nTereza occupied his poetic memory like a despot and exterminated all trace of other \nwomen. That was unfair, because the young wo man he made love to on the rug during \nthe storm was not a bit less worthy of poe try than Tereza. She shouted, Close your \neyes! Squeeze my hips! Hold me tight! ; she could not stand it that when Tomas made \nlove he kept his eyes open, focused and obser vant, his body ever so slightly arched \nabove her, never pressing against her skin. She did not want him to study her. She \nwanted to draw him into the magic stream  that may be entered only with closed eyes. \nThe reason she refused to get down on all f ours was that in that  position their bodies \ndid not touch at all and he c ould observe her from a distance of several feet. She hated \nthat distance. She wanted to me rge with him. That is why, looking him straight in the \neye, she insisted she had not  had an orgasm even though the rug was fairly dripping \nwith it. It's not sensual pleasure I'm after, sh e would say, it's happiness. And pleasure \nwithout happiness is not pleasure. In other words, she was pounding on the gate of his \npoetic memory. But the gate was shut. There was no room for her in his poetic memory. \nThere was room for her only on the rug. \nHis adventure with Tereza beg an at the exact point wher e his adventures with other \nwomen left off. It took place on the other side of the imperative that pushed him into \nconquest after conquest. He had no desire to uncover anything in Tereza. She had \ncome to him uncovered. He had made love  to her before he could grab for the\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 109\nimaginary scalpel he used to open the prostrate body of the world. Before he could start \nwondering what she would be like when they made love, he loved her. \nTheir love story did not begin until afterward:  she fell ill and he was unable to send her \nhome as he had the others. Kneeling by her as  she lay sleeping in his bed, he realized \nthat someone had sent her dow nstream in a bulrush basket. I have said before that \nmetaphors are dangerous. Love begins with a metaphor. Which is to say, love begins at \nthe point when a woman enters her first word into our poetic memory. \nRecently she had made another entry into hi s mind. Returning hom e with the milk one \nmorning as usual, she stood in the doorway with a crow wrapped in her red scarf and \npressed against her breast. It was the way gy psies held their babies. He would never \nforget it: the crow's enormous plaintive beak up next to her face. \nShe had found it half- buried, the way Cossacks used to dig their prisoners into the \nground. It was children, she said, and her words did more than state a fact; they \nrevealed an unexpected repugnance for peopl e in general. It reminded him of \nsomething she had said to him not long befor e: I'm beginning to be grateful to you for \nnot wanting to have children.  \nAnd then she had complained to him about a man who had been bothering her at work. \nHe had grabbed at a cheap necklace of hers and suggested that the only way she \ncould have afforded it was by doing some pr ostitution on the side. She was very upset \nabout it. More than necessary, thought Tomas. He suddenly felt dismayed at how little \nhe had seen of her the last two years; he had so few opportunities to press her hands in \nhis to stop them from trembling. \nThe next morning he had gone to work wit h Tereza on his mind. The woman who gave \nthe window washers their assignments told hi m that a private cust omer had insisted on \nhim personally. Tomas was not looking forward to it; he was afraid it was still another \nwoman. Fully occupied with Tereza, he was in no mood for adventure. \nWhen the door opened, he gave a sigh of relie f. He saw a tall, slightly stooped man \nbefore him. The man had a big chin and seemed vaguely familiar. \nCome in, said the man with a smile, taking him inside. \nThere was also a young man standing there. His face was bright red. He was looking at \nTomas and trying to smile. \nI assume there's no need for me to introduce you two, said the man. \nNo, said Tomas, and without returning the smile he held out his hand to the young man. \nIt was his son. \nOnly then did the man with the big chin introduce himself. \nI knew you looked familiar! said Tomas. Of course! Now I place you. It was the name \nthat did it."

    "raw_text": "\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 110\nThey sat down at what was like a small conference table. Tomas realized that both men \nopposite him were his own involuntary cr eations. He had been forced to produce the \nyounger one by his first wife, and the features of the older one had taken shape when \nhe was under interrogation by the police. \nTo clear his mind of these thoughts, he said, Well, which window do you want me to \nstart with?  \nBoth men burst out laughing. \nClearly windows had nothing to do with the case. He had not been called in to do the \nwindows; he had been lured into a trap. He had never before talked to his son. This \nwas the first time he had shaken hands with him. He knew him only by sight and had no \ndesire to know him any other way. As far as he was concerned, the less he knew about \nhis son the better, and he hoped the feeling was mutual. \nNice poster, isn't it? said the editor, point ing at a large framed drawing on the wall \nopposite Tomas. \nTomas now glanced around the room. The walls  were hung with interesting pictures, \nmostly photographs and posters. The drawing the editor had singled out came from one \nof the last issues of his paper before the Russians closed it down in 1969. It was an \nimitation of a famous recruitment poster fr om the Russian Civil War of 1918 showing a \nsoldier, red star on his cap and extraordinarily st ern look in his eyes, staring straight at \nyou and aiming his index finger at you. The original Russian caption read: Citizen, have \nyou joined the Red Army? It was replaced by  a Czech text that read: Citizen, have you \nsigned the Two Thousand Words?  \nThat was an excellent joke! The Two Thous and Words was the first glorious manifesto \nof the 1968 Prague Spri ng. It called for the radical demo cratization of the Communist \nregime. First it was signed by a number of intellectuals, and t hen other people came \nforward and asked to sign, and fi nally there were so many signatures that no one could \nquite count them up. When the Red Army in vaded their country and launched a series \nof political purges, one of t he questions asked of each citizen was Have you signed the \nTwo Thousand Words? Anyone who admitted to having done so was summarily dis-\nmissed from his job. \nA fine poster, said Tomas. I remember it well. Let's hope the Red Army man isn't \nlistening in on us, said the editor with a smile. \nThen he went on, without the smile: Seriously t hough, this isn't my flat. It belongs to a \nfriend. We can't be absolutely certain the polic e can hear us; it's only a possibility. If I'd \ninvited you to my place, it would have been a certainty.  \nThen he switched back to a playful tone. But t he way I' look at it, we've got nothing to \nhide. And think of what a boon it will be to Cz ech historians of the future. The complete \nrecorded lives of the Czech intelligentsia on  file in the police ar chives! Do you know \nwhat effort literary historians have put into reconstructing in detail the sex lives of, say,\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 111\nVoltaire or Balzac or Tolstoy? No such pr oblems with Czech writer s. It's all on tape. \nEvery last sigh.  \nAnd turning to the imaginary microphones in the wall, he sa id in a stentorian voice, \nGentlemen, as always in such circumstanc es, I wish to take this opportunity to \nencourage you in your work and to thank you on my behalf and on behalf of all future \nhistorians.  \nAfter the three of them had had a good laugh, the editor told the story of how his paper \nhad been banned, what the artist who designed the pos ter was doing, and what had \nbecome of other Czech painter s, philosophers, and writers. After the Russian invasion \nthey had been relieved of their positions  and become window washers, parking \nattendants, night watchmen, boilermen in pub lic buildings, or at best—and usually with \npull—taxi drivers. \nAlthough what the editor said was in teresting enough, Tomas was unable to \nconcentrate on it. He was thinking about his son. He remembered passing him in the \nstreet during the past two months. Appar ently these encounters had not been fortu-\nitous. He had certainly never expected to find him in the company of a persecuted \neditor. Tomas's first wife was an ortho dox Communist, and Tomas automatically \nassumed that his son was under her influen ce. He knew nothing about him. Of course \nhe could have come out and asked him w hat kind of relations hip he had with his \nmother, but he felt that it would have been tactless in the presence of a third party. \nAt last the editor came to the point. He said  that more and more people were going to \nprison for no offense other than upholding their own opini ons, and concluded with the \nwords And so we've decided to do something.  \nWhat is it you want to do? asked Tomas. \nHere his son took over. It was the first time he had ever heard him speak. He was \nsurprised to note that he stuttered. \nAccording to our sources, he said, political prisoners are being subjected to very rough \ntreatment. Several are in a bad way. And so  we've decided to draft a petition and have \nit signed by the most important Czech intellectuals, the ones who still mean something.  \nNo, it wasn't actually a stutter; it was mo re of a stammer, slowing down the flow of \nspeech, stressing or highlighting every word he uttered whether he wanted to or not. He \nobviously felt himself doing it, and his chee ks, which had barely regained their natural \npallor, turned scarlet again. \nAnd you've called me in for advice on likely candidates in my field? Tomas asked. \nNo, the editor said, laughing. We don't want your advice. We want your signature!  \nAnd again he felt flattered! Again he enjoyed the feeling t hat he had not been forgotten \nas a surgeon! He protested, but only out of  modesty, Wait a minute. Just because they \nkicked me out doesn't mean I'm a famous doctor!\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 112\nWe haven't forgotten what you wrote for our paper, said the editor, smiling at Tomas. \nYes, sighed Tomas's son with an alacrity Tomas may have missed. \nI don't see how my name on a petition can help your political prisoners. Wouldn't it be \nbetter to have it signed by people who hav en't fallen afoul of the regime, people who \nhave at least some influence on the powers that be?  \nThe editor smiled. Of course it would.  \nTomas's son smiled, too; he smiled the smile of one who understands many things. The \nonly trouble is, they'd never sign!  \nWhich doesn't mean we don't go after them, t he editor continued, or that we're too nice \nto spare them the embarrassment. He laughed. You should hear the excuses they give. \nThey're fantastic!  \nTomas's son laughed in agreement. \nOf course they all begin by claiming they ag ree with us right down the line, the editor \nwent on. We just need a diffe rent approach, they say. Something more prudent, more \nreasonable, more discreet. They're scared to si gn and worried that if they don't they'll \nsink in our estimation.  \nAgain Tomas's son and the editor laughed together. \nThen the editor gave Tomas a sheet of paper  with a short text calling upon the \npresident of the republic, in a relatively respectful manner, to grant amnesty to all \npolitical prisoners. \nTomas ran the idea quickly through his mind. Amnesty to po litical prisoners? Would \namnesty be granted because people jettisoned by the regime (and therefore \nthemselves potential political prisoners) request it of the president? The only thing such \na petition would accomplish was to keep po litical prisoners from being amnestied if \nthere happened to be a plan afoot to do so! \nHis son interrupted his thoughts. The main thing is to make the point that there still are \na handful of people in this country who are not  afraid. And to show who stands where. \nSeparate the wheat from the chaff.  \nTrue, true, thought Tomas, but what had that to do with polit ical prisoners? Either you \ncalled for an amnesty or you separated the wheat from t he chaff. The two were not \nidentical. \nOn the fence? the editor asked. \nYes. He was on the fence. But he was afraid to say so. There was a picture on the wall, \na picture of a soldier pointing a threatening finger at him and saying, Are you hesitating \nabout joining the Red Army? or Haven't you signed the Two Thousand Words yet? or\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 113\nHave you too signed the Two Thousand Words? or You mean you don't want to sign \nthe amnesty petition?! But no matter what the soldier said, it was a threat. \nThe editor had barely finished saying what  he thought about people who agree that the \npolitical prisoners should be granted amnesty  but come up with t housands of reasons \nagainst signing the petition. In his opinion, their reasons were just so many excuses \nand their excuses a smoke screen for cowardice. What could Tomas say? \nAt last he broke the silence with a laugh, and pointing to the poster on the wall, he said, \nWith that soldier threatening me, asking whether I'm going to sign or not, I can't \npossibly think straight.  \nThen all three laughed for a while. \nAll right, said Tomas after the laughter had died down. I'll think it over. Can we get \ntogether again in the next few days?  \nAny time at all, said the editor, but unfortunatel y the petition can't wait. We plan to get it \noff to the president tomorrow. \nTomorrow? And suddenly To mas recalled the portly policeman handing him the \ndenunciation of none other than this tall editor  with the big chin. Everyone was trying to \nmake him sign statements he had not written himself. \nThere's nothing to think over anyway, sa id his son. Although his words were \naggressive, his intonation border ed on the supplicat ory. Now that they were looking \neach other in the eye, Tomas noticed that when concentrating the boy slightly raised \nthe left side of his upper lip. It was an expr ession he saw on his own face whenever he \npeered into the mirror to det ermine whether it was clean-s haven. Discovering it on the \nface of another made him uneasy. \nWhen parents live with their children through chil dhood, they grow accustomed to that \nkind of similarity; it seems trivial to them or , if they stop and think about it, amusing. But \nTomas was talking to his son for the first time  in his life! He was not used to sitting face \nto face with his own asymmetrical mouth! \nImagine having an arm amputated and impl anted on someone else. Imagine that \nperson sitting opposite you and gesticulating with it in your face. You would stare at that \narm as at a ghost. Even though it was your  own personal, beloved arm, you would be \nhorrified at the possibility of its touching you! \nAren't you on the side of the persecuted? his son added, and Tomas suddenly saw that \nwhat was really at stake in this scene they were playing was not the amnesty of political \nprisoners; it was his relationship with his son. If he signed, their fates would be united \nand Tomas would be more or less obliged to befriend him; if he fa iled to sign, their \nrelations would remain null as before, though now not so much by his own will as by the \nwill of his son, who would renounce his father for his cowardice.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 114\nHe was in the situation of a chess player who cannot avoid checkmate and is forced to \nresign. Whether he signed the petition or not made not the slightest difference. It would \nalter nothing in his own life or in the lives of the political prisoners. \nHand it over, he said, and took the sheet of paper. \nAs if rewarding him for his dec ision, the editor said, That  was a fine piece you wrote \nabout Oedipus.  \nHanding him a pen, his son added, Some ideas have the force of a bomb exploding.  \nAlthough the editor's words of praise pleased him, his son's metaphor struck him as \nforced and out of place. Unfortunately, I was the only casualty, he said. Thanks to those \nideas, I can no longer operate on my patients.  \nIt sounded cold, almost hostile. \nApparently hoping to counteract the discordant note, the editor said, by way of apology, \nBut think of all the people your article helped!  \nFrom childhood, Tomas had associated the words helping people with one thing and \none thing only: medicine. How could an article help people? What were these two trying \nto make him swallow, reducing his whole lif e to a single small idea about Oedipus or \neven less: to a single primitive no! in the face of the regime. \nMaybe it helped people, maybe it didn't, he said (in a voice still cold, though he \nprobably did not realize it), but as a surgeon I know I saved a few lives.  \nAnother silence set in. Tomas's son broke it. Ideas can save lives, too.  \nWatching his own mouth in the boy's face, Tomas thought How strange to see one's \nown lips stammer. \nYou know the best thing about what you wr ote? the boy went on, and Tomas could see \nthe effort it cost him to speak. Your refu sal to compromise. Your clear-cut sense of \nwhat's good and what's evil, something we're beginning to lose. We have no idea \nanymore what it means to feel guilty. Th e Communists have the excuse that Stalin \nmisled them. Murderers have the excuse that their mothers didn't love them. And sud-\ndenly you come out and say: there is no excu se. No one could be more innocent, in his \nsoul and conscience, than Oedipus. And yet he punished himself when he saw what he \nhad done.  \nTomas tore his eyes away from his son's mouth and tried to focus on the editor. He was \nirritated and felt like ar guing with them. But it's all a misunderstanding! The border \nbetween good and evil is terribly fuzzy. I wasn't  out to punish anyone, either. Punishing \npeople who don't know what they've done is barbaric. The myth of Oedipus is a \nbeautiful one, but treat ing it like this. . . He had more  to say, but suddenly he remem-\nbered that the place might be bugged. He had not the slight est ambition to be quoted \nby historians of centuries to come. He was simply afraid of being quoted by the police.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 115\nWasn't that what they wanted from him, after all? A condemnation of the article? He did \nnot like the idea of feeding it to them from his own lips. Besides, he knew that anything \nanyone in the country said could be broadcast over the radio at any time. He held his \ntongue. \nI wonder what's made you change your mind, said the editor. \nWhat I wonder is what made me write the thi ng in the first place, said Tomas, and just \nthen he remembered: She had l anded at his bedside like a chil d sent downstream in a \nbulrush basket. Yes, that wa s why he had picked up the book and gone back to the \nstories of Romulus, Moses, and Oedipus. And now she was with him again. He saw her \npressing the crow wrapped in red to her brea st. The image of her brought him peace. It \nseemed to tell him that Tereza was alive, t hat she was with him in the same city, and \nthat nothing else counted. \nThis time, the editor broke the silence. I understand. I don't like the idea of punishment, \neither. After all, he added, smiling, we don't ca ll for punishment to be inflicted; we call \nfor it to cease.  \nI know, said Tomas. In the next few mo ments he would do something possibly noble \nbut certainly, and totally, useless (because it  would not help the polit ical prisoners) and \nunpleasant to himself (because it took place under conditions the two of them had \nimposed on him). \nIt's your duty to sign, his son added, almost pleading. \nDuty? His son reminding him of his duty? That was the worst word anyone could have \nused on him! Once more, t he image of Tereza appeared before his eyes, Tereza \nholding the crow in her arms. Then he reme mbered that she had been accosted by an \nundercover agent the day before. Her hands had started trembling again. She had \naged. She was all that mattered to him. She, born of six fo rtuities, she, the blossom \nsprung from the chief surgeon's sciatica,  she, the reverse side of all his Es muss sein! \n—she was the only thing he cared about. \nWhy even think about whether to sign or not? There was only one criterion for all his \ndecisions: he must do nothing that could ha rm her. Tomas could not save political \nprisoners, but he could make Tereza happy. He  could not really succeed in doing even \nthat. But if he signed the petit ion, he could be fairly certai n that she would have more \nfrequent visits from undercove r agents, and that her hands would tremble more and \nmore. \nIt is much more important to dig a half-buried crow out of the ground, he said, than to \nsend petitions to a president.  \nHe knew that his words were incomprehensible, but enjoyed them all the more for it. He \nfelt a sudden, unexpected intoxication come over him. It was the same black \nintoxication he had felt when he solemnly  announced to his wife that he no longer \nwished to see her or his son. It was the sa me black intoxication he had felt when he\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 116\nsent off the letter that meant the end of his career in medicine. He was not at all sure he \nwas doing the right thing, but he was sure he was doing what he wanted to do. \nI'm sorry, he said, but I'm not going to sign.  \nSeveral days later he read about the petition in the papers. \nThere was not a word, of course, about its be ing a politely worded plea for the release \nof political prisoners. None of  the papers cited a single sent ence from the short text. \nInstead, they went on at gr eat length and in vague, menacing terms about an anti-state \nproclamation meant to lay the foundation for a new campaign against socialism. They \nalso listed all the signatories, accom panying each of their names with slanderous \nattacks that gave Tomas gooseflesh. \nNot that it was unexpected. The fact that  any public undertaking (meeting, petition, \nstreet gathering) not organiz ed by the Communist Party wa s automatically considered \nillegal and endangered all the pa rticipants was common knowledge. But it may have \nmade him sorrier he had not signed the petition. \nWhy hadn't he signed? He could no longer qui te remember what had prompted his \ndecision. \nAnd once more I see him the way he appeared to me at the very beginning of the novel: \nstanding at the window and staring across the courtyard at the walls opposite. \nThis is the image from which he was born. As I have pointed out before, characters are \nnot born like people, of woman;  they are born of a situation, a sentence, a metaphor \ncontaining in a nutshell a basic human possibility that the author thinks no one else has \ndiscovered or said something essential abou t. But isn't it true t hat an author can write \nonly about himself? Staring impotently across a courtyard, at a loss for what to do; \nhearing the pertinacious rumbling of one's own stomach during a moment of love; \nbetraying, yet lacking the will to abandon the glamorous path of betrayal; raising one's \nfist with the crowds in the Grand Ma rch; displaying one's wit before hidden \nmicrophones—I have known all these situations, I have experienced them myself, yet \nnone of them has given rise to the person my curriculum vitae and I represent. The \ncharacters in my novels are my own unreal ized possibilities. That is why I am equally \nfond of them all and equally horrified by t hem. Each one has crossed a border that I \nmyself have circumvented. It is that cro ssed border (the border beyond which my own I \nends) which attracts me most. For beyond that  border begins the secret the novel asks \nabout. The novel is not the author's confession; it is an investigation of human life in the \ntrap the world has become. But enough. Let us return to Tomas. \nAlone in his flat, he stared ac ross the courtyard at the di rty walls of the building \nopposite. He missed the tall, stooped man wit h the big chin and the man's friends, \nwhom he did not know, who were not even mem bers of his circle. He felt as though he \nhad just met a beautiful woman on a railway platform, and before he could say anything \nto her, she had stepped into a sleeping car on its way to Istanbul or Lisbon.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 117\nThen he tried again to think through what he should have done. Even though he did his \nbest to put aside everything belonging to the realm of the emotions  (the admiration he \nhad for the editor and the irritation his son caused him), he was still not sure whether he \nought to have signed the text they gave him. \nIs it right to raise one's voice when others are being silenced? Yes. \nOn the other hand, why did the papers devote so much space to the petition? After all, \nthe press (totally manipulated by the state) could have k ept it quiet and no one would \nhave been the wiser. If they publicized the petition, then t he petition played into the \nrulers' hands! It was manna from heaven, the perfect start and justification for a new \nwave of persecution. \nWhat then should he have done? Sign or not? \nAnother way of formulating the question is, Is  it better to shout and thereby hasten the \nend, or to keep silent and gain thereby a slower death? \nIs there any answer to these questions? \nAnd again he thought t he thought we already know: Hu man life occurs only once, and \nthe reason we cannot determi ne which of our decisions ar e good and which bad is that \nin a given situation we can make only one dec ision; we are not granted a second, third, \nor fourth life in which to compare various decisions. \nHistory is similar to individual lives in th is respect. There is only one history of the \nCzechs. One day it will come to an end as surely as Tomas's life, never to be repeated. \nIn 1618, the Czech estates took courage and vented their ire on the emperor reigning in \nVienna by pitching two of his high officials out of a window in the Prague Castle. Their \ndefiance led to the Thirty Years War, whic h in turn led to the almost complete \ndestruction of the Czech nation. Should th e Czechs have shown more caution than \ncourage? The answer may seem simple; it is not. \nThree hundred and twenty years later, after the Munich Conference of 1938, the entire \nworld decided to sacrifice the Czechs' country to Hitler. Should the Czechs have tried to \nstand up to a power eight times their size? In  contrast to 1618, they opted for caution. \nTheir capitulation led to the Second World War, which in turn led to the forfeit of their \nnation's freedom for many decades or even centuries. Should they have shown more \ncourage than caution? What should they have done? \nIf Czech history could be repeated,  we should of course find it desirable to test the \nother possibility each time and compare the results. Without such an experiment, all \nconsiderations of this kind remain a game of hypotheses. \nEinmal ist keinmal. What happens but once might as well not have happened at all. The \nhistory of the Czechs will not  be repeated, nor will t he history of Europe. The history of \nthe Czechs and of Europe is a pair of ske tches from the pen of mankind's fateful\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 118\ninexperience. History is as light as indi vidual human life, unbearably light, light as a \nfeather, as dust swirling into the air, as whatever will no longer exist tomorrow. \nOnce more, and with a nostalgia akin to love , Tomas thought of the tall, stooped editor. \nThat man acted as though history were a finished picture rather than a sketch. He acted \nas though everything he did were to be repeated endlessly, to return eternally, without \nthe slightest doubt about his actions. He wa s convinced he was right, and for him that \nwas a sign not of narrowmindedness but of vi rtue. Yes, that man lived in a history \ndifferent from Tomas's: a history that was not (or did not realize it was) a sketch. \nSeveral days later, he was struck by another  thought, which I record here as an \naddendum to the preceding chapter: Somewhere out in space there was a planet where \nall people would be born again. They would be fully aware of the life they had spent on \nearth and of all the experience they had amassed here. \nAnd perhaps there was still another planet, where we would all be born a third time with \nthe experience of our first two lives. \nAnd perhaps there were yet more and more planets, where mankind would be born one \ndegree (one life) more mature. \nThat was Tomas's version of eternal return. \nOf course we here on earth (planet number one,  the planet of inexperience) can only \nfabricate vague fantasies of what will happen to man on thos e other planets. Will he be \nwiser? Is maturity within man's power? Can he attain it through repetition? \nOnly from the perspective of such a utopia is it possible to use the concepts of \npessimism and optimism with full justificati on: an optimist is someone who thinks that \non planet number five the history of mankind will be less bloody. A pessimist is one who \nthinks otherwise. \nOne of Jules Verne's famous novels, a favorite of Tomas's in his childhood, is called \nTwo Years on Holiday,  and indeed two years is the maxi mum. Tomas was in his third \nyear as a window washer. \nIn the last few weeks, he had come to realize (half sadly, half laughing to himself) that \nhe had grown physically tired (he had one, sometimes two erotic engagements a day), \nand that although he had not  lost his zest for women, he found himself straining his \nforces to the utmost. (Let me add that the strain was on his physical, not his sexual \npowers; his problem was with his breath, not with his penis, a state of affairs that had its \ncomical side.) \nOne day he was having trouble reaching a pros pect for his afternoon time slot, and it \nlooked as though he was going to  have one of his rare off days. He was desperate. He \nhad phoned a certain young wom an about ten times. A charming acting student whose \nbody had been tanned on Yugoslavia's nudist beaches with an evenness that called to \nmind slow rotation on a mechanized spit.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 119\nAfter making one last call from his final job of the day and starting back to the office at \nfour to hand in his signed order slips, he was stopped in the center of Prague by a \nwoman he failed to recognize. Wherever ha ve you disappeared to? I haven't seen you \nin ages!  \nTomas racked his brains to place her. Had she been one of his patients? She was \nbehaving like an intimate friend. He tried to answer in a manner that would conceal the \nfact that he did not recognize her. He was already thinking a bout how to lure her to his \nfriend's flat (he had the key in his pocket) when he realized from a chance remark who \nthe woman was: the budding actress with the perfect tan, the one he had been trying to \nreach all day. \nThis episode both amused and horrified him: it proved that he was as tired mentally as \nphysically. Two years of holiday could not be extended indefinitely. \nThe holiday from the operating table was al so a holiday from Tereza. After hardly \nseeing each other for six days, they would finally be together on Sundays, full of desire; \nbut, as on the evening when Tomas came back from Zurich , they were estranged and \nhad a long way to go before they could t ouch and kiss. Physica l love gave them \npleasure but no consolation. She no longer cr ied out as she had in the past, and, at the \nmoment of orgasm, her grimace seemed to  him to express suffering and a strange \nabsence. Only at night, in sleep, were they tenderly united. Holding his hand, she would \nforget the chasm (the chasm of daylight) t hat divided them. Bu t the nights gave him \nneither the time nor the means to protect and take care of her. In the mornings, it was \nheartrending to see her, and he feared for her: she looked sad and infirm. \nOne Sunday, she asked him to take her for a ride outside Prague. They drove to a spa, \nwhere they found all the st reets relabeled with Russian nam es and happened to meet \nan old patient of Tomas's. Tomas was devas tated by the meeting. Suddenly here was \nsomeone talking to him again as to a doctor , and he could feel his former life bridging \nthe divide, coming back to him with its pleasant  regularity of seeing patients and feeling \ntheir trusting eyes on him, those eyes he had pretended to ignore but in fact savored \nand now greatly missed. \nDriving home, Tomas pondered the catastrophi c mistake he had made by returning to \nPrague from Zurich. He kept hi s eyes trained on the road so as to avoid looking at \nTereza. He was furious with her. Her pr esence at his side felt more unbearably \nfortuitous than ever. What was she doing here next  to him? Who put her in the basket \nand sent her downstream? Why was his bed chosen as her shore? And why she and \nnot some other woman? \nNeither of them said a word the whole way. \nWhen they got home, they had dinner in silence. \nSilence lay between them like an agony. It grew heavier by the minute. To escape it \nthey went straight to bed. He woke her in the middle of the night. She was crying."

    "raw_text": "\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 120\nI was buried, she told him. I'd been buried for a long time. You came to see me every \nweek. Each time you knocked at the grave, and I came out. My eyes were full of dirt. \nYou'd say, 'How can you see?' and try to wipe the dirt from my eyes. \nAnd I'd say, 'I can't see anyway. I have holes instead of eyes.' \nAnd then one day you went off on a long journey, and I knew you were with another \nwoman. Weeks passed, and ther e was no sign of you. I was afraid of missing you, and \nstopped sleeping. At last you knocked at the grave again, but I was so worn down by a \nmonth of sleepless nights that I didn't think I could make it out of there. When I finally \ndid come out, you seemed disappointed. You sa id I didn't look well. I could feel how \nawful I looked to you with my sunken cheeks and nervous gestures. \nT'm sorry,' I apologized. 'I haven't slept a wink since you left.' \n' You see?' you said in a voice full of fa lse cheer. 'What you need is a good rest. A \nmonth's holiday!' \nAs if I didn't know what you had in mind! A month's holiday meant you didn't want to \nsee me for a month, you had another woman.  Then you left and I slipped down into my \ngrave, knowing full well that I'd have another mont h of sleepless nights waiting for you \nand that when you came back and I was uglier you'd be even more disappointed.  \nHe had never heard anything more harrowing. Holding her tightly in his arms and \nfeeling her body tremble, he thought he could not endure his love. \nLet the planet be convulsed with exploding bombs, the count ry ravished daily by new \nhordes, all his neighbors taken out and shot—he could accept it all more easily than he \ndared admit. But the grief implicit in Tere za's dream was something he could not \nendure. \nHe tried to reenter the dream  she had told him. He pictured himself stroking her face \nand delicately—she mustn't be aware of it—bru shing the dirt out of her eye sockets. \nThen he heard her say the unbelievably harro wing I can't see anyway. I have holes \ninstead of eyes.  \nHis heart was about to break; he felt he was on the verge of a heart attack. \nTereza had gone back to sleep; he could not. He pictured her death. She was dead and \nhaving terrible nightmares; but because she was dead, he was unable to wake her from \nthem. Yes, that is death: Tereza asleep, having terrible nightmares, and he unable to \nwake her. \nDuring the five years that had passed since the Russian army invaded Tomas's \ncountry, Prague had undergone cons iderable changes. The people Tomas met in the \nstreets were different. Half of his friends  had emigrated, and half  of the half that \nremained had died. For it is a fact which wi ll go unrecorded by historians that the years \nfollowing the Russian invasion were a period of funerals: the death rate soared. I do not\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 121\nspeak only of the cases (rather rare, of  course) of people hounded to death, like Jan \nProchazka, the novelist. Two weeks after his private conversations were broadcast \ndaily over the radio, he entered the hospital. The cancer  that had most likely lain \ndormant in his body until t hen suddenly blossomed like a rose. He was operated on in \nthe presence of the police,  who, when they realized he was doomed anyway, lost \ninterest in him and let him die in the arms of his wife. But many also died without being \ndirectly subjected to persecution; the hopelessness pervading the entire country \npenetrated the soul to the body, shattering t he latter. Some ran desperately from the \nfavor of a regime that wanted to endow them  with the honor of disp laying them side by \nside with its new leaders. That  is how the poet Frantisek Hrubin died—fleeing from the \nlove of the Party. The Minister of Culture,  from whom the poet di d everything possible \nto hide, did not catch up with  Hrubin until his funeral, when  he made a speech over the \ngrave about the poet's love for the Soviet Union. Per haps he hoped his words would \nring so outrageously false that they would wake Hrubin from th e dead. But the world \nwas too ugly, and no one decided to rise up out of the grave. \nOne day, Tomas went to the cr ematorium to attend the funeral of a famous biologist \nwho had been thrown out of  the university and the Academy of Sciences. The \nauthorities had forbidden mention of the hour of the funeral in the death announcement, \nfearing that the services would turn into a demonstration. The mour ners themselves did \nnot learn until the last moment that the body would be cr emated at half past six in the \nmorning. \nEntering the crematorium, Tomas did not understand what was happening: the hall was \nlit up like a film studio. Looki ng around in bewilderment, he noticed cameras set up in \nthree places. No, it was not television; it was the police. They were filming the funeral to \nstudy who had attended it. An old colleague of  the dead scientist, still a member of the \nAcademy of Sciences, had been brave enough to  make the funeral oration. He had \nnever counted on becoming a film star. \nWhen the services were over and everyone had  paid his respects to the family of the \ndeceased, Tomas noticed a group of  men in one corner of the hall and spotted the tall, \nstooped editor among them. The sight of him made Tomas feel how much he missed \nthese people who feared nothi ng and seemed bound by a deep  friendship. He started \noff in the editor's directi on with a smile and a greeting on his lips, but when the editor \nsaw him he said, Careful! Don't come any closer.  \nIt was a strange thing to say. Tomas was not su re whether to interpret it as a sincere, \nfriendly warning ( Watch out, we're being filmed; if you talk to us, you may be hauled in \nfor another interrogation ) or as irony ( If you weren't brave enough to sign the petition, \nbe consistent and don't try the old-pals act on us ). Whatever the message meant, \nTomas heeded it and moved o ff. He had the feeling that the beautiful woman on the \nrailway platform had not only stepped into the sleeping car but, just as he was about to \ntell her how much he admired he r, had put her finger over his lips and forbidden him to \nspeak.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 122\nThat afternoon, he h ad another interestin g encounter. He was washing the display \nwindow of a large shoe shop w hen a young man came to a halt right next to him, \nleaned up close to the window, and began scrutinizing the prices. \nPrices are up, said Tomas witho ut interrupting his pursuit of the rivulets trickling down \nthe glass. \nThe man looked over at him. He was a hos pital colleague of Tomas's, the one I have \ndesignated S., the very one who had sneered at Tomas while under the impression that \nTomas had written a statement of self-cri ticism. Tomas was delighted to see him \n(naively so, as we delight in unexpecte d events), but what he saw in his former \ncolleague's eyes (before S. had a chance to pull himself together) was a look of none-\ntoo-pleasant surprise. How are you? S. asked. \nBefore Tomas could respond, he realized t hat S. was ashamed of having asked. It was \npatently ridiculous for a doctor practicing  his profession to ask a doctor washing \nwindows how he was. \nTo clear the air Tomas came out with as spri ghtly a Fine, just fine!  as he could muster, \nbut he immediately felt that no matter how hard he tried (in fact, because he tried so \nhard), his fine sounded bitterly ironic. And so he quickly added, What's new at the \nhospital?  \nNothing, S. answered. Same as always. His response, too, though meant to be as \nneutral as possible, was completely inappropriate, and they both knew it. And they \nknew they both knew it. How can things be the same as always when one of them is \nwashing windows? How's the chief? asked Tomas. You mean you don't see him? \nasked S. No, said Tomas. \nIt was true. From the day he left, he had not  seen the chief surgeon even once. And \nthey had worked so well together; they had even tended to think of themselves as \nfriends. So no matter how he said it, his no had a sad ring, and Tomas suspected that \nS. was angry with him for bringing up the subject: like the chief surgeon, S. had never \ndropped by to ask Tomas how he was doing or whether he needed anything. \nAll conversation between the two former colleagues had become impossible, even \nthough they both regretted it, Tomas especia lly. He was not angry with his colleagues \nfor having forgotten him. If only he could make that clear to the young man beside him. \nWhat he really wanted to say was There's nothing to be ashamed of! It's perfectly \nnormal for our paths not to cross. There's nothing to get upset about! I'm glad to see \nyou! But he was afraid to say it, because ev erything he had said so far failed to come \nout as intended, and these sincere words, too, would sound sarcastic to his colleague. \nI'm sorry, said S. after a long pause, I'm in a real hurry. He held out his hand. I'll give \nyou a buzz.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 123\nDuring the period when his colleagues turned their noses up at him for his supposed \ncowardice, they all smiled at him. Now that  they could no longer scorn him, now that \nthey were constrained to respect him, they gave him a wide berth. \nThen again, even his old patie nts had stopped sending for him, to say nothing of \ngreeting him with champagne. The situation of the declasse intellectual was no longer \nexceptional; it had turned into something permanent and unpleasant to confront. \nHe went home, lay down, and fell asleep earlie r than usual. An hour later he woke up \nwith stomach pains. They were an old malady that appeared whenever he was \ndepressed. He opened the medicine chest and let out a curse: it was completely empty; \nhe had forgotten to keep it stocked. He tried to keep the pain under control by force of \nwill and was, in fact, fairly successful, but he could not fall asleep again. When Tereza \ncame home at half past one, he felt like chatting with her. He told her about the funeral, \nabout the editor's refusal to talk to him, and about his encounter with S. \nPrague has grown so ugly lately, said Tereza. \nI know, said Tomas. \nTereza paused and said softly, The best thing to do would be to move away.  \nI agree, said Tomas, but there's nowhere to go.  \nHe was sitting on the bed in his pajamas, and she came and sat down next to him, \nputting her arms around his body from the side. \nWhat about the country? she said. \nThe country? he asked, surprised. \nWe'd be alone there. You wouldn't meet that  editor or your old colleagues. The people \nthere are different. And we'd be getting back to nature. Nature is the same as it always \nwas.  \nJust then Tomas felt another stab in his stomach. It made him feel old, feel that what he \nlonged for more than anything else was peace and quiet. \nMaybe you're right, he said with difficulty. The pain made it hard for him to breathe. \nWe'd have a little house and a little garden, but  big enough to give Karenin room for a \ndecent run.  \nYes, said Tomas. \nHe was trying to picture what it  would be like if they did mo ve to the country. He would \nhave difficulty finding a new woman every w eek. It would mean an end to his erotic \nadventures.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 124\nThe only thing is, you'd be bore d with me in the country, said  Tereza as if reading his \nmind. \nThe pain grew more intense. He could not speak. It occurre d to him that his \nwomanizing was also something of an Es muss sein! — an imperative enslaving him. \nHe longed for a holiday. But for an absolute holiday, a rest from a// imperatives, from all \nEs muss sein! If he could take a rest (a permanent  rest) from the hospital operating \ntable, then why not from the world operating table, the one w here his imaginary scalpel \nopened the strongbox women use to hide their illusory one-millionth part dissimilarity? \nYour stomach is acting up again! Tereza excl aimed, only then realizing that something \nwas wrong. He nodded. \nHave you had your injection?  \nHe shook his head. I forgot to lay in a supply of medication.  \nThough annoyed at his carelessness, she stroked his forehead, which was beaded with \nsweat from the pain. \nI feel a little better now.  \nLie down, she said, and covere d him with a blanket. She went off to the bathroom and \nin a minute was back and lying next to him. \nWithout lifting his head from the pillow, he turned to her and nearly gasped: the grief \nburning in her eyes was unbearable. \nTell me, Tereza, what's wrong? Something's been going on inside you lately. I can feel \nit. I know it.  \nNo. She shook her head. There's nothing wrong.  \nThere's no point in denying it.  \nIt's still the same things, she said. \nThe same things meant her jealousy and his infidelities. \nBut Tomas would not let up. No, Tereza. This  time it's something different. It's never \nbeen this bad before.  \nWell then, I'll tell you, she said. Go and wash your hair.  \nHe did not understand. \nThe tone of her explanation was sad, unantagonistic, almost gentle. For months now \nyour hair has had a strong odor to it. It smells of female genitals. I didn't want to tell \nyou, but night after night I've had to breathe in the groin of some mistress of yours.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 125\nThe moment she finished, his stomach beg an hurting again. He was desperate. The \nscrubbings he'd put himself through! Body, hands, face, to make sure not the slightest \ntrace of their odors remained behind. He'd even avoided their fragrant soaps, carrying \nhis own harsh variety with him at all time s. But he'd forgotten about his hair! It had \nnever occurred to him! \nThen he remembered the woman who had str addled his face and wanted him to make \nlove to her with it and with the crown of his head. He hated her now. What stupid ideas! \nHe saw there was no use denying it. All he could do was laugh a silly laugh and head \nfor the bathroom to wash his hair. \nBut she stroked his forehead aga in and said, Stay here in bed.  Don't bother washing it \nout. I'm used to it by now.  \nHis stomach was killing him, and he longed for peace and quiet. I'll write to that patient \nof mine, the one we met at the spa. Do you know the district where his village is? No.  \nTomas was having great trouble talking. All he could say was, Woods . . . rolling hills . . \n.  \nThat's right. That's what we'll do. We'll go aw ay from here. But no talking now . . . And \nshe kept stroking his forehead. They lay t here side by side, neither saying a word. \nSlowly the pain began to recede. Soon they were both asleep. \nIn the middle of the night, he woke up and realized to his surprise that he had been \nhaving one erotic dream afte r the other. The only one he co uld recall with any clarity \nwas the last: an enormous naked woman, at least five time s his size, floating on her \nback in a pool, her belly from crotch to nav el covered with thick hair. Looking at her \nfrom the side of the pool, he was greatly excited. \nHow could he have been excited when his body was debilitat ed by a gastric disorder? \nAnd how could he be excited by the sight of a woman who would have repelled him had \nhe seen her while conscious? \nHe thought: In the clockwork of the head, tw o cogwheels turn opposite each other. On \nthe one, images; on the other, the body's r eactions. The cog carrying the image of a \nnaked woman meshes with the corresponding erection-command cog. But when, for \none reason or another, the wheels go out of phase and the excitement cog meshes with \na cog bearing the image of a swallow in flight, the penis rises at the sight of a swallow. \nMoreover, a study by one of Tomas's colleagues, a specialist  in human sleep, claimed \nthat during any kind of dream men have erections , which means that the link between \nerections and naked women is  only one of a thousand ways the Creator can set the \nclockwork moving in a man's head. \nAnd what has love in comm on with all this? Nothing. If a cogwheel in Tomas's head \ngoes out of phase and he is excited by seeing a swallow, it has absolutely no effect on \nhis love for Tereza.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 126\nIf excitement is a mechanism our Creator  uses for His own amusement, love is \nsomething that belongs to us  alone and enables us to fl ee the Creator. Love is our \nfreedom. Love lies beyond Es muss sein!  \nThough that is not entirely tr ue. Even if love is something other than a clockwork of sex \nthat the Creator uses for His own amusement, it is still attached to i t. It is attached to it \nlike a tender naked woman to the pendulum of an enormous clock. \nThomas thought: Attaching love to sex is one of the most bizarre ideas the Creator ever \nhad. \nHe also thought: One way of saving love from the stupidity of sex would be to set the \nclockwork in our head in such a way as to excite us at the sight of a swallow. \nAnd with that sweet thought he st arted dozing off. But on the very threshold of sleep, in \nthe no-man's-land of muddled concepts, he was suddenly certain he had just \ndiscovered the solution to all riddles, the key to all mysteries, a new utopia, a paradise: \na world where man is excited by seeing a swallow and Toma s can love Tereza without \nbeing disturbed by the aggressive stupidity of sex. \nThen he fell asleep. \nSeveral half-naked women were trying to wind themselves around him, but he was \ntired, and to extricate himself from them he opened the door leading to the next room. \nThere, just opposite him, he saw a young woman lying on her  side on a couch. She, \ntoo, was half-naked: she wore nothing but panties. Leaning  on her elbow, she looked \nup at him with a smile that said she had known he would come. \nHe went up to her. He was filled with a feeling of unutterable bliss at the thought that he \nhad found her at last and c ould be there with her. He sat down at her side, said \nsomething to her, and she said somethi ng back. She radiated calm. Her hand made \nslow, supple movements. All his life he had longed for the calm of her movements. \nFeminine calm had eluded him all his life. \nBut just then the dream began its slide back to reality. He found himself back in that no-\nman's-land where we are neither asleep nor awake. He was horrified by the prospect of \nseeing the young woman vanish before his eyes and said to himself, God, how I'd hate \nto lose her! He tried desperately to reme mber who she was, where he'd met her, what \nthey'd experienced together. How could he possibly forget when she knew him so well? \nHe promised himself to phone her first thing in the morning. But no sooner had he \nmade the promise than he realized he couldn' t keep it: he didn't know her name. How \ncould he forget the name of  someone he knew so well? By  that time he was almost \ncompletely awake, his eyes were open, an d he was asking himself, Where am I? Yes, \nI'm in Prague, but that woman, does she live here too? Didn't I meet her somewhere \nelse? Could she be from Switzerland? It took him quite some time to get it into his head \nthat he didn't know the wom an, that she wasn't from Pr ague or Switzerland, that she \ninhabited his dream and nowhere else.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 127\nHe was so upset he sat straight up in bed. Tereza was breathing deeply beside him. \nThe woman in the dream, he thought, was un like any he had ever met. The woman he \nfelt he knew most intimately of all had tu rned out to be a woman he did not even know. \nAnd yet she was the one he had always longed for. If a personal paradise were ever to \nexist for him, then in that paradise he woul d have to live by her side. The woman from \nhis dream was the Es muss sein! of his love. \nHe suddenly recalled the famous myth from Plato's Symposium: People were \nhermaphrodites until God split them in two,  and now all the halves  wander the world \nover seeking one another. Love is the longing for the half of ourselves we have lost. \nLet us suppose that such is the case, that  somewhere in the world each of us has a \npartner who once formed part of our body. Tomas's other part is the young woman he \ndreamed about. The trouble is, man does not find the other part of hi mself. Instead, he \nis sent a Tereza in a bulrush basket. Bu t what happens if he nevertheless later meets \nthe one who was meant for him, the other part of himself? Whom is he to prefer? The \nwoman from the bulrush basket or the woman from Plato's myth? \nHe tried to picture himself living in an ideal world with the young woman from the \ndream. He sees Tereza walking past the open windows of their ideal house. She is \nalone and stops to look in at  him with an infinitely sad expression in her eyes. He \ncannot withstand her glance. Again, he feels her pain in his own he art. Again, he falls \nprey to compassion and sinks deep into her soul. He leaps out of the wi ndow, but she \ntells him bitterly to stay where he feels happy, making those abrupt, angular \nmovements that so annoyed a nd displeased him. He grabs her nervous hands and \npresses them between his own to calm them . And he knows that time and again he will \nabandon the house of his happiness, time and again abandon his paradise and the \nwoman from his dream and betray the Es muss sein! of his love to go off with Tereza, \nthe woman born of six laughable fortuities. \nAll this time he was sitting up in bed and lo oking at the woman who was lying beside \nhim and holding his hand in her sleep. He felt  an ineffable love for her. Her sleep must \nhave been very light at the moment because she opened her eyes and gazed up at him \nquestioningly. \nWhat are you looking at? she asked. \nHe knew that instead of waking her he should lull her back to sleep, so he tried to come \nup with an answer that would plant the image of a new dream in her mind. \nI'm looking at the stars, he said. \nDon't say you're looking at the stars. That's a lie. You're looking down.  \nThat's because we're in an airplane. The stars are below us.  \nOh, in an airplane, said Tereza, squeezin g his hand even tighter and falling asleep \nagain. And Tomas knew that Tereza was looking out of the round window of an airplane \nflying high above the stars."

    "raw_text": "\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 128\nPART SIX \nThe Grand March \nNot until 1980 were we able to read in the Sunday Times how Stalin's son, Yakov, died. \nCaptured by the Germans during the Second World War, he was placed in a camp \ntogether with a group of British officers. They shared a latrine. Stalin's son habitually left \na foul mess. The British officers resented havi ng their latrine smear ed with shit, even if \nit was the shit of the son of the most powerful man in the world. They brought the \nmatter to his attention. He took offense. They brought it to his attention again and \nagain, and tried to make him clean the latrine. He raged, argued, and fought. Finally, he \ndemanded a hearing with t he camp commander. He wanted the commander to act as \narbiter. But the arrogant German refused to talk about shit. Stalin's son could not stand \nthe humiliation. Crying out to heaven in the most terrifying of Russian curses, he took a \nrunning jump into the electrified barbed-wire fence that surrounded the camp. He hit the \ntarget. His body, which would never again make  a mess of the Britishers' latrine, was \npinned to the wire. \nStalin's son had a hard time of it. All eviden ce points to the conclusion that his father \nkilled the woman by whom he had the boy. Y oung Stalin was therefore both the Son of \nGod (because his father was revered lik e God) and His cast-off. People feared him \ntwofold: he could injure them by both his wrath (he was, after all, Stalin's son) and his \nfavor (his father might punish his cast-off son's friends in order to punish him). \nRejection and privilege, happiness and woe—no one felt mo re concretely than Yakov \nhow interchangeable opposites are, how s hort the step from one pole of human \nexistence to the other. \nThen, at the very outset of the war, he fell prisoner to the Germans, and other \nprisoners, belonging to an incomprehensibl e, standoffish nation that had always been \nintrinsically repulsive to him, accused hi m of being dirty. Wa s he, who bore on his \nshoulders a drama of the highest order (as fallen angel and Son of God), to undergo \njudgment not for something sublime (in the r ealm of God and the angels) but for shit? \nWere the very highest of drama and the very lowest so vertiginously close? \nVertiginously close? Can proximity cause vertigo? \nIt can. When the north pole comes so close as to touch the south pole, the earth \ndisappears and man finds himsel f in a void that makes his head spin and beckons him \nto fall. \nIf rejection and privilege are one and the same, if there is no difference between the \nsublime and the paltry, if the Son of God can undergo j udgment for shit, then human \nexistence loses its dimensions and becomes unbearably light. When Stalin's son ran up \nto the electrified wire and hurl ed his body at it, the fence was like the pan of a scales \nsticking pitifully up in the air, lifted by the infinite lightness of a world that has lost its \ndimensions.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 129\nStalin's son laid down his life  for shit. But a death for shit is not a senseless death. The \nGermans who sacrificed their li ves to expand their country's  territory to the east, the \nRussians who died to extend their country's  power to the west—yes, they died for \nsomething idiotic, and their deaths have no meaning or general validity. Amid the \ngeneral idiocy of the war,  the death of Stalin's son stands  out as the sole metaphysical \ndeath. \nWhen I was small and would leaf through t he Old Testament retold for children and \nillustrated in engravings by Gustave Dore, I saw the Lord God standing on a cloud. He \nwas an old man with eyes, nose, and a long beard,  and I would say to myself that if He \nhad a mouth, He had to eat. And if He ate, He had intestines. But that thought always \ngave me a fright, because even though I come fr om a family that wa s not particularly \nreligious, I felt the idea of a divine intestine to be sacrilegious. \nSpontaneously, without any theological training, I, a child, grasped the incompatibility of \nGod and shit and thus came to question the basic thesis of Christian anthropology, \nnamely, that man was created in God's image. Either/or: either man was created in \nGod's image—and God has intestines!—or God lacks intestines and man is not like \nHim. \nThe ancient Gnostics felt as I did at the age of five. In the second century, the great \nGnostic master Valentinus resolved the dam nable dilemma by claiming that Jesus ate \nand drank, but did not defecate.  \nShit is a more onerous theol ogical problem than is evil.  Since God gave man freedom, \nwe can, if need be, accept t he idea that He is not responsible for man's crimes. The \nresponsibility for shit, however, rests entirely with Him, the Creator of man. \nIn the fourth century, Saint Jerome comple tely rejected the notion that Adam and Eve \nhad sexual intercourse in Paradise. On t he other hand, Johannes Sc otus Erigena, the \ngreat ninth-century theologian, accepted the idea. He believ ed, moreover, that Adam's \nvirile member could be made to rise like an arm or a leg, when and as its owner wished. \nWe must not dismiss this fancy as the recurrent dream of a man obsessed with the \nthreat of impotence. Erigena's  idea has a different meaning. If it were possible to raise \nthe penis by means of a simple command, then sexual excitement would have no place \nin the world. The penis woul d rise not because we are excited but because we order it \nto do so. What the great theologian found in compatible with Paradi se was not sexual \nintercourse and the attendant pleasure; what  he found incompatible with Paradise was \nexcitement. Bear in mind: There was pleasure in Paradise, but no excitement. \nErigena's argument holds  the key to a theological just ification (in other words, a \ntheodicy) of shit. As long as man was allowed to remain in Paradise, either (like \nValentinus' Jesus) he did not def ecate at all, or (as would se em more likely) he did not \nlook upon shit as something repellent. Not until after God expelled man from Paradise \ndid He make him feel disgust. Man began to hide what shamed him, and by the time he \nremoved the veil, he was blinded by a gr eat light. Thus, immediately after his \nintroduction to disgust, he was introduced to excitement. Without shit (in both the literal \nand figurative senses of the word), there would be no sex ual love as we know it, \naccompanied by pounding heart and blinded senses."

    "raw_text": "\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 130\nIn Part Three of this novel I told the tale of Sabina standing half-naked with a bowler hat \non her head and the fully dres sed Tomas at her side. Ther e is something I failed to \nmention at the time. While she was looking at herself in the mirror, excited by her self-\ndenigration, she had a fantasy of Tomas seating her on the toilet in her bowler hat and \nwatching her void her bowels. Suddenly her heart began to po und and, on the verge of \nfainting, she pulled Tomas down to the rug and immediately let out an orgasmic shout. \nThe dispute between those who believe that  the world was created by God and those \nwho think it came into being of its ow n accord deals with phenomena that go beyond \nour reason and experience. Much more real is the line separat ing those who doubt \nbeing as it is granted to man (no matter ho w or by whom) from those who accept it \nwithout reservation. \nBehind all the European faiths, religious and political, we find the first chapter of \nGenesis, which tells us that  the world was created properly , that human existence is \ngood, and that we are therefor e entitled to multiply. Let us call this basic faith a \ncategorical agreement with being. \nThe fact that until recently the word shit appeared in print as s— has nothing to do with \nmoral considerations. You can't claim that shit is immoral, after all! The objection to shit \nis a metaphysical one. The daily defecation session is daily proof of the unacceptability \nof Creation. Either/or: either shit is acceptable (in whic h case don't lock yourself in the \nbathroom!) or we are created in an unacceptable manner. \nIt follows, then, that the aesthetic ideal of  the categorical agreement with being is a \nworld in which shit is denied and everyone acts as though it did not exist. This aesthetic \nideal is called kitsch. \nKitsch is a German word born in the middle of the sentimental ni neteenth century, and \nfrom German it entered all Western languages. Repeated use, however, has obliterated \nits original metaphysical meaning: kitsch is the absolute denial of shit, in both the literal \nand the figurative senses of the word; kitsch excludes everything from its purview which \nis essentially unacceptable in human existence. \nSabina's initial inner revolt against Communism wa s aesthetic rather than ethical in \ncharacter. What repelled her  was not nearly so much the ugliness of the Communist \nworld (ruined castles transformed into cow s heds) as the mask of beauty it tried to \nwear—in other words, Communist kitsch. The model of Communist kitsch is the \nceremony called May Day. \nShe had seen May Day parades during the time when people were still enthusiastic or \nstill did their best to feign enthusiasm. T he women all wore r ed, white, and blue \nblouses, and the public, looking on from balconies and windows, could make out \nvarious five-pointed stars, hearts, and letters when the marchers went into formation. \nSmall brass bands accompanied the individual groups, keeping  everyone in step. As a \ngroup approached the reviewin g stand, even the most blase faces would beam with \ndazzling smiles, as if trying to prove they were  properly joyful or, to be more precise, in \nproper agreement. Nor were they merely expressing political agreement with \nCommunism; no, theirs was an agreement wit h being as such. The May Day ceremony\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 131\ndrew its inspiration from the deep well of  the categorical agree ment with being. The \nunwritten, unsung motto of the parade was not Long live Communism! but Long live life! \nThe power and cunning of Communist politics lay in the fact that it appropriated this \nslogan. For it was this idio tic tautology ( Long live life! ) which attracted people \nindifferent to the theses of Communism to the Communist parade. \nTen years later (by which time she was living in America), a friend of some friends, an \nAmerican senator, took Sabina for a drive in his gigantic car, his four children bouncing \nup and down in the back. The senator stopped the car in fr ont of a stadium with an \nartificial skating rink, and the children jum ped out and started running along the large \nexpanse of grass surrounding it. Sitting behind the wheel and gazing dreamily after the \nfour little bounding figures, he said to Sabina, Just look at them. And describing a circle \nwith his arm, a circle that was meant to take  in stadium, grass, and children, he added, \nNow that's what I call happiness.  \nBehind his words there was more than joy at seeing children run and grass grow; there \nwas a deep understanding of t he plight of a refugee from a Communist country where, \nthe senator was convinced, no grass grew or children ran. \nAt that moment an image of  the senator standing on a reviewing stand in a Prague \nsquare flashed through Sabina's mind. The sm ile on his face was the smile Communist \nstatesmen beamed from the height  of their reviewing stand to the identically smiling \ncitizens in the parade below. \nHow did the senator know that children m eant happiness? Could he see into their \nsouls? What if, the moment they were out of sight, three of them jumped the fourth and \nbegan beating him up? \nThe senator had only one argument in his favor: his feeling. When the heart speaks, the \nmind finds it indecent to object. In the real m of kitsch, the dictatorship of the heart \nreigns supreme. \nThe feeling induced by kitsch must be a kind the multitudes can share. Kitsch may not, \ntherefore, depend on an unusua l situation; it must derive from the basic images people \nhave engraved in their memories: the ungr ateful daughter, the neglected father, \nchildren running on the grass, the motherland betrayed, first love. \nKitsch causes two tears to flow in quick succession. The first tear says: How nice to see \nchildren running on the grass! \nThe second tear says: How nice to be mov ed, together with all m ankind, by children \nrunning on the grass! \nIt is the second tear that makes kitsch kitsch. \nThe brotherhood of man on earth will be possible only on a base of kitsch.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 132\nAnd no one knows this better than politicians. Whenever a camera is in the offing, they \nimmediately run to the nearest child, lift it in the air, kiss it on the cheek. Kitsch is the \naesthetic ideal of all politicians and all political parties and movements. \nThose of us who live in a society where va rious political tendencies exist side by side \nand competing influences cancel or limit  one another can manage more or less to \nescape the kitsch inquisition: the individual c an preserve his individual ity; the artist can \ncreate unusual works. But whenever a single political movement corners power, we find \nourselves in the realm of totalitarian kitsch. \nWhen I say totalitarian, what I mean is that everyt hing that infringes on kitsch must be \nbanished for life: every display of  individualism (because a de viation from the collective \nis a spit in the eye of the smiling brotherhood); every doubt (because anyone who starts \ndoubting details will end by doubting life itself); all irony (bec ause in the realm of kitsch \neverything must be taken quite seriously); and the mother who abandons her family or \nthe man who prefers men to women, thereby calling into question the holy decree Be \nfruitful and multiply.  \nIn this light, we can regard the gulag as a s eptic tank used by totalitarian kitsch to \ndispose of its refuse. \nThe decade immediately following the Sec ond World War was a time of the most \nhorrible Stalinist terror. It was the time when Tereza's father was arrested on some \npiddling charge and ten-year-old Tereza was thrown out of their flat. It was also the time \nwhen twenty-year-old Sabina was studying at  the Academy of Fine Arts. There, her \nprofessor of Marxism expounded on the following theory of socialist art: Soviet society \nhad made such progress that the basic co nflict was no longer bet ween good and evil \nbut between good and better. So  shit (that is, whatever is essentially unacceptable) \ncould exist only on the other side (in America,  for instance), and only from there, from \nthe outside, as something alie n (a spy, for instance), coul d it penetrate the world of \ngood and better.  \nAnd in fact, Soviet films, which flooded the ci nemas of all Communist countries in that \ncrudest of times, were saturated with incr edible innocence and chastity. The greatest \nconflict that could occur between two Russians was a lovers' misunderstanding: he \nthought she no longer loved him; she thought  he no longer loved her. But in the final \nscene they would fall into each other's arms, tears of happiness trickling down their \ncheeks. \nThe current conventional interpretation of these films is this: that they showed the \nCommunist ideal, whereas Communist reality was worse. \nSabina always rebelled against that interpretation. Whenever she imagined the world of \nSoviet kitsch becoming a reality, she fe lt a shiver run down her back. She would \nunhesitatingly prefer life in a real Communist regime with all its persecution and meat \nqueues. Life in the real Communist world wa s still livable. In the world of the \nCommunist ideal made real, in that world of  grinning idiots, she would have nothing to \nsay, she would die of horror within a week.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 133\nThe feeling Soviet kitsch evok ed in Sabina strikes me as  very much like the horror \nTereza experienced in her dream of bei ng marched around a swimming pool with a \ngroup of naked women and forced to sing c heerful songs with them while corpses \nfloated just below the surface of the pool. Tereza could not address a single question, a \nsingle word, to any of the women; the only response she would have got was the next \nstanza of the current song. She could not ev en give any of them a secret wink; they \nwould immediately have point ed her out to the man standi ng in the basket above the \npool, and he would have shot her dead. \nTereza's dream reveals the true function of kitsch: kitsch is a folding screen set up to \ncurtain off death. \nIn the realm of totalitarian kitsch, all ans wers are given in advance and preclude any \nquestions. It follows, then, that the true opponent of  totalitarian kitsch is the person who \nasks questions. A question is like a knife that slices through the stage backdrop and \ngives us a look at what lies hidden behind i t. In fact, that was exactly how Sabina had \nexplained the meaning of her paintings to Te reza: on the surface, an intelligible lie; \nunderneath, the unintelligible truth showing through. \nBut the people who struggle against what we call totalitari an regimes cannot function \nwith queries and dou bts. They, too, need certainties and simple truths to make the \nmultitudes understand, to provoke collective tears. \nSabina had once had an exhibit that was organized by a political organization in \nGermany. When she picked up the catalogue, t he first thing she saw was a picture of \nherself with a drawing of barbed wire superimposed on it. Inside she found a biography \nthat read like the life of a saint or martyr: she had suffered, struggled against injustice, \nbeen forced to abandon her ble eding homeland, yet was carry ing on the struggle. Her \npaintings are a struggle for happiness was the final sentence. \nShe protested, but they did not understand her. \nDo you mean that modern art isn't persecuted under Communism? \nMy enemy is kitsch, not Communism! she replied, infuriated. \nFrom that time on, she began to insert mystifications in  her biography, and by the time \nshe got to America she even managed to hide the fact that she was Czech. It was all \nmerely a desperate attempt to escape the kitsch that people wanted to make of her life. \nShe stood in front of  her easel with a half -finished canvas on it, the old man in the \narmchair behind her observing every stroke of her brush. \nIt's time we went home, he said at last with a glance at his watch. \nShe laid down her palette and went into the bathroom to wash. The old man raised \nhimself out of the armchair and reached for his cane, which was leaning against a table. \nThe door of the studio led directly out to t he lawn. It was growing dark. Fifty feet away\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 134\nwas a white clapboard house. The ground-floor windows were lit. Sabina was moved by \nthe two windows shining out into the dying day. \nAll her life she had proclaimed  kitsch her enemy. But hadn't she in fact been carrying it \nwith her? Her kitsch was her image of ho me, all peace, quiet, and harmony, and ruled \nby a loving mother and wise fa ther. It was an image that took shape within her after the \ndeath of her parents. The less her life resembled that sweetest of dreams, the more \nsensitive she was to its magic, and more than once she shed tears when the ungrateful \ndaughter in a sentimental film  embraced the neglected father  as the windows of the \nhappy family's house shone out into the dying day. \nShe had met the old man in Ne w York. He was rich and lik ed paintings. He lived alone \nwith his wife, also aging, in a house in the country. Facing  the house, but still on his \nland, stood an old stable. He  had had it remodeled into a studio for Sabina and would \nfollow the movements of her brush for days on end. \nNow all three of them were having supper together. The old woman called Sabina my \ndaughter, but all indicati ons would lead one to believe the opposite, namely, that \nSabina was the mother and that  her two children doted on her, worshipped her, would \ndo anything she asked. \nHad she then, herself on the threshold of  old age, found the parents who had been \nsnatched from her as a girl? Had she at last found the children she had never had \nherself? \nShe was well aware it was an illusion. He r days with the aging couple were merely a \nbrief interval. The old man was seriously il l, and when his wife was left on her own, she \nwould go and live with their son in Canada. Sabina's path of bet rayals would then \ncontinue elsewhere, and from the depths of her being, a silly mawkish song about two \nshining windows and the happy family living behi nd them would occasionally make its \nway into the unbearable lightness of being. \nThough touched by the song, Sabina did not take  her feeling seriously. She knew only \ntoo well that the song was a beautiful lie. As soon as kitsch is recognized for the lie it is, \nit moves into the context of non-kitsch, thus losing its authoritarian power and becoming \nas touching as any other human weakness. For none among us is superman enough to \nescape kitsch completely. No matter how we sco rn it, kitsch is an integral part of the \nhuman condition. \nKitsch has its source in the categorical agreement with being. \nBut what is the basis of being? God? Mankind? Struggle? Love? Man? Woman? \nSince opinions vary, there are various kitsches: Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, \nCommunist, Fascist, democratic, feminist, European, American, national, international. \nSince the days of the French Revolution, one half of Europe has been referred to as the \nleft, the other half as the right. Yet to define one or the other by means of the theoretical \nprinciples it professes is all but impossible. And no wonder: political movements rest not\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 135\nso much on rational attitudes as on the fant asies, images, words, and archetypes that \ncome together to make up this or that political kitsch. \nThe fantasy of the Grand March that Franz was so intoxicated by is the political kitsch \njoining leftists of all times and tendencies. The Grand March is the splendid march on \nthe road to brotherhood, equality, justice, happiness; it goes on and on, obstacles \nnotwithstanding, for obstacles there must be if the march is to be the Grand March. \nThe dictatorship of the prolet ariat or democracy? Rejection of the consumer society or \ndemands for increased productivity? The guillotine or an end to the death penalty? It is \nall beside the point. What makes a leftist a leftist  is not this or that theory but his ability \nto integrate any theory into the kitsch called the Grand March. \nFranz was obviously not a devotee of kitsch . The fantasy of the Grand March played \nmore or less the same role in his life as the mawkish song about the two brightly lit \nwindows in Sabina's. What political party did Franz vote for? I am afraid he did not vote \nat all; he preferred to s pend Election Day hiking in the mountains. Which does not, of \ncourse, imply that he was no longer touched by the Grand Ma rch. It is always nice to \ndream that we are part of a jubilant throng marching through the centuries, and Franz \nnever quite forgot the dream. \nOne day, some friends phoned him from Pa ris. They were planning a march on \nCambodia and invited him to join them. \nCambodia had recently been through American bombardment, a civil war, a paroxysm \nof carnage by local Communist s that reduced the small nation by a fifth, and finally \noccupation by neighboring Vietnam, which by then was a mere vassal of Russia. \nCambodia was racked by famine, and people we re dying for want of medical care. An \ninternational medical committee had rep eatedly requested permission to enter the \ncountry, but the Vietnamese had turned them down. The idea was for a group of \nimportant Western intellectuals to march to the Cambodian border and by means of this \ngreat spectacle performed before the eyes of the world to force the occupied country to \nallow the doctors in. \nThe friend who spoke to Franz was one he  had marched with through the streets of \nParis. At first Franz was thrilled by the invitation, but then his eye fell on his student-\nmistress sitting across the room in an armchai r. She was looking up at him, her eyes \nmagnified by the big round lenses in her gl asses. Franz had the feeling those eyes \nwere begging him not to go. And so he apologetically declined. \nNo sooner had he hung up than he regretted his decision. True, he had taken care of \nhis earthly mistress, but he had neglected hi s unearthly love. Wasn't Cambodia the \nsame as Sabina's country? A country occ upied by its neighbor's Communist army! A \ncountry that had felt the brunt of Russia's fist! All at once, Franz felt that his half-\nforgotten friend had contacted him at Sabina's secret bidding. \nHeavenly bodies know all and see all. If he went on the march, Sabina would gaze \ndown on him enraptured; she would understand that he had remained faithful to her.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 136\nWould you be terribly upset if I went on the march? he asked the girl with the glasses, \nwho counted every day away from him a loss, yet could not deny him a thing. \nSeveral days later he was in a large jet taking off from Pa ris with twenty doctors and \nabout fifty intellectuals (professors, writers,  diplomats, singers, actors, and mayors) as \nwell as four hundred reporters and photographers. \nThe plane landed in Bangkok. Four hundred and seventy doctors, intellectuals, and \nreporters made their way to the large ballr oom of an international hotel, where more \ndoctors, actors, singers, and professors of linguistics had gathered with several \nhundred journalists bearing notebooks, tape recorders, and cameras, still and video. On \nthe podium, a group of twenty or so Americans  sitting at a long table were presiding \nover the proceedings. \nThe French intellectuals with whom Franz had entered the ballroom felt slighted and \nhumiliated. The march on Cambodia had been their idea, and here the Americans, \nsupremely unabashed as usual, had not only tak en over, but had taken over in English \nwithout a thought that a D ane or a Frenchman might  not understand them. And \nbecause the Danes had long si nce forgotten that they onc e formed a nation of their \nown, the French were the onl y Europeans capable of protest. So high were their \nprinciples that they refused to protest in English, and made their case to the Americans \non the podium in their mo ther tongue. The Americans, not understanding a word, \nreacted with friendly, agreeing smiles. In the end, the French had no choice but to \nframe their objection in Engl ish: Why is this meeting in English when there are \nFrenchmen present?  \nThough amazed at so curious an objection, the Americans, still smiling, acquiesced: the \nmeeting would be run bilingually. Before it could resume, however, a suitable interpreter \nhad to be found. Then, every sentence had to resound in both English and French, \nwhich made the discussion take twice as long, or rather more than twice as long, since \nall the French had some English and kept interrupting the interpreter to correct him, \ndisputing every word. \nThe meeting reached its peak when a fam ous American actress rose to speak. \nBecause of her, even more photographer s and cameramen streamed into the \nauditorium, and every syllable she pronounc ed was accompanied by the click of \nanother camera. The actress spoke about su ffering children, abou t the barbarity of \nCommunist dictatorship, the human right to secu rity, the current threat to the traditional \nvalues of civilized society, the inalienable freedom of the human individual, and \nPresident Carter, who was dee ply sorrowed by the events in  Cambodia. By the time \nshe had pronounced her closing words, she was in tears. \nThen up jumped a young French doctor with a red mustache and s houted, We're here \nto cure dying people, not to pay homage to Pres ident Carter! Let's not turn this into an \nAmerican propaganda circus! We 're not here to protest against Communism! We're \nhere to save lives!  \nHe was immediately seconded by several other Frenchmen.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 137\nThe interpreter was frightened and did not dare  translate what they said. So the twenty \nAmericans on the podium looked on once mo re with smiles full of good will, many \nnodding agreement. One of them  even lifted his fist in the air because he knew \nEuropeans liked to raise their fists in times of collective euphoria. \nHow can it be that leftist intellectuals (because the doctor with the mustache was \nnothing if not a leftist intellectual) are willing to march against the interests of a \nCommunist country when Communism has always been considered the left's domain? \nWhen the crimes of the coun try called the Soviet Uni on became too scandalous, a \nleftist had two choices: either to spit on his former life and stop marching or (more or \nless sheepishly) to reclassify the Soviet Union as an obstacle to the Grand March and \nmarch on. \nHave I not said that what makes a leftist a leftist is the kitsch of the Grand March? The \nidentity of kitsch comes not from a political strategy but  from images, metaphors, and \nvocabulary. It is therefore possible to break the habit and march against the interests of \na Communist country. What is impossible, however, is to substitute one word for others. \nIt is possible to threaten the Vietnamese army  with one's fist. It is impossible to shout \nDown with Communism! Down with Communism! is a slogan belonging to the enemies \nof the Grand March, and anyone wo rried about losing face must  remain faithful to the \npurity of his own kitsch. \nThe only reason I bring all this up is to explain the misunderstanding between the \nFrench doctor and the American actress, who,  egocentric as she was, imagined herself \nthe victim of envy or misogyny. In point of fact, the French doctor displayed a finely \nhoned aesthetic sensibility: the phrases Pres ident Carter, our tradi tional values, the \nbarbarity of Communism all belong to the vocabulary of American kitsch and have noth-\ning to do with the kitsch of the Grand March. \nThe next morning, they all boarded buses and rode through Thailand to the Cambodian \nborder. In the evening, they pulled into a small village where they had rented several \nhouses on stilts. The regularly flooding river forced the villagers to live above ground \nlevel, while their pigs huddled down below. Franz slept in a room  with four other \nprofessors. From afar came the oinking of the swine, from up close the snores of a \nfamous mathematician. \nIn the morning, they climbed back into the buses. At a point about a mile from the \nborder, all vehicular traffic was prohibited. The border cr ossing could be reached only \nby means of a narrow, heavily guarded  road. The buses stopped. The French \ncontingent poured out of them only to find that again the Americans had beaten them \nand formed the vanguard of t he parade. The crucial moment had come. The interpreter \nwas recalled and a long quarrel ensued. At last everyone assented to the following: the \nparade would be headed by o ne American, one Frenchm an, and the Cambodian \ninterpreter; next would come  the doctors, and only then the rest of the crowd. The \nAmerican actress brought up the rear.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 138\nThe road was narrow and lined with minefields . Every so often it was narrowed even \nmore by a barrier—two cement blocks wound round with barbed wire—passable only in \nsingle file. \nAbout fifteen feet ahead of Franz was a famous German poet and pop singer who had \nalready written nine hundred thirty songs for peace and against war. He was carrying a \nlong pole topped by a whit e flag that set off his full bl ack beard and set him apart from \nthe others. \nAll up and down the long par ade, photographers and camera men were snapping and \nwhirring their equipment, dashing up to the front, pausing, inching back, dropping to \ntheir knees, then straightening up and runni ng even farther ahead. Now and then they \nwould call out the name of so me celebrity, who would t hen unwittingly turn in their \ndirection just long enough to let them trigger their shutters. \nSomething was in the air. People were slowing down and looking back. \nThe American actress, who had ended up in  the rear, could no longer stand the \ndisgrace of it and, determined to take the o ffensive, was sprinting to the head of the \nparade. It was as if a runner in  a five-kilometer race, who had been saving his strength \nby hanging back with the pack, had suddenly sprung forward and started overtaking his \nopponents one by one. \nThe men stepped back with embarrassed smiles,  not wishing to spoil the famous \nrunner's bid for victory, but the women yelled, Get back in line! This is no star parade!  \nUndaunted, the actress pushed on, a suit e of five photographers and two cameramen \nin tow. \nSuddenly a Frenchwoman, a prof essor of linguistics, grabbed the actress by the wrist \nand said (in terrible-sounding Eng lish), This is a parade for doctors who have come to \ncare for mortally ill Cambodians, not a publicity stunt for movie stars!  \nThe actress's wrist was locked in the linguistics professor's grip; she could do nothing to \npry it loose. What the hell do you think you're doing? she said (in perfect English). I've \nbeen in a hundred parades like this! You won't get  anywhere without stars! It's our job! \nOur moral obligation!  \nMerde said the linguistics professor (in perfect French). \nThe American actress understood and burst into tears. \nHold it, please, a cameraman called out and knelt at her feet. The actress gave a long \nlook into his lens, the tears flowing down her cheeks. \nWhen at last the linguistics professor let go of the American actress's wrist, the German \npop singer with the black beard and white flag called out her name.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 139\nThe American actress had never heard of him, but after being humiliated she was more \nreceptive to sympathy than usual and ran over  to him. The singer switched the pole to \nhis left hand and put his right arm around her shoulders. \nThey were immediately surrounded by new photographers and cameramen. A well-\nknown American photographer, havi ng trouble squeezing both th eir faces and the flag \ninto his viewfinder because the pole was so  long, moved back a few steps into the \nricefield. And so it happened that he stepped on a mine. An explosion rang out, and his \nbody, ripped to pieces, went flying through the air, raining a shower of blood on the \nEuropean intellectuals. \nThe singer and the actress were horrified and could not budge. They li fted their eyes to \nthe flag. It was spattered with blood. Once more they were horrified. Then they timidly \nventured a few more looks upward and began to  smile slightly. They were filled with a \nstrange pride, a pride they had never known before: the flag they were carrying had \nbeen consecrated by blood. Once more they joined the march. \nThe border was formed by a small river, but because a long wall, six feet high and lined \nwith sandbags to protect Thai sharpshooters, ran alongside it, it was invisible. There \nwas only one breach in the wa ll, at the point where a br idge spanned the river. \nVietnamese forces lay in wait on the other side, but they, too, were invisible, their \npositions perfectly camouflaged. It was clea r, however, that the moment anyone set \nfoot on the bridge, the invisible Vietnamese would open fire. \nThe parade participants went up to the wall and stood on tiptoe. Franz peered into the \ngap between two sandbags, trying to see what was going on. He saw nothing. Then he \nwas shoved away by a photographer, who felt that he had more right to the space. \nFranz looked back. Seven photographers were  perching in the mighty crown of an \nisolated tree like a flock of overgrown crows, their eyes fixed on the opposite bank. \nJust then the interpreter, at the head of  the parade, raised a large megaphone to her \nlips and called out in Khmer to the other side: These people are doctors; they request \npermission to enter the territory of Cambod ia and offer medical assistance; they have \nno political designs whatsoever and are guided solely by a concern for human life. \nThe response from the other side was a stunning silence. A silence so absolute that \neveryone's spirits sank. Only the cameras clicked on, sounding in the silence like the \nsong of an exotic insect. \nFranz had the sudden feeling that the Grand March was coming to an end. Europe was \nsurrounded by borders of silence, and the space where the Grand March was occurring \nwas now no more than a small platform in the middle of the planet. The crowds that had \nonce pressed eagerly up to the platform had long since departed, and the Grand March \nwent on in solitude,  without spectators. Yes, said Franz to himself, the Grand March \ngoes on, the world's indifferenc e notwithstanding, but it is growing nervous and hectic: \nyesterday against the American occupation of Vietnam, today against the Vietnamese \noccupation of Cambodia; yesterday for Israel, today for the Palestinians; yesterday for\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 140\nCuba, tomorrow against Cuba— and always against America; at times against \nmassacres and at times in support of other  massacres; Europe marches on, and to \nkeep up with events, to leave none of them ou t, its pace grows faster and faster, until \nfinally the Grand March is a procession of ru shing, galloping people and the platform is \nshrinking and shrinking until one day it will be reduced to a mere dimension-less dot. \nOnce more the interpreter shouted her challenge into the m egaphone. And again the \nresponse was a boundless and endlessly indifferent silence. \nFranz looked in all directions. The silence on the other side of the river had hit them all \nlike a slap in the face. Even the singer with the white flag and t he American actress \nwere depressed, hesitant about what to do next. \nIn a flash of insight Franz saw how laughabl e they all were, but instead of cutting him \noff from them or flooding him with irony, the thought made him feel t he kind of infinite \nlove we feel for the condemned. Yes, the Grand March was coming to an end, but was \nthat any reason for Franz to betray it? Wasn't his own life coming to an end as well? \nWho was he to jeer at t he exhibitionism of the peopl e accompanying the courageous \ndoctors to the border? What could they all do but put on a show? Had they any choice? \nFranz was right. I can't hel p thinking about the editor in Prague who organized the \npetition for the amnesty of polit ical prisoners. He knew perfe ctly well that his petition \nwould not help the prisoners. His true goal was not to free the prisoners; it was to show \nthat people without f ear still exist. That, too, was playacting. But he had no other \npossibility. His choice was not between play acting and action. His choice was between \nplayacting and no action at al l. There are situations  in which people are condemned to \nplayact. Their struggle with mute power (the mute power across the river, a police \ntransmogrified into mute microphones in the wa ll) is the struggle of  a theater company \nthat has attacked an army. \nFranz watched his friend from the Sorbonne li ft his fist and threaten the silence on the \nother side. \nFor the third time the interpreter shouted her challenge into the megaphone. \nThe silence she again received in respon se suddenly turned Franz's depression into \nrage. Here he was, standing on ly a few steps from the br idge joining Thailand to \nCambodia, and he felt an over whelming desire to run out ont o it, scream bloodcurdling \ncurses to the skies, and die in a great clatter of gunfire. \nThat sudden desire of Franz's reminds us of something; yes, it reminds us of Stalin's \nson, who ran to electrocute himself on the barbed wire when he c ould no longer stand \nto watch the poles of human existence come so  close to each other as to touch, when \nthere was no longer any diffe rence between sublime and s qualid, angel and fly. God \nand shit. \nFranz could not accept the fact that the glory of the Grand March was equal to the \ncomic vanity of its marchers, that the exquisite noise of European history was lost in an \ninfinite silence and that there was no longer any difference between history and silence.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 141\nHe felt like placing his own life on the scales; he wanted to  prove that the Grand March \nweighed more than shit. \nBut man can prove nothing of the sort. One pan of the scales held shit; on the other, \nStalin's son put his entire body. And the scales did not move. \nInstead of getting himself shot, Franz me rely hung his head and went back with the \nothers, single file, to the buses. \nWe all need someone to look at us. We can be divided into four categories according to \nthe kind of look we wish to live under. \nThe first category longs for the look of an in finite number of anonymous eyes, in other \nwords, for the look of the public. That is the case with the German singer, the American \nactress, and even the tall, stooped editor with  the big chin. He was accustomed to his \nreaders, and when one day the Russians banned his newspaper, he had the feeling \nthat the atmosphere was suddenly a hundred ti mes thinner. Nothing could replace the \nlook of unknown eyes. He thought he would suffocate. Then one day he realized that \nhe was constantly being followed, bugged, and surreptitiously photographed in the \nstreet. Suddenly he had anonymous eyes on him and he could breathe again! He \nbegan making theatrical speeches to the mi crophones in his wall. In  the police, he had \nfound his lost public. \nThe second category is made up of people who have a vital need to be looked at by \nmany known eyes. They are the tireless hosts of cocktail parties and dinners. They are \nhappier than the people in the firs t category, who, when they lose their public, have the \nfeeling that the lights have gone out in the room of their lives. This happens to nearly all \nof them sooner or later. P eople in the second category, on the other hand, can always \ncome up with the eyes they need. Marie-Claude and her daughter belong in the second \ncategory. \nThen there is the third category, the category of people who n eed to be constantly \nbefore the eyes of the person they love. Their situation is as dangerous as the situation \nof people in the first category. One day the eyes of their beloved will close, and the \nroom will go dark. Tereza and Tomas belong in the third category. \nAnd finally there is the fourth category, the rarest, the category of people who live in the \nimaginary eyes of those who are not pres ent. They are the dr eamers. Franz, for \nexample. He traveled to the borders of Ca mbodia only for Sabina. As the bus bumped \nalong the Thai road, he could feel her eyes fixed on him in a long stare. \nTomas's son belongs in the same category. Let  me call him Simon. (He will be glad to \nhave a Biblical name, like his father's.) T he eyes he longed for were Tomas's. As a \nresult of his embroilment in the petition ca mpaign, he was expelled from the university. \nThe girl he had been going out with was the niece of a vill age priest. He married her, \nbecame a tractor driver on a collective farm, a practicing Catholic, and a father. When \nhe learned that Tomas, too, was living in the country, he was thrilled: fate had made \ntheir lives symmetrical! This encouraged him to write Tomas a letter. He did not ask him \nto write back. He only wanted him to focus his eyes on his life.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 142\nFranz and Simon are the dream ers of this novel. Unlike Franz, Simon never liked his \nmother. From childhood he searched for his father. He was willing to believe his father \nthe victim of some sort of injustice that predated and expl ained the injustice his father \nhad perpetrated on him. He never felt angry wit h his father, because he did not wish to \nally himself with his mother, who continually maligned the man. \nHe lived with her until he was eighteen and had finished secondary school; then he \nwent off to Prague and the university. By that time To mas was washing windows. Often \nSimon would wait long hours to arrange an accidental encounter with Tomas. But \nTomas never stopped to talk to him. \nThe only reason he became involved with the big-chinned former editor was that the \neditor's fate reminded him of his father's . The editor had never heard of Tomas. The \nOedipus article had been forgo tten. It was Simon who told him about it and asked him \nto persuade Tomas to sign the petition. The only reason the editor agreed was that he \nwanted to do something nice for the boy, whom he liked. \nWhenever Simon thought back to  the day when they had met, he was ashamed of his \nstage fright. His father couldn't have liked hi m. He, on the other hand, liked his father. \nHe remembered his every word, and as time went on he saw how true they were. The \nwords that made the biggest impression on him were Punishing people who don't know \nwhat they've done is barbaric. When his girlfriend's uncle put  a Bible in his hands, he \nwas particularly struck by Jesus' words Forgive them, for they know  not what they do. \nHe knew that his father was a nonbeliever, but  in the similarity of the two phrases he \nsaw a secret sign: his father agreed with the path he had taken. \nDuring approximately his third year in the country, he received a letter from Tomas \nasking him to come and visit. Their meeting was a friendly one. Simo n felt relaxed and \ndid not stammer a bit. He probably did not realize that they did not understand each \nother very well. About four months later, he received a telegram saying that Tomas and \nhis wife had been crushed to death under a truck. \nAt about that time, he learned about a woman who had once been his father's mistress \nand was living in France. He found out her address. Because he desperately needed \nan imaginary eye to follow his life, he would occasionally write her long letters. \nSabina continued to receive letters from her sad village correspondent till the end of her \nlife. Many of them would re main unread, because she took less and less interest in her \nnative land. \nThe old man died, and Sabina moved to Califor nia. Farther west, farther away from the \ncountry where she had been born. \nShe had no trouble selling her paintings, and liked America. But only on the surface. \nEverything beneath the surface was alien to her. Down below, there was no grandpa or \nuncle. She was afraid of shutting herself into a grave and sinking into American earth. \nAnd so one day she composed a will in wh ich she requested that her dead body be \ncremated and its ashes thrown  to the winds. Tereza and  Tomas had died under the\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 143\nsign of weight. She wanted to die under the sign of lightness. She would be lighter than \nair. As Parmenides would put it, the negative would change into the positive. \nThe bus stopped in front of th e Bangkok hotel. No one any lo nger felt like holding \nmeetings. People drifted off in groups to si ghtsee; some set off for temples, others for \nbrothels. Franz's friend from the Sorbonne suggested they spend the evening together, \nbut he preferred to be alone. \nIt was nearly dark when he went out  into the streets. He ke pt thinking about Sabina, \nfeeling her eyes on him. Whenever he felt her long stare, he began to doubt himself: he \nhad never known quite what Sabina thought. It made him uncomfortable now as well. \nCould she be mocking him? Did she consider the cult he made of her silly? Could she \nbe trying to tell him it was time for him to grow up and devote himself fully to the \nmistress she herself had sent to him? \nPicturing the face with big round glasses,  he suddenly realized how happy he was with \nhis student-mistress. All at once, the Cambodia venture struck him as meaningless, \nlaughable. Why had he come? Only now did he know. He had come to find out once \nand for all that neither parades nor Sabina but rather the girl  with the glasses was his \nreal life, his only real life! He had come to find out that  reality was more than a dream, \nmuch more than a dream! \nSuddenly a figure emerged out of the semi-darkness and said something to him in a \nlanguage he did not know. He  gave the intruder a look that was startled but \nsympathetic. The man bowed and smiled and mu ttered something with great urgency. \nWhat was he trying to say? He seemed to be inviting him somewhere. The man took \nhim by the hand and started leading him away. Franz decided that someone needed his \nhelp. Maybe there was some sense in his coming all that distance. Wasn't he being \ncalled to help somebody? \nSuddenly there were two other men next to the first, and one of them asked him in \nEnglish for his money. \nAt that point, the girl with the glasses vanished from his thoughts and Sabina fixed her \neyes on him, unreal Sabina with her gran d fate, Sabina who had made him feel so \nsmall. Her wrathful eyes bored into hi m, angry and dissatisfied: Had he been had once \nagain? Had someone else abused his idiotic goodness? \nHe tore his arm away from the man, who was now holding on to his sleeve. He \nremembered that Sabina had al ways admired his strength. He seized the arm one of \nthe other men was lifting against him, and, tightening his grip, tossed him over his \nshoulder in a perfect judo flip. \nNow he was satisfied with himself. Sabina's eyes were still on hi m. She would never \nsee him humiliate himself again! She would never see him retreat! Franz was through \nwith being soft and sentimental! \nHe felt what was almost a cheerful hatred for these men. They had thought to have a \ngood laugh at him and his naivete! He stood there with his shoulders slightly hunched\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 144\nand his eyes darting back and forth between the two remaining men. Suddenly, he felt \na heavy blow on his head, and he crumpled immediately. He vaguely sensed being \ncarried somewhere. Then he was thrown into  emptiness and felt himself falling. A \nviolent crack, and he lost consciousness. \nHe woke up in a hospital in Geneva. Marie-Claude was leaning over his bed. He \nwanted to tell her she had no right to be there. He wanted them to send immediately for \nthe girl with the glasses. All his thoughts were with her. He want ed to shout that he \ncouldn't stand having anyone but her at his side. But he realized with horror that he \ncould not speak. He looked up at Marie-Claude with infinite  hatred and tried to turn \naway from her. But he could not move his body. His head,  perhaps? No, he could not \neven move his head. He closed his eyes so as not to see her. \nIn death, Franz at last bel onged to his wife. He belonged to her as he had never \nbelonged to her before. Marie- Claude took care of everything: she saw to the funeral, \nsent out the announcements, bought the wreaths, and had a black dress made—a \nwedding dress, in reality. Yes, a husband's funeral is a wife's true wedding! The climax \nof her life's work! The reward for her sufferings! \nThe pastor understood this very well. His fu neral oration was about a true conjugal love \nthat had withstood many tests to remain a haven of peace for the deceased, a haven to \nwhich he had returned at the end of his days. The colleagu e of Franz's whom Marie-\nClaude asked to speak at the graveside se rvices also paid homage primarily to the \ndeceased's brave wife. \nSomewhere in the back, supported by a friend,  stood the girl with the big glasses. The \ncombination of many pills and suppressed sobs gave her an attack of cramps before \nthe ceremony came to an end. She lurched forward, clutching her stomach, and her \nfriend had to take her away from the cemetery. \nThe moment he received the telegram from the chairman of the collective farm, he \njumped on his motorcycle. He a rrived in time to arrange fo r the funeral. The inscription \nhe chose to go under his father's name on the gravestone read:  \nHE WANTED THE KINGDOM OF GOD ON EARTH. \nHe was well aware that his father would not  have said it in those words, but he was \ncertain they expressed what his father actually thought. The kingdom of God means \njustice. Tomas had longed for a world in whic h justice would reign. Hadn't Simon the \nright to express his father's life in his own vocabulary? Of course he had: haven't all \nheirs had that right from time immemorial? \nA RETURN AFTER LONG WANDERINGS wa s the inscription adorning the stone \nabove Franz's grave. It can be interpreted in religious terms: the wanderings being our \nearthly existence, the return our return to God's embrace. But the insiders knew that it \nhad a perfectly secular meaning  as well. Indeed, Marie-Claude  talked about it every \nday:"

    "raw_text": "\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 145\nFranz, dear, sweet Franz! The mid-life crisis was just too much for him. And that pitiful \nlittle girl who caught him in her net! Why, she wasn't even pretty! (Did you see those \nenormous glasses she tried to hide behind?) Bu t when they start pushing fifty (don't we \nknow it!), they'll sell their souls for a fresh piece of flesh. Only his wife knows how it \nmade him suffer! It was pure moral torture!  Because, deep down, Franz was a kind and \ndecent man. How else c an you explain that crazy, desperat e trip to wherever it was in \nAsia? He went there to find death. Yes, Marie-Claude knew it for an absolute fact: \nFranz had consciously sought out death. In his last days, when he was dying and had \nno need to lie, she was the only person he asked for. He couldn't talk, but how he'd \nthanked her with his eyes! He'd fixed his ey es on her and begged to  be forgiven. And \nshe forgave him. \nWhat remains of the dying population of Cambodia? \nOne large photograph of an American actress holding an Asian child in her arms. \nWhat remains of Tomas? \nAn inscription reading HE WANTED THE KINGDOM OF GOD ON EARTH. \nWhat remains of Beethoven? \nA frown, an improbable mane, and a somber voice intoning Es muss sein!  \nWhat remains of Franz? \nAn inscription reading A RETURN AFTER LONG WANDERINGS. \nAnd so on and so forth. Before we are forgotten, we will be turned into kitsch. Kitsch is \nthe stopover between being and oblivion. \nPART SEVEN \nKarenin's Smile \nThe window looked out on a slope overgrow n with the crooked bodies  of apple trees. \nThe woods cut off the view above the slope, and a crooked line of hills stretched into \nthe distance. When, towards evening, a wh ite moon made its way into the pale sky, \nTereza would go and stand on the threshol d. The sphere hanging in the not yet \ndarkened sky seemed like a lamp they had forgott en to turn off in the morning, a lamp \nthat had burned all day in the room of the dead. \nNone of the crooked apple trees  growing along the slope could ever leave the spot \nwhere it had put down its roots, just as neither Tereza nor Tomas could ever leave their \nvillage. They had sold their car, their television set, and their radio to buy a tiny cottage \nand garden from a farmer who was moving to town. \nLife in the country was the only escape open to them, becaus e only in the country was \nthere a constant deficit of people and a surplus of living accommodations. No one\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 146\nbothered to look into the political past of people willing to go off and work in the fields or \nwoods; no one envied them. \nTereza was happy to abandon the city, the drunken barflies molesting her, and the \nanonymous women leaving the smell of their groins in Tomas's hair. The police stopped \npestering them, and the incident with the engi neer so merged with the scene on Petrin \nHill that she was hard put to  tell which was a dream and wh ich the truth. (Was the \nengineer in fact employed by the secret police? Perhaps he was, perhaps not. Men who \nuse borrowed flats for rendezvous and never make love to the same woman twice are \nnot so rare.) \nIn any case, Tereza was happy and felt that  she had at last reached her goal: she and \nTomas were together and alone. Alone? Let me  be more precise: living alone meant \nbreaking with all their former friends and ac quaintances, cutting their life in two like a \nribbon; however, they felt per fectly at home in the company  of the country people they \nworked with, and they sometimes exchanged visits with them. \nThe day they met the chairman of the local collective farm at the spa that had Russian \nstreet names, Tereza discovered in herself a picture of country life originating in \nmemories of books she had read or in her ancestors. It was a harmonious world; \neveryone came together in one big happy fa mily with common interests and routines: \nchurch services on Sundays, a tavern w here the men could get away from their \nwomenfolk, and a hall in the tavern where a band played on Saturdays and the villagers \ndanced. \nUnder Communism, however, vill age life no longer fit the ag e-old pattern. The church \nwas in the neighboring village, and no one went there; the tavern had been turned into \noffices, so the men had nowhere to meet and drink beer, the young people nowhere to \ndance. Celebrating church holidays wa s forbidden, and no one cared about their \nsecular replacements. The nearest cinema was in a town fifteen miles away. So, at the \nend of a day's work filled with boisterous s houting and relaxed cha tter, they would all \nshut themselves up within their four wa lls and, surrounded by co ntemporary furniture \nemanating bad taste like a cold draft, stare at  the refulgent television screen. They \nnever paid one another visits besides dropping in on a neig hbor for a word or two \nbefore supper. They all dreamed of moving into town. The country offered them nothing \nin the way of even a minimally interesting life. \nPerhaps it was the fact  that no one wished to settle ther e that caused the state to lose \nits power over the countryside. A farmer who no longer owns his own land and is \nmerely a laborer tilling the soil forms no a llegiance to either region or work; he has \nnothing to lose, nothing to fear for. As a result of such apathy, the countryside had \nmaintained more than a modicum of autonomy and freedom. The chairman of the \ncollective farm was not brought in from outside (as were all high-level managers in the \ncity); he was elected by the villagers from among themselves. \nBecause everyone wanted to leave, Tereza and Tomas were in an exceptional position: \nthey had come voluntarily. If t he other villagers took adv antage of every opportunity to \nmake day trips to the surrounding towns, Tereza and Tomas were content to remain\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 147\nwhere they were, which meant  that before long they knew  the villagers better than the \nvillagers knew one another. \nThe collective farm chairman became a truly cl ose friend. He had a wife, four children, \nand a pig he raised like a dog. The pig's na me was Mefisto, and he was the pride and \nmain attraction of the vill age. He would answer his mast er's call and was always clean \nand pink; he paraded about on his hoofs like a heavy-thighed woman in high heels. \nWhen Karenin first saw Mefisto, he was very upset and circled him, sniffing, for a long \ntime. But he soon made friends with him, even to the point of preferring him to the \nvillage dogs. Indeed, he had nothing but scorn for the dogs, because they were all \nchained to their doghouses and never stopped their silly, unmotivated barking. Karenin \ncorrectly assessed the value of being one of  a kind, and I can state without compunc-\ntion that he greatly appreciated his friendship with the pig. \nThe chairman was glad to be able to help his former surgeon, though at the same time \nsad that he could do nothing more. Tomas became the driver of the pickup truck that \ntook the farm workers out to the fields and hauled equipment. \nThe collective farm had four large cow sheds as  well as a small st able of forty heifers. \nTereza was charged with looking after them and taking them out to pasture twice a day. \nBecause the closer, easily accessible me adows would eventually  be mowed, she had \nto take her herd into the surrounding hills  for grazing, gradually moving farther and \nfarther out and, in the course of the year, covering all the pastureland round about. As \nin her small-town youth, she was never without a book, and the minute she reached the \nday's pasture she would open it and read. \nKarenin always kept her company. He learned to bark at the young cows when they got \ntoo frisky and tried to go off on their own; he did so with obvious zest. He was definitely \nthe happiest of the th ree. Never before had his position as keeper of the clock been so \nrespected. The country was no place for impr ovisation; the time in which Tereza and \nTomas lived was growing closer to the regularity of his time. \nOne day, after lunch (a time when they bot h had an hour to themse lves), they took a \nwalk with Karenin up the slope behind their cottage. \nI don't like the way he's running, said Tereza. \nKarenin was limping on a hind leg. Tomas bent down and carefully felt all along it. Near \nthe hock he found a small bump. \nThe next day he sat him in the front seat of the pickup and drove, during his rounds, to \nthe neighboring village, where the local vete rinarian lived. A week later, he paid him \nanother visit. He came home with the news that Karenin had cancer. \nWithin three days, Tomas himself, with th e vet in attendance, had operated on him. \nWhen Tomas brought him home, Karenin had not quite come out  of the anesthesia. He \nlay on the rug next to thei r bed with his eyes open, whimper ing, his thigh shaved bare \nand the incision and six stitches painfully visible.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 148\nAt last he tried to stand up. He failed. \nTereza was terrified that he would never walk again. \nDon't worry, said Tomas. He's still under the anesthetic.  \nShe tried to pick him up, but he snapped at her. It was the fi rst time he'd ever tried to \nbite Tereza! \nHe doesn't know who you are, said Tomas. He doesn't recognize you.  \nThey lifted him onto their bed, where he quickly fell asleep, as did they. \nAt three o'clock that morning, he suddenly woke them up, wagging his tail and climbing \nall over them, cuddling up to them, unable to have his fill. \nIt was the first time he'd ever got them up, too! He had always waited  until one of them \nwoke up before he dared jump on them. \nBut when he suddenly came to in the middle of  the night, he could not control himself. \nWho can tell what distances he covered on  his way back? Who knows what phantoms \nhe battled? And now that he was at home with his dear ones, he felt compelled to share \nhis overwhelming joy, a joy of return and rebirth. \nThe very beginning of Genesis tells us that  God created man in order to give him \ndominion over fish and fowl and all creatur es. Of course, Genesis was written by a \nman, not a horse. There is no certainty that God actually did grant man dominion over \nother creatures. What seems more  likely, in fact, is that man invented God to sanctify \nthe dominion that he had usurped for himself over the cow and the horse. Yes, the right \nto kill a deer or a cow is the only thing al l of mankind can agree upon, even during the \nbloodiest of wars. \nThe reason we take that right for granted is that we stand at the t op of the hierarchy. \nBut let a third party enter the game—a vi sitor from another planet, for example, \nsomeone to whom God says, Thou shalt have dominion over creatures of all other stars \n—and all at once taking Genesis for grant ed becomes problematical. Perhaps a man \nhitched to the cart of a Martian or roasted on the spit by inhabitants of the Milky Way \nwill recall the veal cutlet he used to slice on his dinner plate and a pologize (belatedly!) \nto the cow. \nWalking along with her heifers, driving them in front of her, Tereza was constantly \nobliged to use discipline, bec ause young cows are frisky and like to run off into the \nfields. Karenin kept her company. He had been going along daily to the pasture with her \nfor two years. He always enjoyed being st rict with the heifers, barking at them, \nasserting his authority. (His God had given him dominion over cows, and he was proud \nof it.) Today, however, he was having great  trouble making his way, and hobbled along \non three legs; the fourth had a wound on it, and the wound was festering. Tereza kept \nbending down and stroking his back. Two wee ks after the operation, it became clear \nthat the cancer had continued to spread and that Karenin would fare worse and worse.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 149\nAlong the way, they met a neighbor who was hurrying off to a cow shed in her rubber \nboots. The woman stopped long enough to ask, What's wrong with the dog? It seems to \nbe limping. He has cancer, said Tereza. T here's no hope. And the lump in her throat \nkept her from going on. The woman noticed Te reza's tears and nearly lost her temper: \nGood heavens! Don't tell me you're going to bawl your head off ov er a dog! She was \nnot being vicious; she was a kind woman and merely wanted to comfort Tereza. Tereza \nunderstood, and had spent enough time  in the country to realize that if the local \ninhabitants loved every rabbit as she loved Karenin, they would be unable to kill any of \nthem and they and their animals would soon starve to death. Still, the woman's words \nstruck her as less than friendly. I understand,  she answered without protest, but quickly \nturned her back and went her way. The love she bore her dog made her feel cut off, \nisolated. With a sad smile, she told herself that she needed to hide it more than she \nwould an affair. People are indignant at the thought of someone loving a dog. But if the \nneighbor had discovered that Tereza had been unfaithful to Tomas, she would have \ngiven Tereza a playful pat on the back as a sign of secret solidarity. \nBe that as it may, Tereza  continued on her path, and, wa tching her heifers rub against \none another, she thought what nice animals they were. Ca lm, guileless, and sometimes \nchildishly animated, they looked like fat fi fty-year-olds pretending they were fourteen. \nThere was nothing more touching than cows at  play. Tereza took pleasure in their \nantics and could not help thinking (it is an idea that kept  coming back to her during her \ntwo years in the country) that man is as much a parasite on the cow as the tapeworm is \non man: We have sucked their udders like l eeches. Man the cow parasite is probably \nhow non-man defines man in his zoology books. \nNow, we may treat this definition as a jo ke and dismiss it with a condescending laugh. \nBut since Tereza took it seriously, she found herself in a precarious position: her ideas \nwere dangerous and distanced her  from the rest of mank ind. Even though Genesis \nsays that God gave man domini on over all animals, we can also construe it to mean \nthat He merely entrusted them to man's care . Man was not the planet's master, merely \nits administrator, and therefore eventually responsible for his administration. Descartes \ntook a decisive step forward: he made man maitre et proprietaire de la nature. And \nsurely there is a deep connection between that  step and the fact that he was also the \none who point-blank denied animals a soul. Man is master and proprietor, says \nDescartes, whereas the beast is merely  an automaton, an animated machine, a \nmachina animata. When an animal laments, it is not a lament; it is merely the rasp of a \npoorly functioning mechanism. When a wagon wheel grates, the wagon is not in pain; it \nsimply needs oiling. Thus, we have no reas on to grieve for a dog being carved up alive \nin the laboratory. \nWhile the heifers grazed, Tereza sat on a stump with Karenin at her side, his head \nresting in her lap. She recalled reading a two-line filler in the papers ten or so years ago \nabout how all the dogs in a certain Russian city had been summarily shot. It was that \ninconspicuous and seemingly insignificant littl e article that had brought home to her for \nthe first time the sheer horror of her country's oversized neighbor. \nThat little article was a premonition of thi ngs to come. The first years following the \nRussian invasion could not yet be characterized as a reign of terror. Because practically\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 150\nno one in the entire nation agreed with the occupation regime, the Russians had to \nferret out the few exceptions and push them into power. But where could they look? All \nfaith in Communism and love for Russia was dead. So they sought people who wished \nto get back at life for something, people wit h revenge on the brain. Then they had to \nfocus, cultivate, and maintain those people' s aggressiveness, give them a temporary \nsubstitute to practice on. \nThe substitute they lit upon was animals. \nAll at once the papers st arted coming out with cycles of features and organized letters-\nto-the-editor campaigns demanding, for example, the extermination of all pigeons within \ncity limits. And the pigeons would be exterminated. But the major drive was directed \nagainst dogs. People were still disconsolate over the catastrophe of the occupation, but \nradio, television, and the press went on and on about dogs: how they soil our streets \nand parks, endanger our children's health, fulfill no useful function, yet must be fed. \nThey whipped up such a psychotic fever that  Tereza had been afraid  that the crazed \nmob would do harm to Karenin. Only after a year did the accumulated malice (which \nuntil then had been vented, for t he sake of training, on animals) find its true goal: \npeople. People started being removed from their jobs, arrested,  put on trial. At last the \nanimals could breathe freely. \nTereza kept stroking Karenin's head, which was quietly resting in her lap, while \nsomething like the following ran through her mind: There's no particular merit in being \nnice to one's fellow man. She had to treat  the other villagers decently, because \notherwise she couldn't live there. Even with Tomas, she was obliged to behave lovingly \nbecause she needed him. We can never est ablish with certainty what part of our \nrelations with others is the result of our em otions—love, antipathy, charity, or malice—\nand what part is predetermined by the constant power play among individuals. \nTrue human goodness, in all its purity and freedom , can come to the fore only when its \nrecipient has no power. Mankind's true moral test, its fundamental test (which lies \ndeeply buried from view), consists of its a ttitude towards those who are at its mercy: \nanimals. And in this respect mankind has suffered a fundamental debacle, a debacle so \nfundamental that all others stem from it. \nOne of the heifers had made friends with Tereza. The heifer would stop and stare at her \nwith her big brown eyes. Tereza knew her.  She called her Marketa. She would have \nbeen happy to give all her heifers names, but  she was unable to. There were too many \nof them. Not so long before, forty years or so, all the cows in the village had names. \n(And if having a name is a si gn of having a soul, I can say that they had souls despite \nDescartes.) But then the villages were turned into a large collective factory, and the \ncows began spending all their lives in the five  square feet set aside for them in their \ncow sheds. From that time on, t hey have had no names and become mere machinae \nanimatae. The world has proved Descartes correct. \nTereza keeps appearing before my eyes. I see her sitting on the stump petting \nKarenin's head and ruminating on mankind' s debacles. Another image also comes to \nmind: Nietzsche leaving his hotel in Turin.  Seeing a horse and a coachman beating it\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 151\nwith a whip, Nietzsche went up to the horse and, before the coachman's very eyes, put \nhis arms around the horse's neck and burst into tears. \nThat took place in 1889, w hen Nietzsche, too, had removed himself from the world of \npeople. In other words, it wa s at the time when his mental illness had just erupted. But \nfor that very reason I feel his gesture has broad implications: \nNietzsche was trying to apologiz e to the horse for Descartes. His lunacy (that is, his \nfinal break with mankind) began at the very moment he burst into tears over the horse. \nAnd that is the Nietzsche I love, just as I lo ve Tereza with the mortally ill dog resting his \nhead in her lap. I see them one next to the other: both stepping down from the road \nalong which mankind, the master and proprietor of nature, marches onward. \nKarenin gave birth to two rolls and a bee. He stared, amazed, at his own progeny. The \nrolls were utterly serene, but  the bee staggered about as if  drugged, then flew up and \naway. \nOr so it happened in Tereza's dream. She told  it to Tomas the minute he woke up, and \nthey both found a certain consolation in i t. It transformed Karenin's illness into a \npregnancy and the drama of givi ng birth into something both laughable and touching: \ntwo rolls and a bee. \nShe again fell prey to illogica l hopes. She got out of bed and put on her clothes. Here, \ntoo, her day began with a trip to the shop for milk, bread, rolls. But when she called \nKarenin for his walk that morning, he barely ra ised his head. It was the first time that he \nhad refused to take part in the ritual he himself had forced upon them. \nShe went off without him. Where's Karenin? asked the wom an behind the counter, who \nhad Karenin's roll ready as usual. Tereza carried it home herself in her bag, She pulled \nit out and showed it to him while still in the doorway. She wanted him to come and fetch \nit. But he just lay there motionless. \nTomas saw how unhappy Tereza was. He put the roll in  his mouth and dropped down \non all fours opposite Karenin. Then he slowly crawled up to him. \nKarenin followed him with his eyes, which seemed to show a glimmer of interest, but he \ndid not pick himself up. Tomas brought his face right up to his muzzle. Without moving \nhis body, the dog took the end of the roll sti cking out of Tomas's mouth into his own. \nThen Tomas let go of his end so that Karenin could eat it all. \nStill on all fours, Tomas retreated a little, ar ched his back, and started yelping, making \nbelieve he wanted to fight over the roll. After a short while, the dog responded with \nsome yelps of his own. At la st! What they were hoping for! Karenin feels like playing! \nKarenin hasn't lost the will to live! \nThose yelps were Karenin's smile, and they w anted it to last as long as possible. So \nTomas crawled back to him and tore off the end of the roll sticking out of Karenin's \nmouth. Their faces were so close that Tomas could smell the dog's breath, feel the long\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 152\nhairs on Karenin's muzzle tickling him. Th e dog gave out another yelp and his mouth \ntwitched; now they each had half a roll between their teet h. Then Karenin made an old \ntactical error: he dropped his hal f in the hope of seizing the half in his master's mouth, \nforgetting, as always, that Tomas was not a dog and had hands. Without  letting his half \nof the roll out of his mouth, Tomas picked up the other half from the floor. \nTomas! Tereza cried. You're not going to take his roll away from him, are you?  \nTomas laid both halves on the floor in front  of Karenin, who quickly gulped down the \nfirst and held the second in his mouth for an ostentatiously long time, flaunting his \nvictory over the two of them. \nStanding there watching him, they thought once more that he was smiling and that as \nlong as he kept smiling he had a motive to keep living despite his death sentence. \nThe next day his condition actually appeared to have improved. They had lunch. It was \nthe time of day when they normally took him out for a walk. His habit was to start \nrunning back and forth between t hem restlessly. On that day, however, Tereza picked \nup the leash and collar only to be stared at dully. They tried to look cheerful (for and \nabout him) and pep him up a bit, and after a long wait he t ook pity on them, tottered \nover on his three legs, and let her put on the collar. \nI know you hate the camera, Tereza, said Tomas, but take it along today, will you?  \nTereza went and opened the cupboard to rummage for the long-abandoned, long-\nforgotten camera. One day we'll be glad to have the pictures, Tomas went on. Karenin \nhas been an important part of our life.  \nWhat do you mean, 'has been'? said Tereza as if she had been bitt en by a snake. The \ncamera lay directly in front of her on the cupboard floor, but she would not bend to pick \nit up. I won't take it along. I refuse to thin k about losing Karenin. And you refer to him in \nthe past tense! I'm sorry, said Tomas. \nThat's all right, said Tereza mildly. I catch myself thinking about him in the past tense all \nthe time. I keep having to push it out of my mind. That's why I won't take the camera.  \nThey walked along in silence. Silence was the only way of not thinking about Karenin in \nthe past tense. They did not let him out of their sight; they were with him constantly, \nwaiting for him to smile. But he did not smile; he merely  walked with them, limping \nalong on his three legs. \nHe's just doing it for us, said Tereza. He didn't want to go for a walk. He's just doing it to \nmake us happy.  \nIt was sad, what she said, yet without realizing it they were happy. They were happy not \nin spite of their sadness but thanks to it. They were holding hands and both had the \nsame image in their eyes: a limping dog who represented ten years of their lives.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 153\nThey walked a bit farther. Then, to thei r great disappointment, Karenin stopped and \nturned. They had to go back. \nPerhaps that day or perhaps the next Tereza walked in  on Tomas reading a letter. \nHearing the door open, he slipped it in among some other papers, but she saw him do \nit. On her way out of the room she also no ticed him stuffing the letter into his pocket. \nBut he forgot about the envelope. As soon as  she was alone in the house, she studied \nit carefully. The address was written in an un familiar hand, but it was very neat and she \nguessed it to be a woman's. \nWhen he came back later, she asked him nonchalantly whether the mail had come. \nNo, said Tomas, and filled Tereza with despair, a despair all the worse for her having \ngrown unaccustomed to it. No, she did not believe he had a secret mistress in the \nvillage. That was all but impossible. She knew  what he did with ev ery spare minute. He \nmust have kept up with a woman in Prague who meant so much to him that he thought \nof her even if she could no longer leave the smell of her groin in his hair. Tereza did not \nbelieve that Tomas meant to leave her for the woman, but the happiness of their two \nyears in the country now seemed besmirched by lies. \nAn old thought came back to her: Her home was Karenin, not Tomas. Who would wind \nthe clock of their days when he was gone? \nTransported mentally into the future, a future without Karenin, Tereza felt abandoned. \nKarenin was lying in a corner whimpering. Tereza went out into the garden. She looked \ndown at a patch of grass be tween two apple trees and im agined burying Karenin there. \nShe dug her heel into the earth and traced a rectangle in the grass. That was where his \ngrave would be. \nWhat are you doing? Tomas asked, surpri sing her just as she had surprised him \nreading the letter a few hours earlier. \nShe gave no answer. He noticed her hands tremb ling for the first time in many months. \nHe grabbed hold of them. She pulled away from him. \nIs that a grave for Karenin?  \nShe did not answer. \nHer silence grated on him. He exploded. Firs t you blame me for thinking of him in the \npast tense, and then what do you do? You go and make the funeral arrangements! She \nturned her back on him. \nTomas retreated into his room, slamming the door behind him. \nTereza went in and opened it. Instead of thinking about yourself all the time, you might \nat least have some consideration for him, she said. He was asleep until you woke him. \nNow he'll start whimpering again.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 154\nShe knew she was being unfair (the dog was not asleep); she knew she was acting like \nthe most vulgar of women, the kind that is out to cause pain and knows how. \nTomas tiptoed into the room where Karenin was lying, but  she would not leave him \nalone with the dog. They both leaned over him, each from his own side. Not that there \nwas a hint of reconciliation in  the move. Quite the contrary . Each of them was alone. \nTereza with her dog, Tomas with his. \nIt is thus divided, each alone, that, sad to  say, they remained with him until his last \nhour. \nWhy was the word idyll so important for Tereza? \nRaised as we are on the mythology of the Ol d Testament, we might say that an idyll is \nan image that has remained with us like a memo ry of Paradise: life in Paradise was not \nlike following a straight line to the unknown; it was not an adventure. It moved in a circle \namong known objects. Its monotony bred happiness, not boredom. \nAs long as people lived in t he country, in nature, surrounded by domestic animals, in \nthe bosom of regularly recurring seasons, they retained at least a glimmer of that \nparadisiac idyll. That is why Tereza, when she met the chai rman of the collective farm \nat the spa, conjured up an image of the countryside (a countryside she had never lived \nin or known) that she f ound enchanting. It was her way of looking back, back to \nParadise. \nAdam, leaning over a well, did not yet rea lize that what he saw was himself. He would \nnot have understood Tereza when she stood before the mirror as a young girl and tried \nto see her soul through her body. Adam was like Karenin. Tereza made a game of \ngetting him to look at himself in the mirror, but he never recognized his image, gazed at \nit vacantly, with incredible indifference. \nComparing Adam and Karenin leads me to the thought that  in Paradise man was not \nyet man. Or to be more precise, man had not yet been cast out on man's path. Now we \nare longtime outcasts, Hying through the empt iness of time in a straight line. Yet \nsomewhere deep down a thin thread still ties us  to that far-off misty Paradise, where \nAdam leans over a well and, unlike Narcissus, never even suspects that the pale yellow \nblotch appearing in it is he himself. The longi ng for Paradise is man's longing not to be \nman. \nWhenever, as a child, she came across her mother's sanitary napkins soiled with \nmenstrual blood, she felt disgusted, and hated her mother for lacking the shame to hide \nthem. But Karenin, who was after all a fe male, had his periods, too. They came once \nevery six months and lasted a fortnight. To keep him from soiling their flat, Tereza \nwould put a wad of absorbent cotton between his legs and pull a pair of old panties over \nit, skillfully tying them to his body with a long ribbon. S he would go on laughing at the \noutfit for the entire two weeks of each period. \nWhy is it that a dog's menstruation made  her lighthearted and gay, while her own \nmenstruation made her squeamish? The answer seems simple to me: dogs were never\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 155\nexpelled from Paradise. Karenin knew not hing about the duality of body and soul and \nhad no concept of disgust. That is why Tereza felt so free and eas y with him. (And that \nis why it is so dangerous to turn an animal into a machina animata, a  cow into an \nautomaton for the production of milk. By so doing, man cuts  the thread binding him to \nParadise and has nothing left to  hold or comfort him on his flight through the emptiness \nof time.) \nFrom this jumble of ideas came a sacrilegi ous thought that Tereza could not shake off: \nthe love that tied her to Karenin was be tter than the love bet ween her and Tomas. \nBetter, not bigger. Tereza did not wish to fault either Tomas or herself; she did not wish \nto claim that they could love each other more. Her feeling was rather that, given the \nnature of the human couple, the love of man and woman is a priori inferior to that which \ncan exist (at least in the best instances) in the love between man and dog, that oddity of \nhuman history probably unplanned by the Creator. \nIt is a completely selfless love: Tereza did not want anything of Karenin; she did not \never ask him to love her back. Nor had she ever asked herself the questions that \nplague human couples: Does he love me? Does he love anyone more than me? Does \nhe love me more than I love him? Perhaps all the questions we ask of love, to measure, \ntest, probe, and save it, have the additional effect of cutting it short. Perhaps the reason \nwe are unable to love is that we yearn to be loved, that is, we demand something (love) \nfrom our partner instead of delivering ourselves up to him demand-free and asking for \nnothing but his company. \nAnd something else: Tereza accepted Karenin for what he was; she did not try to make \nhim over in her image; she agreed from the outset with his dog's life, did not wish to \ndeprive him of it, did not envy him his secret  intrigues. The reason she trained him was \nnot to transform him (as a husband tries to  reform his wife and a wife her husband), but \nto provide him with the elementary languag e that enabled them to communicate and \nlive together. \nThen too: No one forced her to  love Karenin; love for dogs  is voluntary. (Tereza was \nagain reminded of her mother, and regrett ed everything that had happened between \nthem. If her mother had been one of the anonymous women in the village, she might \nwell have found her easygoing coarseness agreeable. Oh, if only her mother had been \na stranger! From childhood on, Tereza h ad been ashamed of the way her mother \noccupied the features of her face and confis cated her I . What made it even worse was \nthat the age-old imperative Lov e your father and mother! fo rced her to agree with that \noccupation, to call the aggression love! It was not her mother's fault that Tereza broke \nwith her. Tereza broke with her not because she was the mother she was but because \nshe was a mother.) \nBut most of all: No one can give anyone else the gift of the idyll; only an animal can do \nso, because only animals were not expelled fr om Paradise. The love between dog and \nman is idyllic. It knows no conflicts, no hai r-raising scenes; it kn ows no development. \nKarenin surrounded Tereza and Tomas with a life based on repetition, and he expected \nthe same from them.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 156\nIf Karenin had been a person inst ead of a dog, he would surely  have long since said to \nTereza, Look, I'm sick and tired of carrying that roll in my mouth every day. Can't you \ncome up with something different? And therei n lies the whole of man's plight. Human \ntime does not turn in a circle; it runs ahead in a straight line. That is why man cannot be \nhappy: happiness is the longing for repetition. \nYes, happiness is the longing for repetition, Tereza said to herself. \nWhen the chairman of the collective farm took his Mefisto out for a walk after work and \nmet Tereza, he never failed to say, Why did he come into my life so late, Tereza? We \ncould have gone skirt chasing, he and I! What woman could resist these two little pigs? \nat which point the pig was trained to gr unt and snort. Tereza laughed each time, even \nthough she knew beforehand exac tly what he would say. The joke did not lose its \ncharm, through repetition. On the contrary. In an idyllic setting, even humor is subject to \nthe sweet law of repetition. \nDogs do not have many adv antages over people, but one of them is extremely \nimportant: euthanasia is not forb idden by law in their case; animals have the right to a \nmerciful death. Karenin walked on three legs and spent more and more of his time lying \nin a corner. And whimpering. Both husband and wife agreed that they had no business \nletting him suffer needlessly. But agree as they might in principle, they still had to face \nthe anguish of determining the time when his suffering was in fact needless, the point at \nwhich life was no longer worth living. \nIf only Tomas hadn't been a doctor! Then they would have been able to hide behind a \nthird party. They would have been able to go back to the vet and ask him to put the dog \nto sleep with an injection. \nAssuming the role of Death is a terrifying th ing. Tomas insisted that he would not give \nthe injection himself; he would have the vet come and do it. But then he realized that he \ncould grant Karenin a privilege forbidden to humans: Death would come for him in the \nguise of his loved ones. \nKarenin had whimpered a ll night. After feeling his leg in the morning, Tomas said to \nTereza, There's no point in waiting.  \nIn a few minutes they would both have to go to  work. Tereza went in to see Karenin. \nUntil then, he had lain in his corner comp letely apathetic (not  even acknowledging \nTomas when he felt his l eg), but when he heard the door open and sa w Tereza come \nin, he raised his head and looked at her. \nShe could not stand his stare; it almost frightened her. He did not look that way at \nTomas, only at her. But never with such int ensity. It was not a desperate look, or even \nsad. No, it was a look of awful, unbearable trust. The look was an eager question. All \nhis life Karenin had waited for answers from  Tereza, and he was letting her know (with \nmore urgency than usual, however) that he was st ill ready to learn t he truth from her. \n(Everything that came from Tereza was the truth. Even when she gave commands like \nSit! or Lie down! he took them as truths to identify with, to give his life meaning.)\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 157\nHis look of awful trust did not last long;  he soon laid his head ba ck down on his paws. \nTereza knew that no one ever again would look at her like that. \nThey had never fed him sweets, but recent ly she had bought him a few chocolate bars. \nShe took them out of the foil, broke them into pieces, and made a circle of them around \nhim. Then she brought over a bowl of water to make sure  that he had everything he \nneeded for the several hours he would spend at home alone. The look he had given her \njust then seemed to have tired him out. Ev en surrounded by chocolate, he did not raise \nhis head. \nShe lay down on the floor next  to him and hugged him. With a slow and labored turn of \nthe head, he sniffed her and gave her a lick or two. She closed her eyes while the \nlicking went on, as if she want ed to remember it forever. She held out the other cheek \nto be licked. \nThen she had to go and take care  of her heifers. She did not  return until just before \nlunch. Tomas had not come home yet. Karenin was still lying on the floor surrounded by \nthe chocolate, and did not even lift his hea d when he heard her come in. His bad leg \nwas swollen now, and the tumor had burst in another place. She noticed some light red \n(not blood-like,) drops forming beneath his fur. \nAgain she lay down next to  him on the floor. She st retched one arm across his body \nand closed her eyes. Then she heard som eone banging on the door. Doctor! Doctor! \nThe pig is here! The pig and his master! She lacked the strength to talk to anyone, and \ndid not move, did not open her eyes. Doctor! Doctor! The pigs have come! Then \nsilence. \nTomas did not get back for another half hour. He went straight to the kitchen and \nprepared the injection without a word. When he entered the room, Tereza was on her \nfeet and Karenin was picking himself up. As soon as he saw Tomas, he gave him a \nweak wag of the tail. \nLook, said Tereza, he's still smiling. She said it beseechingly, trying to win a short \nreprieve, but did not push for it. \nSlowly she spread a sheet out over the couch. It was a white sheet with a pattern of tiny \nviolets. She had everything carefully laid out and thought out, having imagined \nKarenin's death many days in advance. (Oh, how horrible that we actually dream ahead \nto the death of those we love!) \nHe no longer had the strength to jump up on the couch. They picked him up in their \narms together. Tereza laid him on his si de, and Tomas examined one of his good legs. \nHe was looking for a more or less prominent vein. Then he cut away the fur with a pair \nof scissors. \nTereza knelt by the couch and held Karenin's head close to her own. \nTomas asked her to squeeze the leg because he was having trouble sticking the needle \nin. She did as she was told, but did not move  her face from his head. She kept talking\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 158\ngently to Karenin, and he thought only of her. He was not afraid. He licked her face two \nmore times. And Tereza kept whispering,  Don't be scared, don't be scared, you won't \nfeel any pain there, you'll dream of squirrels and rabbits, you'll have cows there, and \nMefisto will be there, don't be scared ...  \nTomas jabbed the needle into the vein and pushed the plunger. Karenin's leg jerked; \nhis breath quickened for a few seconds, then stopped. Tereza remained on the floor by \nthe couch and buried her face in his head. \nThen they both had to go back to  work and leave t he dog laid out on the couch, on the \nwhite sheet with tiny violets. \nThey came back towards evening. Tomas went into the garden. He found the lines of \nthe rectangle that Tereza had drawn with her heel between the two apple trees. Then \nhe started digging. He kept precisely to her  specifications. He wanted everything to be \njust as Tereza wished. \nShe stayed in the house with Karenin. She was afraid of burying him alive. She put her \near to his mouth and thought she heard a w eak breathing sound. She stepped back \nand seemed to see his breast moving slightly. \n(No, the breath she h eard was her own, and because it  set her own body ever so \nslightly in motion, she had the impression the dog was moving.) \nShe found a mirror in her bag and held it to hi s mouth. The mirror was so smudged she \nthought she saw drops on it, drops caused by his breath. \nTomas! He's alive! she cried, when Tomas came in from the garden in his muddy boots. \nTomas bent over him and shook his head. T hey each took an end of the sheet he was \nlying on, Tereza the lower end, Tomas the upper. Then they lifted him up and carried \nhim out to the garden. \nThe sheet felt wet to Tereza's hands. He puddled his way into our lives and now he's \npuddling his way out, she thought, and she was gl ad to feel the moisture on her hands, \nhis final greeting. \nThey carried him to the apple trees and se t him down. She leaned over the pit and \narranged the sheet so that it covered him entirely. It was unbearable to think of the \nearth they would soon be throwing over him, raining down on his naked body. \nThen she went into the house and came back with his collar, his leash, and a handful of \nthe chocolate that had lain untouched on the floor since morn ing. She threw it all in \nafter him. \nNext to the pit was a pile of freshly dug earth. Tomas picked up the shovel. \nJust then Tereza recalled her  dream: Karenin giving birth to two rolls and a bee. \nSuddenly the words sounded like an epitaph. She pictured a monument standing there,\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 159\nbetween the apple trees, with the inscription Here lies Karenin. He gave birth to two \nrolls and a bee. \nIt was twilight in the garden,  the time between day and evening. There was a pale \nmoon in the sky, a forgotten lamp in the room of the dead. \nTheir boots were caked with dirt by the time they took the shovel and spade back to the \nrecess where their tools stood all in a row: rakes, watering cans, hoes. \nHe was sitting at the desk where he usually r ead his books. At times like these Tereza \nwould come up to him from behind, lean over, and press her cheek to his. On that day, \nhowever, she gave a start. Tomas was not reading a book; he had a letter in front of \nhim, and even though it consisted of no more  than five typed lines, Tomas was staring \nat it long and hard. \nWhat is it? Tereza asked, full of sudden anguish. \nWithout turning his head, Tomas picked up the letter and handed it to her. It said that \nhe was obliged to report that day to the airfield of the neighboring town. \nWhen at last he turned to her, Tereza read her own new-felt horror in his eyes. \nI'll go with you, she said. \nHe shook his head. I'm the one they want to see.  \nNo, I'm going with you, she repeated. \nThey took Tomas's pickup. They were at the airfield in no time. It was foggy. They could \nmake out only the vaguest outlines  of the few airplanes on th e field. They went from \none to the next, but the doors were all closed.  No admittance. At last they found one \nthat was open, with a set of movable stairs l eading up to it. They climbed the stairs and \nwere greeted by a steward at the door. It wa s a small airplane—one that sat barely \nthirty passengers—and completely empty. They walked down the aisle between the \nseats, holding on to each other and not pay ing much attention to their surroundings. \nThey took two adjoining seats, and Tereza laid her head on Tomas's shoulder. The first \nwave of horror had passed and been replaced by sadness. \nHorror is a shock, a time of utter blindness. Horror lacks every hint of beauty. All we can \nsee is the piercing light of  an unknown event awaiting us. Sadness, on the other hand, \nassumes we are in the know. Tomas and Te reza knew what was awaiting them. The \nlight of horror thus lost its harshness, and th e world was bathed in a gentle, bluish light \nthat actually beautified it. \nWhile reading the letter, Tereza did not feel  any love for Tomas; she simply realized \nthat she could not now leave him for an inst ant: the feeling of ho rror overwhelmed all \nother emotions and instincts. Now that she was leaning against him (as the plane sailed \nthrough the storm clouds), her fear subsided and she became aware of her love, a love \nthat she knew had no limit or bounds.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 160\nAt last the airplane landed.  They stood up and went to the door, which the steward \nopened for them. Still holding each other around t he waist, they stood at the top of the \nstairs. Down below they saw three men with hoods over their heads and rifles in their \nhands. There was no point in stalling, becau se there was no escape. They descended \nslowly, and when their feet reached the ground of the airfield, one of the men raised his \nrifle and aimed it at them. Although no shot rang out, Tereza felt Tomas—who a second \nbefore had been leaning against her, his arm around her waist—crumple to the ground. \nShe tried pressing him to her but could not hold him up, and he fell against the cement \nrunway. She leaned over him, about to fling herself on him, cover him with her body, \nwhen suddenly she noticed something strange:  his body was quickly shrinking before \nher eyes. She was so shocked that she fr oze and stood stock still. The more Tomas's \nbody shrank, the less it resembled him, until it turned into a ti ny little object that started \nmoving, running, dashing across the airfield. \nThe man who had shot him took off his ma sk and gave Tereza a pleasant smile. Then \nhe turned and set off after the little object, whic h was darting here and there as if trying \ndesperately to dodge someone and find shelter. The chase went on for a while, until \nsuddenly the man hurled himself to the ground. The chase was over. \nThe man stood up and went back to Tereza, carrying the object in his hand. It was \nquaking with fear. It was a rabbit. He handed it  to Tereza. At that instant her fear and \nsadness subsided and she was happy to be holding an animal in her arms, happy that \nthe animal was hers and she could press it to her body. She burst into tears of joy. She \nwept, wept until blinded by her tears, and took the rabbit hom e with the feeling that she \nwas nearly at her goal, the place where she wanted to be and would never forsake. \nWandering the streets of Pr ague, she had no trouble find ing her house, the house \nwhere she had lived with Mama  and Papa as a small girl. But Mama and Papa were \ngone. She was greeted by two old people s he had never seen before, but whom she \nknew to be her great-gr andfather and great-grandmother. They both had faces as \nwrinkled as the bark of a tree, and Tere za was happy she woul d be living with them. \nBut for now, she wanted to be alone with her  animal. She immediately found the room \nshe had been given at the age of five, when her parents decided she deserved her own \nliving space. \nIt had a bed, a table, and a chair. The table had a lamp on it, a lamp that had never \nstopped burning in anticipation of her return, and on the lamp perched a butterfly with \ntwo large eyes painted on its widespread wings . Tereza knew she was at her goal. She \nlay down on the bed and pressed the rabbit to her face. \nHe was sitting at the desk where he us ually read his books, an open envelope with a \nletter in it lying in front of him. From time to time I get letters I haven't told you about, he \nsaid to Tereza. They're from my son. I've  tried to keep his life and mine completely \nseparate, and look how fate is getting even  with me. A few years ago he was expelled \nfrom the university. Now he dr ives a tractor in a village. Our lives may be separate, but \nthey run in the same direction, like parallel lines.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 161\nWhy didn't you ever tell me about the letters ? Tereza asked, with a feeling of great \nrelief. \nI don't know. It was too unpleasant, I suppos e. Does he write o ften? Now and then. \nWhat about? Himself. And is it interesting?  \nYes, it is. You remember that his mother was an ardent Communist. Well, he broke with \nher long ago. Then he took up with peopl e who had trouble like ours, and got involved \nin political activities with them. Some of them are in pr ison now. But he's broken with \nthem, too. In his letters he calls them 'eternal revolutionaries.'  \nDoes that mean he's made his peace with the regime? No, not in the least. He believes \nin God and thinks that that's the key. He says we should al l live our daily lives accord-\ning to the dictates of religion and pay no heed to  the regime, completely ignore it. If we \nbelieve in God, he claims, we can take any situation and, by means of our own \nbehavior, transform it into what he calls 'the kingdom of God on earth.' He tells me that \nthe Church is the only volu ntary association in ourcountr y which eludes the control of \nthe state. I wonder wh ether he's joined the Church bec ause it helps him to oppose the \nregime or because he really believes in God. Why don't you ask him?  \nI used to admire believers, Tomas continued. I thought they had an odd transcendental \nway of perceiving things whic h was closed to me. Like clairvoyants, you might say. But \nmy son's experience proves t hat faith is actually quite a simple matter. He was down \nand out, the Catholics took him in, and befor e he knew it, he had faith. So it was \ngratitude that decided the issue, most likel y. Human decisions are terribly simple. \nHaven't you ever answered his letters? He never gives a return address, he said, \nthough the postmark indicates the name of the district. I could just send a letter to the \nlocal collective farm.  \nTereza was ashamed of hav ing been suspicious of Tomas, and hoped to expiate her \nguilt with a rush of benevolence towards hi s son. Then why not drop him a line, invite \nhim to come and see us?  \nHe looks like me, said Tomas. When he talks, his upper lip curls just like mine. The \nthought of watching my own lips go on about the kingdom of God—it seems too \nstrange. Tereza burst out laughing. Tomas laughed with her. \nDon't be such a child, Tomas! said Tereza. It' s ancient history, after all, you and your \nfirst wife. What's it to him? What's he got  to do with it? Why hurt the boy just because \nyou had bad taste when you were young?  \nFrankly, I have stage fright at  the thought of meeting him.  That's the main reason I \nhaven't done anything about it. I don't know what's made me so headstrong and kept \nme from seeing him. Sometimes you make  up your mind about something without \nknowing why, and your decision persists by t he power of inertia. Every year it gets \nharder to change.  \nInvite him, she said.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 162\nThat afternoon she was on her way back from  the cow sheds when she heard voices \nfrom the road. Coming closer, she saw Tomas's pickup. Tomas was bent over, \nchanging a tire, while some of the men sto od about looking on and waiting for him to \nfinish. \nShe could not tear her eyes away from him: he looked like an old man. His hair had \ngone gray, and his lack of coordination was not that of a surgeon tur ned driver but of a \nman no longer young. \nShe recalled a recent talk with  the chairman of the collective  farm. He had told her that \nTomas's pickup was in miserable condition. He  said it as a joke, not a complaint, but \nshe could tell he was concerned. Tomas knows the insides of the body better than the \ninsides of an engine, he said with a laugh. He then confessed that he had made several \nvisits to the authorities to request permission for Tomas to resume his medical practice, \nif only locally. He had learned that the police would never grant it. \nShe had stepped behind a tree trunk so that none of the men by the pickup could see \nher. Standing there observing him,  she suffered a bout of self -recrimination: It was her \nfault that he had come back to Prague from Zurich, her fault that he had left Prague, \nand even here she could not leave him in peace, torturing him with her secret \nsuspicions while Karenin lay dying. \nShe had always secretly reproached him for not loving her enough. Her own love she \nconsidered above reproach, while his seemed mere condescension. \nNow she saw that she had been unfair: If she had really loved Tomas with a great love, \nshe would have stuck it out with him abr oad! Tomas had been happy there; a new life \nwas opening for him! And she had left him! True, at th e time she had convinced herself \nshe was being magnanimous, giving him his freedom. But hadn't her magnanimity been \nmerely an excuse? She knew all along that he would come  home to her! She had \nsummoned him farther and farther down after her like the nymphs who lured \nunsuspecting villagers to the marshes and le ft them there to drown. She had taken \nadvantage of a night of stomach cramps to inveigle him into moving to the country! How \ncunning she could be! She had summoned him to follow her as if wishing to test him \nagain and again, to test his love for her; she had summoned him persistently, and here \nhe was, tired and gray, with stiffened fingers that would never again be capable of \nholding a scalpel. \nNow they were in a place that led nowher e. Where could they go from here? They \nwould never be allowed abroad. They would never find a way back to Prague: no one \nwould give them work. They didn't even have a reason to move to another village. \nGood God, had they had to cove r all that distance just to make her believe he loved \nher? \nAt last Tomas succeeded in ge tting the tire back on. He c limbed in behind the wheel, \nthe men jumped in the back, and the engine roared.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 163\nShe went home and drew a bath. Lying in the hot water, she kept telling herself that she \nhad set a lifetime of her weaknesses against Tomas. We all have a tendency to \nconsider strength the culprit and weakness the innocent victim. But now Tereza \nrealized that in her case the opposite was tr ue! Even her dreams, as  if aware of the \nsingle weakness in a man otherwise strong, made a display of her suffering to him, \nthereby forcing him to retreat. Her weakness was aggressive and kept forcing him to \ncapitulate until eventually he lost his strength and was transformed into the rabbit in her \narms. She could not get that dream out of her mind. \nShe stood up from her bath and went to put on some nice clothes. She wanted to look \nher best to please him, make him happy. \nJust as she buttoned the last but ton, in burst Tomas with t he chairman of the collective \nfarm and an unusually pale young farm worker. \nQuick! shouted Tomas. Something strong to drink! Tereza ran out and came back with \na bottle of slivovitz. She poured some into  a liqueur glass, and the young man downed \nit in one gulp. \nThen they told her what had happened. The man had disl ocated his shoulder and \nstarted bellowing with pain. No one knew what to do, so they called Tomas, who with \none jerk set it back in its socket. \nAfter downing another glass of s livovitz, the man said to To mas, Your wife's looking \nawfully pretty today.  \nYou idiot, said the chairman. Tereza is always pretty.  \nI know she's always pretty, said the young m an, but today she has such pretty clothes \non, too. I've never seen you in that dress. Are you going out somewhere?  \nNo, I'm not. I put it on for Tomas.  \nYou lucky devil! said the chairman, laughing. My old woman wouldn't dream of dressing \nup just for me.  \nSo that's why you go out walking with your  pig instead of your wife, said the young \nman, and he started laughing, too. \nHow is Mefisto, anyway? asked Tomas. I haven't seen him for at least —he thought a \nbit— at least an hour.  \nHe must be missing me, said the chairman. \nSeeing you in that dress makes me want to  dance, the young man said to Tereza. And \nturning to Tomas, he asked, Would you let me dance with her?  \nLet's all go and dance, said Tereza. \nWould you come along? the young man asked Tomas.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 164\nWhere do you plan to go? asked Tomas. \nThe young man named a nearby town where the hotel bar had a dance floor. \nYou come too, said the young man in an imperative tone of voice to the chairman of the \ncollective farm, and because by then he had dow ned a third glass of slivovitz, he \nadded, If Mefisto misses you so much, we'll ta ke him along. Then we'll have both little \npigs to show off. The women will come begging when they get an eyeful of those two \ntogether! And again he laughed and laughed. \nIf you're not ashamed of Mefisto, I'm all yours. And they piled into Tomas's pickup—\nTomas behind the wheel, Tereza next to him, and the two men in the back with the half-\nempty bottle of slivovitz. Not until they had left the village beh ind did the chairman \nrealize that they had forgotten Mefisto. He shouted up to Tomas to turn back. \nNever mind, said the young man. One littl e pig will do the trick. That calmed the \nchairman down. \nIt was growing dark. The road started climbing in hairpin curves. \nWhen they reached the town, they drove stra ight to the hotel. Tereza and Tomas had \nnever been there before. They went downsta irs to the basement, where they found the \nbar, the dance floor, and some tables. A man of about sixty was playing the piano, a \nwoman of the same age the violin. The hits they played were forty years old. There \nwere five or so couples out on the floor. \nNothing here for me, said the young man afte r surveying the situation, and immediately \nasked Tereza to dance. \nThe collective farm chairman sat down at an empty table with Tomas and ordered a \nbottle of wine. \nI can't drink, Tomas reminded him. I'm driving.  \nDon't be silly, he said. We're staying the nigh t. And he went off to the reception desk to \nbook two rooms. \nWhen Tereza came back from the dance floor with the young man, the chairman asked \nher to dance, and finally Tomas had a turn with her, too. \nTomas, she said to him out on the floor, everything bad that's happened in your life is \nmy fault. It's my fault you ended up here, as low as you could possibly go.  \nLow? What are you talking about?  \nIf we had stayed in Zurich, you'd still be a surgeon.  \nAnd you'd be a photographer.\n\f\n\"The Unbearable Lightness Of Being\" By Milan Kundera 165\nThat's a silly comparison to make, said Tere za. Your work meant everything to you; I \ndon't care what I do, I can do anything, I haven't lost a thing; you've lost everything.  \nHaven't you noticed I've been happy here, Tereza? Tomas said. \nSurgery was your mission, she said. \nMissions are stupid, Tereza. I have no mission. No one has. And it's a terrific relief to \nrealize you're free, free of all missions.  \nThere was no doubting that fort hright voice of his. She recalled the scene she had \nwitnessed earlier in the day when he had been repairing the pickup and looked so old. \nShe had reached her goal : she had always w anted him to be old. Again she thought of \nthe rabbit she had pressed to her face in her childhood room. \nWhat does it mean to turn into a rabbit? It means losing all strength.  It means that one \nis no stronger than the other anymore. \nOn they danced to the strains of the pi ano and violin. Tereza leaned her head on \nTomas's shoulder. Just as she had when they flew together in the airplane through the \nstorm clouds. She was experiencing the same odd happiness and odd sadness as \nthen. The sadness meant: we are at the la st station. The hap piness meant: we are \ntogether. The sadness was form, the happiness content. Happiness filled the space of \nsadness. \nThey went back to their table.
