, it will disappear. It comes only when you are unaware, doing something else. You cannot go directly, arrowlike. Love is not a target. It is very subtle. If you go direct, it will hide. If you do something direct, you will miss. Cooling Passions If love goes deeper, husbands and wives eventually become brothers and sisters. If love goes deeper, the sun energy becomes moon energy. The heat is gone, it is very cool. And when love goes deeper, a misunderstanding can also happen because we have become accustomed to that fever, passion, that excitement, and now it looks all foolish. It is foolish! Now if you make love, it looks silly; if you don’t, you feel as if something is missing because of the old habit. So, you will have to understand this coolness that is coming. And of course when you start feeling as one, a fear arises. A fear about what is happening because if the two of you become too much one person, you will start forgetting the other. The other can be remembered only as “the other.” Psychologists say that when a child starts learning and the word he first utters is “daddy,” it hurts the mother because she has been taking care of the child and she carried the child for nine months. She is with him all the time, but when he says “daddy,” she is no longer there. That is a real fear that we have to go through in our life—that when we merge completely with another person, we may lose ourselves. This interim period will be a little hard, but don’t think of the past. It is gone and it is gone forever; even if you try, you cannot bring it back.
