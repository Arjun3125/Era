Joy is a positive phenomenon. Not to be miserable is just a kind of forgetfulness. The misery is waiting back home for you, and whenever you come back it will be there. When excitement disappears, one starts thinking, "Now what is the point of this love?" What people call "love" dies with excitement, and that is a calamity. In fact, love had never been born. It was just a love of excitement; it was not real love. It was just an effort to move away from yourself. It was a search for sensation. You rightly use the word "fun" in your question; it was fun, but it was not intimacy. When excitement disappears and you just start feeling loving, love can grow; now the feverish days are over. This is the true beginning of love. But by that time your mind thinks that all is over, finished: "Search for another woman, search for another man. Now what is the point in continuing? There is no more fun!" If you go on loving now, love will take on a depth, it will become intimacy. A quality of grace will arise in it. It will have a subtlety now, it will not be superficial. It will not be fun, it will be meditation, it will be prayerfulness. It will help you to know yourself. The other will become a mirror, and through her you will be able to know yourself. Now is the time, the right time for love to grow because all the energy that was being channeled into excitement will not be wasted; it will be poured into the very roots of love, and the tree will be able to have great foliage. If you can go on growing in this intimacy, which is no longer excitement, then joy will arise: first excitement, then love, then joy. Joy is the ultimate product, the fulfillment. Excitement is just a beginning, a trigger; it is not the end. And those who finish things at excitement will never know what love is, will never know the mystery of love, will never come to know the joy of love. They will know sensations, excitement, passionate fever, but not love.
