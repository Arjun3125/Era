This tension between pain and pleasure makes you capable of creating great music; music exists only in this tension. Destroy the polarity and you will be dull, you will be stale, you will be dusty. You won't have any meaning and you will never know what splendor is. You will have missed life. One who wants to know life and live life has to accept and embrace death. They come together, they are two aspects of a single phenomenon. That's why growth is painful. You have to go into all those pains that you have been avoiding. It hurts. You have to go through all those wounds that somehow you have managed not to look at. But the deeper you go into pain, the deeper is your capacity to go into pleasure. If you can go into pain to the uttermost limit, you will be able to touch heaven. I have heard that a seeker came to a Zen master and asked, "How shall we avoid heat and cold?" Metaphorically, he is asking, "How should we avoid pleasure and pain?" That is the Zen way of talking about pleasure and pain, "heat and cold." "How shall we avoid heat and cold?" The master answered, "Be hot, be cold." To be free of pain the pain has to be accepted, inevitably and naturally. Pain is pain—a simple, painful fact. Suffering becomes poisonous only when you avoid it. When you are absent, then it enters into your system. Only when you are present can a pain become part of your being. And if you can go on taking note of your pains you will not be accumulating them. Growth means you are being born every day. Birth does not end the day you were born; on that day, it simply starts, and it is only a beginning.
