Sometimes it takes a long time for boundaries to disappear, as if the other does not exist at all, and the whole universe exists only for you. In that moment of aloneness, one realizes what infinity is. But then, if you live in it too much, by degrees the infinity bores you. There is purity and silence, but there is no ecstasy in it. Ecstasy always comes through the other. One then starts feeling hungry for love, and wants to escape from this aloneness, this vast expanse of space. This is the basic polarity of life, love and meditation. People who try to live through love and relationships alone become very limited. They lose infinity and purity, and they become superficial. Always living in relationships means always living on the boundary where you can meet the other. So you are always standing at the gate, and you can never move into your palace, because only at the gate is the meeting-point where the other passes by. People who only live in love become superficial. Their life loses depth. And people who live only in meditation will become very deep, but their life loses color, loses the ecstatic dance, the orgasmic quality of being. Real humanity, the humanity of the future, will live with both polarities together, and to share that understanding is my whole effort. One should be free to move from one to another, with neither polarity becoming a confinement. You should not be afraid of the marketplace, nor too afraid of the monastery.
