Is polygamy the way for man? Women made the rules of monogamy by creating prostitutes. In the past it was thought natural for men to visit prostitutes, but in reality both partners are polygamous. The entire existence is polygamous; monogamy is boring. However, beauty can become tiring, and the same geography or topography can also be monotonous. How long do you have to see the same face? So it happens that years pass and the husband has not looked attentively at his wife for a single moment. In the new world, there should be no marriage, only lovers. If both are pleased to be together they can be together; if they feel they have been together too long, a little change will be good. There is no question of sadness or anger, just deep acceptance of nature. And if you have loved a man or woman, you will want to give the other person as much freedom as possible. If love cannot give freedom, then it is not love.
