Love sometimes arises and brings with it some misery. Each time there is a conflict or struggle, a fight or jealousy, possessiveness comes into play. You have started taking an intellectual standpoint: "My love stinks, so why do I cling to the smell?" Because it is not yet really an existential experience for you. And it is your own smell! One becomes accustomed to one's own smell. That's why when people are alone they don't experience that smell, they only experience it when they are together with somebody else. When you are in love then you start showing your real face. Love is a mirror. The other starts functioning as a mirror. Every relationship becomes a mirror. Alone, you don't experience your own smell, you can't; one becomes immune to it. You have lived with it so long, how can you smell it? It is only with the other that you start feeling that he stinks and he starts feeling that you stink. And the fight starts. That is the story of all the couples all over the world. "Where are you going with that goat, Juan?" asked the policeman. "I'm taking him home to keep as a pet!" replied Juan. "But what about the smell?" "So what? He ain't gonna mind the smell!" Your own smell is not disturbing to you. In fact, if it suddenly disappears you will feel a little jolted, you will feel a little uprooted. You will not feel like your natural self; you will feel something has gone wrong.
