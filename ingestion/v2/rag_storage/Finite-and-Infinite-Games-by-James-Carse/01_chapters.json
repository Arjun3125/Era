    "raw_text": "ONE \nTHERE ARE AT \nLEAST Two \nKINDS Of \nGAMES\n\f\n\n\f\n1 \nTHERE ARE at least two kinds of games. One could be called \nfinite, the other infinite. \nA finite game is played for the purpose of winning, an \ninfinite game for the purpose of continuing the play. \n2 \nIf a finite game is to be won by someone it must come \nto a definitive end . It will come to an end when someone \nhas won. \nWe know that someone has won the game when all the \nplayers have agreed who among them is the winner . No other \ncondition than the agreement of the players is absolutely re­\nquired in determining who has won the game. \nIt may appear that the approval of the spectators, or the \nreferees, is also required in the determination of the winner. \nHowever, it is simply the case that if the players do not agree \non a winner, the game has not come to a decisive conclusion­\nand the players have not satisfied the original purpose of play­\ning. Even if they are carried from the field and forcibly blocked \nfrom further play, they will not consider the game ended. \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES\n\f\nSuppose the players all agree, but the spectators and the \nreferees do not. Unless the players can be persuaded that \ntheir agreement was mistaken, they will not resume the play­\nindeed, they cannot resume the play. We cannot imagine \nplayers returning to the field and truly playing if they are \nconvinced the game is over. \nThere is no finite game unless the players freely choose \nto play it. No one can play who is forced to play. \nIt is an invariable principle of all play, finite and infinite, \nthat whoever plays, plays freely. Whoever must play, cannot \nplay. \n3 \nJust as it is essential for a finite game to have a definitive \nending, it must also have a precise beginning . Therefore, we \ncan speak of finite games as having temporal boundaries­\nto which, of course, all players must agree. But players must \nagree to the establishment of spatial and numerical boundaries \nas well. That is, the game must be played within a marked \narea, and with specified players. \nSpatial boundaries are evident in every finite conOict, from \nthe simplest board and court games to world wars. The oppo­\nnents in World War II agreed not to bomb Heidelberg and \nParis and declared Switzerland outside the boundaries of con­\nOict. When unnecessary and excessive damage is inOicted by \none of the sides in warfare, a question arises as to the legitimacy \nof the victory that side may claim, even whether it has been \na war at all and not simply gratuitous unwarranted violence. \nWhen Sherman burned his way from Atlanta to the sea, he \nso ignored the sense of spatial limitation that for many persons \n4\n\f\nthe war was not legitimately won by the Union Army, and \nhas in fact never been concluded. \nNumerical boundaries take many forms but are always ap­\nplied in finite games. Persons are selected for finite play. It \nis the case that we cannot play if we must play, but it is \nalso the case that we cannot play alone. Thus, in every case, \nwe must find an opponent, and in most cases teammates, \nwho are willing to join in play with us. Not everyone who \nwishes to do so may play for, or against, the New York Yankees. \nNeither may they be electricians or agronomists by individual \nchoice, without the approval of their potential colleagues and \ncompetitors . \nBecause finite players cannot select themselves for play, \nthere is never a time when they cannot be removed from \nthe game, or when the other contestants cannot refuse to \nplay with them . The license never belongs to the licensed, \nnor the commission to the officer. \nWhat is preserved by the constancy of numerical bound­\naries, of course, is the possibility that all contestants can agree \non an eventual winner. Whenever persons may walk on or \noff the field of playas they wish, there is such a confusion \nof participants that none can emerge as aclear victor. Who, \nfor example, won the French Revolution? \n4 \nTo have such boundaries means that the date, place, and \nmembership of each finite game are externally defined. When \nwe say of a particular contest that it began on September 1, \n1939, we are speaking from the perspective of world time; \nthat is, from the perspective of what happened before the \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES\n\f\nbeginning of the conflict and what would happen after its \nconclusion . So also with place and membership . A game is \nplayed in that place, with those persons. \nThe world is elaborately marked by boundaries of contest , \nits people finely classified as to their eligibilities. \n5 \nOnly one person or team can win a finite game, but the \nother contestants may well be ranked at the conclusion of \nplay. \nNot everyone can be a corporation president, although some \nwho have competed for that prize may be vice presidents or \ndistrict managers. \nThere are many games we enter not expecting to win, but \nin which we nonetheless compete for the highest possible \nranking . \n6 \nIn one respect, but only one, an infinite game is identical \nto a finite game : Of infinite players we can also say that if \nthey play they play freely; if they must play, they cannot \nplay. \nOtherwise, infinite and finite play stand in the sharpest \npossible contrast. \nInfinite players cannot say when their game began, nor \ndo they care. They do not care for the reason that their game \nis not bounded by time. Indeed, the only purpose of the game \n6\n\f\nis to prevent it from coming to an end, to keep everyone in \nplay. \nThere are no spatial or numerical boundaries to an infinite \ngame. No world is marked with the barriers of infinite play, \nand there is no question of eligibility since anyone who wishes \nmay play an infinite game. \nWhile finite games are externally defined, infinite games \nare internally defined. The time of an infinite game is not \nworld time, but time created within the play itself. Since \neach play of an infinite game eliminates boundaries , it opens \nto players a new horizon of time . \nFor this reason it is impossible to say how long an infinite \ngame has been played, or even can be played, since duration \ncan be measured only externally to that which endures. It is \nalso impossible to say in which world an infinite game is played, \nthough there can be any number of worlds within an infinite \ngame. \n7 \nFinite games can be played within an infinite game, but \nan infinite game cannot be played within a finite game. \nInfinite players regard their wins and losses in whatever \nfinite games they playas but moments in continuing play. \n8 \nIf finite games must be externally bounded by time, space, \nand number , they must also have internal limitations on what \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 7\n\f\nthe players can do to and with each other . To agree on internal \nlimitations is to establish rules of play. \nThe rules will be different for each finite game. It is, in \nfact, by knowing what the rules are that we know what the \ngame is. \nWhat the rules establish is a range of limitations on the \nplayers: each player must, for example, start behind the white \nline, or have all debts paid by the end of the month, charge \npatients no more than they can reasonably afford, or drive \nin the right lane. \nIn the narrowest sense rules are not laws; they do not man­\ndate specific behavior, but only restrain the freedom of the \nplayers, allowing considerable room for choice within those \nrestraints . \nIf these restraints are not observed, the outcome of the \ngame is directly threatened . The rules of a finite game are \nthe contractual terms by which the players can agree who \nhas won. \n9 \nThe rules must be published prior to play, and the players \nmust agree to them before play begins. \nA point of great consequence to all finite play follows from \nthis: The agreement of the players to the applicable rules consti­\ntutes the ultimate validation of those rules. \nRules are not valid because the Senate passed them , or \nbecause heroes once played by them, or because God pro­\nnounced them through Moses or Muhammad. They are valid \nonly if and when players freely play by them . \n8\n\f\nThere are no rules that require us to obey rules. If there \nwere, there would have to be a rule for those rules, and so \non. \n10 \nIf the rules of a finite game are unique to that game it is \nevident that the rules may not change in the course of play­\nelse a different game is being played. \nIt is on this point that we find the most critical distinction \nbetween finite and infinite play: The rules of an infinite game \nmust change in the course of play. The rules are changed \nwhen the players of an infinite game agree that the play is \nimperiled by a finite outcome-that is, by the victory of some \nplayers and the defeat of others. \nThe rules of an infinite game are changed to prevent anyone \nfrom winning the game and to bring as many persons as possi­\nble into the play. \nIf the rules of a finite game are the contractual terms by \nwhich the players can agree who has won, the rules of an \ninfinite game are the contractual terms by which the players \nagree to continue playing. \nFor this reason the rules of an infinite game have a different \nstatus from those of a finite game . They are like the grammar \nof a living language, where those of a finite game are like \nthe rules of debate. In the former case we observe rules as \na way of continuing discourse with each other ; in the latter \nwe observe rules as a way of bringing the speech of another \nperson to an end. \nThe rules, or grammar, of a living language are always evolv-\nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 9\n\f\ning to guarantee the meaningfulness of discourse, while the \nrules of debate must remain constant. \n11 \nAlthough the rules of an infinite game may change by agree­\nment at any point in the course of play, it does not follow \nthat any rule will do. I t is not in this sense that the game \nis infinite. \nThe rules are always designed to deal with specific threats \nto the continuation of play. Infinite players use the rules to \nregulate the way they will take the boundaries or limits being \nforced against their play into the game itself. \nThe rule-making capacity of infinite players is often chal­\nlenged by the impingement of powerful boundaries against \ntheir play-such as physical exhaustion, or the loss of material \nresources, or the hostility of nonplayers, or death . \nThe task is to design rules that will allow the players to \ncontinue the game by taking these limits into play-even \nwhen death is one of the limits. It is in this sense that the \ngame is infinite . \nThis is equivalent to saying that no limitation may be im­\nposed against infinite play. Since limits are taken into play, \nthe play itself cannot be limited . \nFinite players play within boundaries ; infinite players play \nwith boundaries . \n12 \nAlthough it may be evident enough in theory that whoever \nplays a finite game plays freely, it is often the case that finite \n10\n\f\nplayers will be unaware of this absolute freedom and will come \nto think that whatever they do they must do. There are several \npossible reasons for this: \n-We saw that finite players must be selected. While \nno one is forced to remain a lawyer or a rodeo performer or \na kundalini yogi after being selected for these roles, each role \nis nonetheless surrounded both by ruled restraints and expecta­\ntions on the part of others . One senses a compulsion to main­\ntain a certain level of performance, because permission to \nplay in these games can be canceled . We cannot do whatever \nwe please and remain lawyers or yogis-and yet we could \nnot be either unless we pleased. \n-Since finite games are played to be won, players make \nevery move in a game in order to win it. Whatever is not \ndone in the interest of winning is not part of the game. The \nconstant attentiveness of finite players to the progress of the \ncompetition can lead them to believe that every move they \nmake they must make. \n-I t may appear that the prizes for winning are indispensa­\nble, that without them life is meaningless, perhaps even impos­\nsible. There are, to be sure, games in which the stakes seem \nto be life and death . In slavery, for example, or severe political \noppression, the refusal to play the demanded role may be \npaid for with terrible suffering or death. \nEven in this last, extreme case we must still concede that \nwhoever takes up the commanded role does so by choice. \nCertainly the price for refusing it is high, but that there is \na price at all points to the fact that oppressors themselves \nacknowledge that even the weakest of their subjects must \nagree to be oppressed . If the subjects were unresisting puppets \nor automatons, no threat would be necessary, and no price \nwould be paid-thus the satire of the putative ideal of oppres-\nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 11\n\f\nsors in Huxley's Gammas, Orwell's Proles, and Rossum's Uni­\nversal Robots (Capek) . \nUnlike infinite play, finite play is limited from without; \nlike infinite play, those limitations must be chosen by the \nplayer since no one is under any necessity to play a finite \ngame. Fields of play simply do not impose themselves on \nus. Therefore, all the limitations of finite play are self-limita­\ntions. \n13 \nTo account for the large gap between the actual freedom \nof finite players to step off the field of play at any time and \nthe experienced necessity to stay at the struggle, we can say \nthat as finite players we somehow veil this freedom from our­\nselves. \nSome self-veiling is present in all finite games. Players must \nintentionally forget the inherently voluntary nature of their \nplay, else all competitive effort will desert them . \nFrom the outset of finite play each part or position must \nbe taken up with a certain seriousness; players must see them ­\nselves as teacher, as light-heavyweight, as mother. In the \nproper exercise of such roles we positively believe we are the \npersons those roles portray . Even more: we make those roles \nbelievable to others. I t is in the nature of acting, Shaw said, \nthat we are not to see this woman as Ophelia, but Ophelia \nas this woman . \nIf the actress is so skillful that we do see Ophelia as this \nwoman, it follows that we do not see performed emotions \nand hear recited words, but a person's true feelings and speech. \nTo some extent the actress does not see herself performing \nbut feels her performed emotion and actually says her memo-\n12"

    "raw_text": "rized lines-and yet the very fact that they are performed \nmeans that the words and feelings belong to the role and \nnot to the actress. In fact, it is one of the requirements of \nher craft that she keep her own person distinct from the \nrole. What she feels as the person she is has nothing to do \nwith Ophelia and must not enter into her playing of the \npart. \nOf course, not for a second will this woman in her acting \nbe unaware that she is acting . She never forgets that she \nhas veiled herself sufficiently to play this role, that she has \nchosen to forget for the moment that she is this woman and \nnot Ophelia . But then, neither do we as audience forget we \nare audience . Even though we see this woman as Ophelia, \nwe are never in doubt that she is not. We are in complicity \nwith her veil. We allow her performed emotions to ~ffect \nus, perhaps powerfully. But we never forget that we allow \nthem to do so. \nSo it is with all roles. Only freely can one step into the \nrole of mother . Persons who assume this role, however, must \nsuspend their freedom with a proper seriousness in order to \nact as the role requires. A mother's words, actions, and feelings \nbelong to the role and not to the person-although some \npersons may veil themselves so assiduously that they make \ntheir performance believable even to themselves, overlooking \nany distinction between a mother's feelings and their own. \nThe issue here is not whether self-veiling can be avoided, \nor even should be avoided. Indeed, no finite play is possible \nwithout it. The issue is whether we are ever willing to .drop \nthe veil and openly acknowledge, if only to ourselves, that \nwe have freely chosen to face the world through a mask. \nConsider the actress whose skill at making Ophelia appear \nas this woman demonstrates the clarity with which she can \ndistinguish the role from herself. Is it not possible that when \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 13\n\f\nshe leaves the stage she does not give up acting, but simply \nleaves off one role for another, say the role of \"actress,\" an \nabstracted personage whose public behavior is carefully \nscripted and produced? At which point do we confront the \nfact that we live one life and perform another, or others, \nattempting to make our momentary forgetting true and lasting \nforgetting? \nWhat makes this an issue is not the morality of masking \nourselves. It is rather that self-veiling is a contradictory act­\na free suspension of our freedom . I cannot forget that I have \nforgotten. I may have used the veil so successfully that I have \nmade my performance believable to myself. I may have con­\nvinced myself I am Ophelia. But credibility will never suffice \nto undo the contradictoriness of self-veiling. \"To believe is \nto know you believe, and to know you believe is not to believe\" \n(Sartre). \nIf no amount of veiling can conceal the veiling itself, the \nissue is how far we will go in our seriousness at self-veiling, \nand how far we will go to have others act in complicity with \nus. \n14 \nSince finite games can be played within an infinite game, \ninfinite players do not eschew the performed roles of finite \nplay. On the contrary, they enter into finite games with all \nthe appropriate energy and self-veiling, but they do so without \nthe seriousness of finite players. They embrace the abstractness \nof finite games as abstractness , and therefore take them up \nnot seriously, but playfully.

For that reason they regard each participant \nin finite play as that person playing and not as a role played \nby someone. \nSeriousness is always related to roles, or abstractions . We \nare likely to be more serious with police officers when we \nfind them uniformed and performing their mandated roles \nthan when we find them in the process of changing into \ntheir uniforms . Seriousness always has to do with an established \nscript, an ordering of affairs completed somewhere outside \nthe range of our influence.

On the contrary, \nwhen we are playful with each other we relate as free persons, \nand the relationship is open to surprise; everything that hap­\npens is of consequence .

    "raw_text": "players are concrete persons engaged with concrete persons. \nFor that reason an infinite game cannot be abstracted, for \nit is not a part of the whole presenting itself as the whole, \nbut the whole that knows it is the whole. We cannot say a \nperson played this infinite game or that, as though the rules \nare independent of the concrete circumstances of play. It \ncan be said only that these persons played with each other \nand in such a way that what they began cannot be finished. \n15 \nInasmuch as a finite game is intended for conclusion, inas­\nmuch as its roles are scripted and performed for an audience, \nwe shall refer to finite playas theatrical. Although script and \nplot do not seem to be written in advance, we are always \nable to look back at the path followed to victory and say of \nthe winners that they certainly knew how to act and what \nto say. \nInasmuch as infinite players avoid any outcome whatsoever, \nkeeping the future open, making all scripts useless, we shall \nrefer to infinite playas dramatic. \nDramatically, one chooses to be a mother ; theatrically, one \ntakes on the role of mother. \n16 \nOne obeys the rules in a finite game in order to play, but \nplaying does not consist only in obeying rules. \nThe rules of a finite game do not constitute a scr~pt. A \nscript is composed according to the rules but is not identical \nto the rules. The script is the record of the actual exchanges \n16\n\f\nbetween players-whether acts or words-and therefore can­\nnot be written down beforehand. In all true finite play the \nscripts are composed in the course of play. \nThis means that during the game all finite play is dramatic, \nsince the outcome is yet unknown . That the outcome is not \nknown is what makes it a true game. The theatricality of \nfinite play has to do with the fact that there is an outcome. \nFinite play is dramatic, but only provisionally dramatic. \nAs soon as it is concluded we are able to look backward and \nsee how the sequence of moves, though made freely by the \ncompetitors, could have resulted only in this outcome. We \ncan see how every move fit into a sequence that made it \ninevitable that this player would win. \nThe fact that a finite game is provisionally dramatic means \nthat it is the intention of each player to eliminate its drama \nby making a preferred end inevitable. It is the desire of all \nfinite players to be Master Players, to be so perfectly skilled \nin their play that nothing can surprise them, so perfectly \ntrained that every move in the game is foreseen at the begin­\nning. A true Master Player plays as though the game is already \nin the past, according to a script whose every detail is known \nprior to the play itself. \n17 \nSurprise is a crucial element in most finite games. If we \nare not prepared to meet each of the possible moves of an \nopponent, our chances of losing are most certainly increased. \nIt is therefore by surprising our opponent that we are most \nlikely to win. Surprise in finite play is the triumph of the \npast over the future. The Master Player who already knows \nwhat moves are to be made has a decisive advantage over \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 17\n\f\nthe unprepared player who does not yet know what moves \nwill be made . \nA finite player is trained not only to anticipate every future \npossibility, but to control the future, to prevent it from altering \nthe past. This is the finite player in the mode of seriousness \nwith its dread of unpredictable consequence . \nInfinite players, on the other hand, continue their play in \nthe expectation of being surprised. If surprise is no longer \npossible, all play ceases. \nSurprise causes finite play to end ; it is the reason for infinite \nplay to continue. \nSurprise in infinite play is the triumph of the future over \nthe past. Since infinite players do not regard the past as having \nan outcome , they have no way of knowing what has been \nbegun there. With each surprise, the past reveals a new begin­\nning in itself. Inasmuch as the future is always surprising, \nthe past is always changing. \nBecause finite players are trained to prevent the future from \naltering the past, they must hide their future moves. The \nunprepared opponent must be kept unprepared . Finite players \nmust appear to be something other than what they are. Every­\nthing about their appearance must be concealing . To appear \nis not to appear. All the moves of a finite player must be \ndeceptive : feints, distractions, falsifications, misdirections, \nmystifications . \nBecause infinite players prepare themselves to be surprised \nby the future, they play in complete openness . It is not an \nopenness as in candor, but an openness as in vulnerability. \nIt is not a matter of exposing one's unchanging identity, the \ntrue self that has always been, but a way of exposing one's \nceaseless growth, the dynamic self that has yet to be. The \ninfinite player does not expect only to be amused by surprise, \n18\n\f\nbut to be transformed by it, for surprise does not alter some \nabstract past, but one's own personal past. \nTo be prepared against surprise is to be trained. To be \nprepared for surprise is to be educated. \nEducation discovers an increasing richness in the past, be­\ncause it sees what is unfinished there . Training regards the \npast as finished and the future as to be finished. Education \nleads toward a continuing self-discovery; training leads toward \na final self-definition. \nTraining repeats a completed past in the future . Education \ncontinues an unfinished past into the future . \n18 \nWhat one wins in a finite game is a title. \nA title is the acknowledgment of others that one has been \nthe winner of a particular game. Titles are public. They are \nfor others to notice. I expect others to address me according \nto my titles, but I do not address myself with them-unless, \nof course, I address myself as an other . The effectiveness of \na title depends on its visibility, its noticeabilit ~, to others . \n19 \nAny given finite game can be played many times, although \neach occasion of its occurrence is unique . The game that \nwas played at that time by those players can never be played \nagam. \nSince titles are ~imeless , but exist only so far as they are \nacknowledged, we must find means to guarantee the memory \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 19\n\f\nof them . The birettas of dead cardinals are suspended from \nthe ceilings of cathedrals, as it were forever; the numbers of \ngreat athletes are \"retired\" or withdrawn from all further play; \ngreat achievements are carved in imperishable stone or memo­\nrialized by perpetual flames. \nSome titles are inherited, though only when the bloodline \nor some other tangible connection with the original winner \nhas been established, suggesting that the winners have contin­\nued to exist in their descendants . The heirs to titles are there­\nfore obliged to display the appropriate emblems: a coat of \narms or identifiable styles of speech, clothing, or behavior. \nI t is a principal function of society to validate titles and \nto assure their perpetual recognition . \n20 \nIt is in connection with the timelessness of titles that we \ncan first discern the importance of death to both finite and \ninfinite game!) and the great difference between the ways death \nis understo.cd in each. \nA finite game must always be won with a terminal move, \na final act within the boundaries of the game that establishes \nthe winner beyond any possibility of challenge. A terminal \nmove results, in other words, in the death of the opposing \nplayer as player. The winner kills the opponent. The loser \nis dead in the sense of being incapable of further play. \nProperly speaking, life and death as such are rarely the \nstakes of a finite game. What one wins is a title; and when \nthe loser of a finite game is declared dead to further play, it \nis equivalent to declaring that person utterly without title-\n20\n\f\na person to whom no attention whatsoever need be given. \nDeath, in finite play, is the triumph of the past over the \nfuture, a condition in which no surprise is possible. \nFor this reason, death for a finite player need have nothing \nto do with the physical demise of the body; it is not a reference \nto a corporeal state . There are two ways in which death is \ncommonly associated with the fate of the body: One can be \ndead in life, or one can be alive in death . \nDeath in life is a mode of existence in which one has ceased \nall play; there is no further striving for titles. All competitive \nengagement with others has been abandoned . For some, \nthough not for all, death in life is a misfortune, the resigned \nacceptance of a loser's status, a refusal to hold any title up \nfor recognition. For others, however, death in life can be \nregarded as an achievement, the result of a spiritual discipline, \nsay, intended to extinguish all traces of struggle with the world, \na liberation from the need for any title whatsoever. \"Die before \nye die,\" declare the Sufi mystics. \nLife in death concerns those who are titled and whose \ntitles, since they are timeless, may not be extinguished by \ndeath. Immortality, in this case, is not a reward but the condi­\ntion necessary to the possession of rewards. Victors live forever \nnot because their souls are unaffected by death but because \ntheir titles must not be forgotten. \nIt was not merely the souls of the Egyptian pharaohs that \npassed on into the afterlife, but their complete offices and \nroles, along with all the tangible reminders of their earthly \ntriumphs-including servants put to death that they might \naccompany their titled masters into eternity. For Christian \nsaints \"death has lost its sting\" not because there is something \ninherently imperishable in the human soul, but because they \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 21\n\f\nhave fought the good fight, and they have successfully pressed \non \"toward the goal for the prize of the upward caiI of God \nin Christ Jesus\" (Paul). \nSoldiers commonly achieve a life in death. Soldiers fight \nnot to stay alive but to save the nation. Those who do fight \nonly to protect themselves are, in fact, considered guilty of \nthe highest military crimes. Soldiers who die fighting the en­\nemy, however, receive the nation's highest reward: They are \ndeclared unforgettable. Even unknown soldiers are memorial­\nized-though their names have been lost, their titles will not \nbe. \nWhat the winners of finite games achieve is not properly \nan afterlife but an afterworld, not continuing existence but \ncontinuing recognition of their titles. \n21 \nThere are games in which the stakes do seem to be life \nand death . \nExtreme forms of bondage sometimes ofter persons the priv­\nilege of staying alive in exchange for their play-and death \nfor refusing to play. There is, however, something odd in \nthis exchange . A slave does not so much receive a life as \ngive a life-a life whose only function is to reflect the master's \nsuperiority. The slave's life is the property of the master; the \nslave exists only as an emblem of the master's prior victories. \nA slave can have life only by giving it away. \"He who \nloves his life loses it, and he who hates his life in this world \nwill keep it for eternal life\" (Jesus). \nPerhaps a more common example of such life-or-death forms \nof bondage is found in those persons who resort to expensive \nmedical strategies to be cured of life-threatening illness. They, \n22\n\f\ntoo, seem to be giving life away in order to win it back. So \nalso are those who observe special diets or patterns of life \ndesigned to prolong their youth and to postpone aging and \ndeath indefinitely; they hate their life in this world now in \norder that they may have it later. And just as with slaves, \nthe life they receive is given to them by others : doctors, yogis, \nor their anonymous admirers . \nWhen life is viewed by a finite player as the award to be \nwon, then death is a token of defeat. Death is not, therefore, \nchosen, but inflicted . It happens to one when the struggle \nagainst it fails. Death comes as a judgment , a dishonor, a \nsign of certain weakness. Death for the finite player is deserved, \nearned. \"The wages of sin is death \" (Paul). \nIf the losers are dead, the dead are also losers. \nThere is a contradiction here: If the prize for winning finite \nplay is life, then the players are not properly alive. They are \ncompeting for life. Life, then, is not play, but the outcome \nof play. Finite players play to live; they do not live their \nplaying. Life is therefore deserved, bestowed, possessed, won. \nI t is not lived. \"Life itself appears only as a means to life\" \n(Marx). \nThis is a contradiction common to all finite play. Because \nthe purpose of a finite game is to bring play to an end with \nthe victory of one of the players, each finite game is played \nto end itself. The contradiction is precisely that all finite play \nis play against itself. \n22 \nDeath, for finite players, is abstract, not concrete . It is \nnot the whole person, but only an abstracted fragment of \nthe whole, that dies in life or lives in death . \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 23\n\f\nSo aL is life abstract for finite players. It is not the whole \nperson who lives. If life is a means to life, we must abstract \nourselves, but only for the sake of winning an abstraction . \nImmortality, therefore, is the triumph of such abstraction . \nIt is a state of unrelieved theatricality. An immortal soul is \na person who cannot help but continue living out a role already \nscripted. An immortal person could not choose to die nor, \nfor the same reason, choose to live. Immortality is serious \nand in no way playful. One's actions can have no consequence \nbeyond themselves. There are no surprises in the afterworld. \nOf course, immortality of the soul-the bare soul, cleansed \nof any personality traces-is rarely what is desired in the yearn­\ning for immortality . \"The information that my soul is to last \nforever could then be of no more personal concern to me \nthan the news that my appendix is to be preserved eternally \nin a bottle \" (Flew). More often what one intends to preserve \nis a public personage, a permanently veiled selfhood. Immortal­\nity is the state of forgetting that we have forgotten-that \nis, overlooking the fact that we freely decided to enter into \nfinite play, a decision in itself playful and not serious. \nImmortality is therefore the supreme example of the contra­\ndictoriness of finite play: It is a life one cannot live. \n23 \nInfinite players die. Since the boundaries of death are always \npart of the play, the infinite player does not die at the end \nof play, but in the course of play. \nThe death of an infinite player is dramatic . It does not \nmean that the game comes to an end with death ; on the \ncontrary , infinite players offer their death as a way of continu ­\ning the play. For that reason they do not play for their own \n24"

    "raw_text": "The contradiction of finite play is that the players desire to \nbring play to an end for themselves . The paradox of infinite \nplay is that the players desire to continue the play in others. \nThe paradox is precisely that they play only when others go \non with the game . \nInfinite players play best when they become least necessary \nto the continuation of play. It is for this reason they playas \nmortals. \nThe joyfulness of infinite play, its laughter, lies in learning \nto start something we cannot finish. \n25 \nIf finite players acquire titles from winning their games, \nwe must say of infinite players that they have nothing but \ntheir names. \nNames, like titles, are given. Persons cannot name them ­\nselves any more than they can entitle themselves . However, \nunlike titles, which are given for what a person has done, a \nname is given at birth-at a time when a person cannot yet \nhave done anything. Titles are given at the end of play, names \nat the beginning. \nWhen a person is known by title, the attention is on a \ncompleted past, on a game already concluded, and not there­\nfore to be played again. A title effectively takes a person out \nof play. \nWhen a person is known only by name, the attention of \nothers is on an open future. We simply cannot know what \nto expect. Whenever we address each other by name we ignore \nall scripts, and open the possibility that our relationship will \nbecome deeply reciprocal. That I cannot now predict your \nfuture is exactly what makes mine unpredictable . Our futures \n26\n\f\nenter into each other. What is your future, and mine, becomes \nours. We prepare each other for surprise. \nTitles are abstractions; names are always concrete . \nIt can happen that when persons are distinctly identified \nas winners their names can have the force of titles. We some­\ntimes act \"to clear our name\" of aspersions, or to defend \nthe \"good name of our family.\" Names can even become \ntitles in the formal sense, such as \"Caesar,\" or \"Napoleon,\" \nor \"the name of Jesus which is above every name \" (Paul) . \nWhen Jesus is regarded by way of a title instead of a name, \nhe becomes an abstracted, theatrical role, a person with whom \nwe can share no future, rather a Master Player in whose future \nwe live in a manner that has already been scripted, or decided, \nfor us. \"Before Abraham was, I am,\" Jesus said of himself \nin the Gospel of John . \n26 \nTitles, then, point backward in time . They have their origin \nin an unrepeatable past. \nTitles are theatrical . Each title has a specified ceremonial \nform of address and behavior. Titles such as Captain, Mrs ., \nLord, Esquire, Professor, Comrade, Father, Under Secretary, \nsignal not only a mode of address with its appropriate defer­\nence or respect, but also a content of address (only certain \nsubjects are suitable for discussion with the Admiral of the \nFleet or the District Attorney or the Holy Mother), and a \nmanner of address (shaking hands, kneeling, prostrating or \ncrossing oneself, saluting, bowing, averting the eyes, or stand­\ning in silence). \nThe mode and content of address and the manner of behav­\nior are recognitions of the areas in which titled persons are \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 27\n\f\nno longer in competition . There are precise ways in. which \none may no longer compete with the Dalai Lama or the Heavy­\nweight Champion of the World . There is no possible action \nby which one may deprive them of their titles to contests \nnow in the past. Therefore , insofar as we recognize their titles \nwe withdraw from any contest with them in those areas. \n27 \nThe titled are powerful. Those around them are expected \nto yield, to withdraw their opposition , and to conform to \ntheir will-in the arena in which the title was won. \nThe exercise of power always presupposes resistance. Power \nis never evident until two or more elements are in opposition . \nWhichever element can move another is the more powerful. \nIf no one else ever strove to be a Boddhisattva or the Baton \nTwirling Champion of the State of Indiana, those titles would \nbe powerless-no one would defer to them . \nThe exercise of power also presupposes a closed field and \nfinite units of time. My power is determined by the amount \nof resistance I can displace within given spatial and temporal \nlimits. The question is not whether I can lift ten pounds, \nbut whether I can lift ten pounds five feet off the ground \nin one second--{)r within some other precise limitation of \ntime and space. The establishment of the limits makes it \npossible to know how powerful I am in relation to others. \nPower is always measured in units of comparison . In fact, \nit is a term of competition : How much resistance can I over­\ncome relative to others? \nPower is a concept that belongs only in finite play. But \npower is not properly measurable until the game is com­\npleted-until the designated period of time has run out. Dur-\n28"

    "raw_text": "ing the course of play we cannot yet determine the power \nof the players, because to the degree that it is genuine play \nthe outcome is unknown . A player who is being pushed all \nover the field by an apparently superior opponent may display \nan unsuspected burst of activity at the end and take the victory. \nUntil the final hours of the count in the presidential election \nof 1948 many Americans thought that Harry Truman was a \nfar weaker candidate than Thomas Dewey. \nTo speak meaningfully of a person's power is to speak of \nwhat that person has already completed in one or another \nclosed field. To see power is to look backward in time. \nInasmuch as power is determined by the outcome of a \ngame, one does not win by being powerful; one wins to be \npowerful. If one has sufficient power to win before the game \nhas begun , what follows is not a game at all. \nOne can be powerful only through the possession of an \nacknowledged title-that is, only by the ceremonial deference \nof others . Power is never one's own, and in that respect it \nshows the contradiction inherent in all finite play. I can be \npowerful only by not playing, by showing that the game is \nover. I can therefore have only what powers others give me. \nPower is bestowed by an audience after the play is complete . \nPower is contradictory, and theatrical . \n28 \nIt may seem implausible to claim that power is a matter \nof deference to titles. If anything appears to be a permanent \nfeature of reality it is power-the constant impingement on \nus of superior forces both without and within . Everything \nfrom changes in the weather and acts of national governments \nto the irresistible push of instinct and the process of aging \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 29\n\f\nseems to confirm us as helpless creatures of circumstance­\nand to that degree powerless. It seems plainly false to say \nthat power is theatrical. \nAnd yet, the theatrical nature of power seems to be consis­\ntent with the principle arrived at earlier: Whoever must play \ncannot play. The intuitive idea in that principle is that no \none can engage us competitively unless we fully cooperate, \nunless we join the game and join it to win. Because power \nis measurable only in comparative-that is, competitiv e­\nterms, it presupposes some kind of cooperation . If we defer \nto titled winners, it is only because we regard ourselves as \nlosers. To do so is freely to take part in the theater of power. \nThere certainly are acts of government, or acts of nature , \nor acts of god that far exceed any contravening ability of \nour own, but it is unlikely that we would consider ourselves \nlosers in relation to them . We are not defeated by floods or \ngenetic disease or the rate of inflation. It is true that these \nare real, but we do not play against reality; we play according \nto reality. We do not eliminate weather or genetic influence \nbut accept them as the realities that establish the context \nof play, the limits within which we are to play. \nIf I accept death as inevitable, I do not struggle against \nmortality. I struggle as a mortal. \nAll the limitations of finite play are self-limitations. \n29 \nPower is a feature only of finite games. It is not dramatic \nbut theatrical. How then do infinite players contend with \npower? Infinite play is always dramatic ; its outcome is endlessly \nopen . There is no way of looking back to make a definitive \nassessment of the power or weakness of earlier play. Infinite \n30\n\f\nplayers look forward, not to a victory in which the past will \nachieve a timeless meaning, but toward ongoing play in which \nthe past will require constant reinterpretation. Infinite players \ndo not oppose the actions of others , but initiate actions of \ntheir own in such a way that others will respond by initiating \ntheir own. \nWe need a term that will stand in contrast to \"power\" \nas it acquires its meaning in finite play. Let us say that where \nthe finite player plays to be powerful the infinite player plays \nwith strength. \nA powerful person is one who brings the past to an outcome , \nsettling all its unresolved issues. A strong person is one who \ncarries the past into the future , showing that none of its issues \nis capable of resolution. Power is concerned with what has \nalready happened ; strength with what has yet to happen. \nPower is finite in amount. Strength cannot be measured, be­\ncause it is an opening and not a closing act. Power refers to \nthe freedom persons have within limits, strength to the free-\ndom persons have with limits. _ \nPower will always be restricted to a relatively small number \nof selected persons. Anyone can be strong. \nStrength is paradoxical. I am not strong because I can force \nothers to do what I wish as a result of my play with them, \nbut because I can allow them to do what they wish in the \ncourse of my play with them. \n30 \nAlthough anyone who wishes can be an infinite player, and \nalthough anyone can be strong, we are not to suppose that \npower cannot work irremediable damage on infinite play.

It is infinite play \ncoming to an end in unheard silence. \nUnheard silence does not necessarily mean the death of \nthe player. Unheard silence is not the loss of the player's \nvoice, but the loss of listeners for that voice. It is an evil \nwhen the drama of a life does not continue in others for \nreason of their deafness or ignorance . \nThere are silences that can be heard, even from the dead \nand from the severely oppressed. Much is recoverable from \nan apparently forgotten past. Sensitive and faithful historians \ncan learn much of what has been lost, and much therefore \nthat can be continued . \nThere are silences, however, that will never and can never \nbe heard . There is much evil that remains beyond redemption. \nWhen Europeans first landed on the North American conti­\nnent the native population spoke as many as ten thousand \ndistinct languages, each with its own poetry and treasury of \nhistories and myths, its own ways of living in harmony with \nthe spontaneities of the natural environment. All but a very \nfew of those tongues have been silenced, their cultures forever \nlost to those of us who stand ignorantly in their place. \nEvil is not the termination of a finite game. Finite players, \neven those who play for their own lives, know the stakes of \nthe games they freely choose to play. \nEvil is not the attempt to eliminate the play of another \naccording to published and accepted rules, but to eliminate \nthe play of another regardless of the rules. Evil is not the \nacquisition of power, but the expression of power. It is the \nforced recognition of a title-and therein lies the contradiction \nof evil, for recognition cannot be forced. The Nazis did not \ncompete with the Jews for a title, but demanded recognition \n32\n\f\nof a title without competition . This could be achieved, how­\never, only by silencing the Jews, only by hearing nothing from \nthem . They were to die in silence, along with their culture, \nwithout anyone noticing, not even those who managed the \ninstitutions and instruments of death. \n31 \nEvil is never intended as evil. Indeed , the contradiction \ninherent in all evil is that it originates in the desire to eliminate \nevil. \"The only good Indian is a dead Indian .\" \nEvil arises in the honored belief that history can be tidied \nup, brought to a sensible conclusion. I t is evil to act as though \nthe past is bringing us to a specifiable end. It is evil to assume \nthat the past will make sense only if we bring it to an issue \nwe have clearly in view. It is evil for a nation to believe it \nis \"the last, best hope on earth .\" It is evil to think history \nis to end with a return to Zion, or with the classless society, \nor with the Islamicization of all living infidels. \nYour history does not belong to me. We live with each \nother in a common history. \nInfinite players understand the inescapable likelihood of \nevil. The y therefore do not attempt to eliminate evil in others, \nfor to do so is the very impulse of evil itself, and therefore \na contradiction . The y only attempt paradoxically to recognize \nin themselves the evil that takes the form of attempting to \neliminate evil elsewhere. \nEvil is not the inclusion of finite games in an infinite game, \nbut the restriction of all play to one or another finite game. \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 33\n\f\n\n\f\nTWO \nNo ONE CAN \nPLAY A GAME \nALONE"

    "raw_text": "32 \nNo ONE CAN PLAya game alone. One cannot be human by \noneself. There is no selfhood where there is no community . \nWe do not relate to others as the persons we are; we are \nwho we are in relating to others. \nSimultaneously the others with whom we are in relation \nare themselves in relation . We cannot relate to anyone who \nis not also relating to us. Our social existence has, therefore , \nan inescapably fluid character . This is not to say that we \nlive in a fluid context, but that our lives are themselves fluid. \nAs in the Zen image we are not the stones over which the \nstream of the world flows; we are the stream itself. As we \nshall see, this ceaseless change does not mean discontinuit y; \nrather change is itself the very basis of our continuity as per­\nsons. Onl y that which can change can continue : this is the \nprinciple by which infinite players live. \nThe fluidity of our social and therefore personal existence \nis a function of our essential freedom-the kind of freedom \nindicated in the formula \"Who must play, cannot play.\" Of \ncourse, as we have seen, finite games cannot have fluid bound ­\naries, for if they do it will be impossible to agree on winners. \nBut finite games float, as it were, in the unconstrained choice \neach player makes in entering and continuing the play. Finite \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 37\n\f\ngames sometimes appear, therefore, to have fixed points of \nsocial reference . Not only are there true and false ways of \nloving your country, for example; there is a positive require­\nment that you do so. \nIt is this essential fluidity of our humanness that is irreconcil­\nable with the seriousness of finite play. It is, therefore, this \nfluidity that presents us with an unavoidable challenge: how \nto contain the serious within the truly playful; that is, how \nto keep all our finite games in infinite play. \nThis challenge is commonly misunderstood as the need to \nfind room for playfulness within finite games. This is what \nwas referred to above as playing at, or perhaps playing around, \na kind of play that has no consequence . This is the sort of \nplayfulness implied in the ordinary sense of such terms as \nentertainment, amusement, diversion, comic relief, recreation, \nrelaxation . Inevitably, however, seriousness will creep back into \nthis kind of play. The executive's vacation, like the football \nteam 's time out, comes to be a device for refreshing the contes­\ntant for a higher level of competition . Even the open playful­\nness of children is exploited through organized athletic, \nartistic, and educational regimens as a means of preparing \nthe young for serious adult competition . \n33 \nWhen Bismarck described politics as the art of the possible, \nhe meant, of course, that the possible is to be found somewhere \nwithin fixed limits, within social realities. He plainly did not \nmean that the possible extended to those limits themselves. \nSuch a politics is therefore seriousness itself, especially since \npoliticians of nearly every ideology represent themselves as \nchampions of freedom, doing what is necessary and even dis-\n38\n\f\ntasteful toward the end of enlarging the range of the possible. \n\"We must learn the fine arts of war and independence so \nthat our children can learn architecture and engineering so \nthat their children may learn the fine arts and painting\" (John \nQuincy Adams) . \nThe interest of infinite players has little in common with \nsuch politics, since they are not concerned to find how much \nfreedom is available within the given realities-for this is free­\ndom only in the trivial sense of playing at-but are concerned \nto show how freely we have decided to place these particular \nboundaries around our finite play. They remind us that political \nrealities do not precede, but follow from, the essential fluidity \nof our humanness . \nThis does not mean that infinite players are politically disen­\ngaged; it means rather that they are political without having \na politics, a paradoxical position easily misinterpreted. To have \na politics is to have a set of rules by which one attempts to \nreach a desired end; to be political-in the sense meant here­\nis to recast rules in the attempt to eliminate all societal ends, \nthat is, to maintain the essential fluidity of human association . \nTo be political in the mode of infinite play is by no means \nto disregard the appalling conditions under which many hu­\nman beings live, the elimination of which is the professed \nend of much politics. We can imagine infinite players nodding \nthoughtfully at Rousseau's famous declaration: \"Man is born \nfree, and everywhere he is in chains .\" They can see that the \ndream of freedom is universal, that wars are fought to win \nit, heroes die to protect it, and songs are written to commemo­\nrate its attainment. But in the infinite player's vision of politi­\ncal affairs the element of intentionality and willfulness, so \neasily obscured in the exigencies of public crisis, stands out \nin clear relief. Therefore, even warfare and heroism are seen \nwith their self-contradictions in full display. No nation can , \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 39\n\f\ngo to war until it has found another that can agree to the \nterms of the conflict. Each side must therefore be in complicity \nwith the other : Before I can have an enemy, I must persuade \nanother to recognize me as an enem y. I cannot be a hero \nunless I can first find someone who will threaten my life­\nor, better , take my life. Once under way, warfare and acts \nof heroism have all the appearance of necessity, but that ap­\npearance is but a veil over the often complicated maneuvers \nby which the antagonists have arranged their conflict with \neach other. \nTherefore, for infinite players, politics is a form of theatrical­\nity. It is the performance of roles before an audience , according \nto a script whose last scene is known in advance by the perform­\ners. The United States did not, for example, lose its war in \nSoutheast Asia so much as lose its audience for a war. No \ndoubt much of the disillusion and bitterness of its warriors \ncomes from the missing final scene-the hero's homecoming \nto parades or ceremon ial burial-an anticipated scene that \ncarries many into battle. \nIt is because of the essential theatricality of politics that \ninfinite players do not take sides in political issues-at least \nnot seriously. Instead they enter into social conflict dramati­\ncally, attempting to offer a vision of continuity and open­\nendedness in place of the heroic final scene. In doing so they \nmust at the very least draw the attention of other political \nparticipants not to what they feel they must do, but to why \nthey feel they must do it. \nIn their own political engagements infinite players make \na distinction between society and culture. Society they under­\nstand as the sum of those relations that are under some form \nof public constraint, culture as whatever we do with each \nother by undirected choice. If society is all that a people \nfeels it must do, culture \" is the realm of the variable, free, \n40\n\f\nnot necessarily universal, of all that cannot lay claim to compul­\nsive authority\" (Burckhardt) . \nThe infinite player's understanding of society is not to be \nconfused with, say, natural instinct, or any other form of invol­\nuntary activity. Society remains entirely within our free choice \nin quite the same way that finite competition, however strenu­\nous or costly to the player, never prevents the player from \nwalking off the field of play. Society applies only to those \nareas of action which are believed to be necessary. \nJust as infinite play cannot be contained within finite play, \nculture cannot be authentic if held within the boundaries \nof a society. Of course, it is often the strategy of a society \nto initiate and embrace a culture as exclusively its own. Culture \nso bounded may even be so lavishly subsidized and encouraged \nby society that it has the appearance of open-ended activity, \nbut in fact it is designed to serve societal interests in every \ncase-like the socialist realism of Soviet art. \nSociety and culture are therefore not true opponents of \neach other. Rather society is a species of culture that persists \nin contradicting itself, a freely organized attempt to conceal \nthe freedom of the organizers and the organized, an attempt \nto forget that we have willfully forgotten our decision to enter \nthis or that contest and to continue in it. \n34 \nIf we think of society as all that a people does under the \nveil of necessity, we must also think of it as a single finite \ngame that includes any number of smaller games within its \nboundaries. \nA large society will consist of a wide variety of games­\nthough all somehow connected, inasmuch as they have a bear-\nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 41\n\f\ning on a final societal ranking . Schools are a species of finite \nplay to the degree that they bestow ranked awards on those \nwho win degrees from them . Those awards in turn qualify \ngraduates for competition in still higher games-certain presti­\ngious colleges, for example, and then certain professional \nschools beyond that, with a continuing sequence of higher \ngames in each of the professions, and so forth. It is not uncom­\nmon for families to think of themselves as a competitive unit \nin a broader finite game for which they are training their \nmembers in the struggle for societally visible titles. \nLike a finite game, a society is numerically, spatially, and \ntemporally limited. Its citizenship is precisely defined, its \nboundaries are inviolable, and its past is enshrined . \nThe power of citizens in a society is determined by their \nranking in games that have been played. A society preserves \nits memory of past winners . Its record-keeping functions are \ncrucial to societal order. Large bureaucracies grow out of the \nneed to verify the numerous entitlements of the citizens of \nthat society. \nThe power of a society is determined by its victory over \nother societies in still larger finite games. Its most treasured \nmemories are those of the heroes fallen in victorious battles \nwith other societies. Heroes of lost battles are almost never \nmemorialized . Foch has his monument, but not Petain; Lin­\ncoln, but not Jefferson Davis; Lenin, but not Trotsky . \nThe power in a society is guaranteed and enhanced by \nthe power of a society. \nThe prizes won by its citizens can be protected only if \nthe society as a whole remains powerful in relation to other \nsocieties. Those who desire the permanence of their prizes \nwill work to sustain the permanence of the whole. Patriotism \nin one or several of its many forms (chauvinism, racism, sexism, \nnationalism, regionalism) is an ingredient in all societal play. \n42\n\f\nBecause power is inherently patriotic, it is characteristic \nof finite players to seek a growth of power in a society as a \nway of increasing the power of a society. It is in the interest \nof a society therefore to encourage competition within itself, \nto establish the largest possible number of prizes, for the hold­\ners of prizes will be those most likely to defend the society \nas a whole against its competitors. \n35 \nCulture, on the other hand, is an infinite game. Culture \nhas no boundaries . Anyone can be a participant in a culture­\nanywhere and at any time . \nBecause a society maintains careful temporal limits, it under­\nstands its past as destiny; that is, its course of history lies \nbetween a definitive beginning (the founders of a society are \nalways especially memorialized) and a definitive ending . (The \nnature of its victory is repeatedly anticipated in official declara­\ntions; \"to each according to their need, from each according \nto their ability,\" for example.) \nBecause culture as such can have no temporal limits, a \nculture understands its past not as destiny, but as history, \nthat is, as a narrative that has begun but points always toward \nthe endlessly open . Culture is an enterprise of mortals, disdain­\ning to protect themselves against surprise. Living in the \nstrength of their vision, they eschew power and make joyous \nplay of boundaries . \nSociety is a manifestation of power. It is theatrical, having \nan established script. Deviations from the script are evident \nat once. Deviation is antisocietal and therefore forbidden by \nsociety under a variety of sanctions . I t is easy to see why \ndeviancy is to be resisted. If persons did not adhere to the \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 43\n\f\nstanding rules of the society, any number of rules would \nchange, and some would be dropped altogether. This would \nmean that past winners no longer warrant ceremonial recogni­\ntion of their titles and are therefore without power-like Rus­\nsian princes after the Revolution . \nI t is a highly valued function of society to prevent changes \nin the rules of the many games it embraces . Such procedures \nas academic accreditation, licensure of trades and professions, \nsynodical ordination, parliamentary confirmation of official ap­\npointments, and the inauguration of political leaders are acts \nof the larger society allowing persons to compete in the finite \ngames within it. \nDeviancy, however, is the very essence of culture. Whoever \nmerely follows the script, merely repeating the past, is cultur-\nally impoverished . . \nThere are variations in the quality of deviation; not all diver­\ngence from the past is culturally significant. Any attempt to \nvary from the past in such a way as to cut the past off, causing \nit to be forgotten, has little cultural importance . Greater signif­\nicance attaches to those variations that bring the tradition \ninto view in a new way, allowing the familiar to be seen as \nunfamiliar, as requiring a new appraisal of all that we have \nbeen-and therefore of all that we are. \nCultural deviation does not return us to the past, but contin­\nues what was begun and not finished in the past. Societal \nconvention, on the other hand, requires that a completed \npast be repeated in the future . Society has all the seriousness \nof immortal necessity; culture resounds with the laughter of \nunexpected possibility. Society is abstract, culture concrete . \nFinite games can be played again; they can be played an \nindefinite number of times. It is true that the winners of a \ngame are always the winners of a game played at that particular \ntime, but the validity of their titles depends on the repeatabil-\n44"

    "raw_text": "ity of that game. We memorialize early football greats but \nwould not do so if football had vanished after its first decade. \nAs we have seen, because an infinite game cannot be brought \nto an end, it cannot be repeated . Unrepeatability is a character­\nistic of culture everywhere. Mozart's Jupiter Symphony cannot \nbe composed again, nor could Rembrandt's self-portraits be \npainted twice. Society preserves these works as the prizes of \nthose who have triumphed in their respective games. Culture, \nhowever, does not consider the works as the outcome of a \nstruggle, but as moments in an ongoing struggle-the very \nstruggle that culture is. Culture continues what Mozart and \nRembrandt had themselves continued by way of their work: \nan original, or deviant, shaping of the tradition they received, \noriginal enough that it does not invite duplication of itself \nby others, but invites the originality of others in response. \nJust as an infinite game has rules, a culture has a tradition . \nSince the rules of play in an infinite game are freely agreed \nto and freely altered, a cultural tradition is both adopted and \ntransformed in its adoption. \nProperly speaking, a culture does not have a tradition ; it \nis a tradition . \n36 \nIt is essential to the identity of a society to forget that it \nhas forgotten that society is always a species of culture. Its \ncitizens must find ways of persuading themselves that their \nown particular boundaries have been imposed on them, and \nwere not freely chosen by them. For example, it is one thing \nfor persons to choose to be Americans, quite another for per­\nsons to choose to be America. Societal thinking easily permits \nthe former, never the latter. \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 45\n\f\nOne of the most effective means of self-persuasion available \nto a citizenry is the bestowal of property . Who actually owns \na society's property, and how it is distributed , are far less \nimportant than the fact that property exists at all. T::> under­\nstand the peculiar dynamic of property we must return to \none of the features of finite play. \nWhat the winner of a finite game wins is a title. A title \nis the acknowledgment of others that one has been the winner \nof a particular game. I cannot entitle myself. Titles are theatri ­\ncal, requiring an audience to bestow and respect them. Power \natta ches to titles inasmuch as those who acknowledge them \naccept the fact that the struggle in which the titles were \nwon cannot be taken up again. Possession of the title signifies \nan agreement that competition is forever closed in that particu­\nlar game . \nIt is therefore essential to the effectiveness of every title \nthat it be visible and that in its visibility it point back at \nthe contest in which it was won. The purpose of property is \nto make our titles visible. Property is emblemati c. It recalls \nto others those areas in which our victories are beyond chal­\nlenge. \nProperty may be stolen, but the thief does not therefor e \nown it. Ownership can never be stolen . Titles are timeless, \nand so is the ownership of property . Nations will sometimes \ngo to war over claims to the ownership of land that go back \nmany centuries . Titles can be inherited, and when they are \nthere is an appropriate transfer of property to the heir-who \nmust, of course, possess the very worthiness by which the \ninheritor originally secured the title . (An inheritance can often \nbe legally challenged by demonstrating the heir's incompe­\ntence or immorality .) \nA thief, however, does not mean to steal the title. A thief \ndoes not want to take what belongs to someone else. The \n46\n\f\nthief does not compete with me for the articles I have title \nto, but for the title to those articles. The thief means to \nwin the title, believing that those things to which I claim \ntitle belong to no one and are there for the taking. \"If you \ndon't take pocket-handkechers and watches,\" explains the Art­\nful Dodger to Oliver, \"some other cove will; so that the coves \nthat lost' em will be all the worse, and you'll be all the worse \ntoo and nobody half a ha'p'orth the better, except the chaps \nwot gets them-and you've just as good a right to them as \nthey have.\" \n37 \nOne reason for the necessity of a society is its role in ascrib­\ning and validating the titles to property. \"The great and chief \nend therefore, of Mens uniting into Commonwealths, and \nputting themselves under Government, is the preservation \nof their Property; to which in the state of nature there are \nmany things wanting\" (Locke). \nWhen we ask precisely how a society will go about preserv­\ning its citizens' property, we can expect the reply that it will \ndo so by the use of force. This reply introduces a dilemma . \nWhile it is true that there are ways of forcibly restraining a \nthief, it is also true that no amount of force can lead the \nArtful Dodger truly to acknowledge a gentleman's title to \nthe handkerchief in his pocket. Until the young ruffian is \npersuaded freely to respect that title, he will remain a thief . \nBy extension, this observation applies to the society as a whole. \nThere is no effective pattern of entitlement in a society short \nof the free agreement of all opponents that the titles to prop­\nerty are in the hands of the actual winners. \nNo force will establish this agreement. Indeed, the opposite \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 47\n\f\nis the case: It is agreement that establishes force. Only those \nwho consent to a society's constraints see them as constraints­\nthat is, as guides to action and not as actions to be opposed. \nThose who challenge the existing pattern of entitlements \nin a society do not consider the designated officers of enforce­\nment powerful; they consider them opponents in a struggle \nthat will determine by its outcome who is powerful. One \ndoes not win by power; one wins to be powerful. \nOnly by free self-concealment can persons believe they obey \nthe law because the law is powerful; in fact, the law is powerful \nfor persons only because they obey it. We do not proceed \nthrough a traffic intersection because the signal changes, but \nwhen the signal changes. \nThis means that a peculiar burden falls on property owners. \nSince the laws protecting their property will be effective only \nwhen they are able to persuade others to obey those laws, \nthey must introduce a theatricality into their ownership suffi­\nciently engaging that their opponents will live by its script. \n38 \nThe theatricality of property has, in fact, an elaborate struc­\nture that property owners must be at considerable labor to \nsustain. If property is to be persuasively emblematic, that is, \nif it is to draw attention to the owner's titles in past victories, \na double burden falls on its owners: \nFirst, they must show that the amount of their property \ncorresponds to the difficulty they were under in winning title \nto it. Property must be seen as compensation . \nSecond, they must show that the type of their property \ncorresponds to the nature of the competition by which title \nto it was won. Property must be seen to be consumed. \n48\n\f\n39 \nProperty is appropriately compensatory whenever owners \ncan show that what is gained is no more than what was ex­\npended in the effort to acquire it. There must be an equiva­\nlency between what the owners have given of themselves and \nwhat they have received from others by way of their titles. \nWhoever is unable to show a correspondence between \nwealth and the risks undergone to acquire it, or the talents \nspent in its acquisition, will soon face a challenge over entitle­\nment. The rich are regularly subject to theft , to taxation, to \nthe expectation that their wealth be shared, as though what \nthey have is not true compensation and therefore not com­\npletely theirs. \nTo be fully compensated for what one gave of oneself in \nthe struggle for a title is to be restored to the condition one \nwas in prior to competition. \nProperty is an attempt to recover the past. It returns one \nto precompetitive status. One is compensated for the amount \nof time spent (and thus lost) in competition . \nThis attempt to recover the past is, however, a theatrical \nattempt which can succeed only to the degree that it is conspic­\nuous to its audience . Property must take up space. I t must \nbe somewhere-and somewhere obvious. That is, it must exist \nin such a form that others will come upon it and take notice \nof it. Our property must intrude on another , stand in another's \nway, causing one to contend with it. Propertied persons typi­\ncally have large estates and freedom of movement through \nthe society. At the same time , the property of the rich has \nthe effect of crowding and confining the less propertied . The \nvery poor are typically restricted to narrow geographical limits \nand are regarded as aliens outside them . \nWhat is at stake here for owners is not the amount of \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 49\n\f\nproperty as such, but its ability to draw an audience for whom \nit will be appropriately emblematc; that is, an audience who \nwill see it as just compensation for the effort and skill used \nin acquiring it. \n40 \nThere is a second theatrical requirement that falls on the \nowners of property . Once they have drawn attention to what \nthey have lost in acquiring what they own, they must then \nconsume what they have gained in a way that recovers the \nloss. The intuitive principle here is that we cannot be justified \nin owning what we do not need to use or plan to use. One \ndoes not earn money merely to store it away where it will \nbe protected from all possible future use. \nConsumption is to be understood as an intentional activity. \nOne does not consume property simply by destroying it­\nelse burning our earned money would suffice-but by using \nit up in a certain way. \nConsumption is a kind of activity that is directly opposite \nto the very form of engagement by which the title was won. \nIt must be the kind of activity that can convince all observers \nthat the possesser's title to it is no longer in question . \nThe more powerful we consider persons to be, the less \nwe expect them to do, for their power can come only from \nthat which they have done . After athletic contests in which \nmajor titles have been at stake, it is common for the audience \nto lift the winners to their shoulders, marching them about \nas if they were helpless-in the sharpest possible contrast to \nthe physical skill and energy they have just displayed. Mon-\n50\n\f\narchs and divinities are often borne on ceremonial transports; \nthe very wealthy are driven in carriages or limousines . \nConsumption is an activity so different from gainful labor \nthat it shows itself in the mode of leisure, even indolence. \nWe display the success of what we have done by not having \nto do anything . The more we use up, therefore, the more \nwe show ourselves to be winners of past contests. \"Conspicuous \nabstention from labour therefore becomes the conventional \nmark of superior pecuniary achievement and the conventional \nindex of reputability ; and conversely, since application to pro­\nductive labour is a mark of poverty and subjection , it becomes \ninconsistent with a reputable standing in the community \" \n(Veblen) . \nJust as compensation makes itself conspicuous by taking \nup space, consumption draws attention to itself by the length \nof time it continues. Property must not only intrude on others, \nit must continue to intrude on others . The amount of property \nwe have is measurable according to the length of time we \nremain conspicuous, requiring others to adjust their freedom \nof movement to our spatial dimensions . It is the common \ngoal of th e ;'ich to establish a mode of visibility that will \nextend itself over generations by executing wills that prevent \nthe rapid exhaustion of their fortune, by endowing societally \nimportant institutions , by erecting great buildings in their \nname . Persons of small victories, of lower rank, do not have \nproperty of great temporal value; what they have will be ex­\nhausted quickly. Those persons whose victories the society \nwishes never to forget are given prominent and eternal monu­\nments at the heart of its capital cities, often taking up consider­\nable space, diverting traffic, and standing in the path of casual \nstrollers. \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 51\n\f\nIt is apparent to infinite players that wealth is not so much \npossessed as it is performed . \n41 \nIf one of the reasons for uniting into commonwealths is \nthe protection of property, and if property is to be protected \nless by power as such than by theater, then societies become \nacutely dependent on their artists-what Plato called poietai: \nthe storytellers, the inventors, sculptors, poets, any original \nthinkers whatsoever. \nI t is certainly the case that no gentleman will find the \nArtful Dodger's hand in his pocket so long as it is in the \nforceful grip of an officer of the law. But any policy of forceful \nrestraint so extreme that it requires an officer for each potential \ncriminal is a formula for quick descent into social chaos. \nSome societies develop the belief that they can eliminate \nthievery by guaranteeing all their members, including thieves, \na certain amount of property-the impulse behind much social \nwelfare legislation. But putting a coin into the pocket of the \nArtful Dodger will hardly convince him that he is no longer \na legitimate contender for the coin in mine. \nThe more effective policy for a society is to find ways of \npersuading its thieves to abandon their role as competitors \nfor property for the sake of becoming audience to the theater \nof wealth. It is for this reason that societies fall back on the \nskill of those poietai who can theatricalize the property rela­\ntions, and indeed, all the inner structures of each society. \nSocietal theorists of any subtlety whatever know that such \ntheatricalization must be taken with great seriousness. With­\nout it there is no culture at all, and a society without culture \nwould be too drab and lifeless to be endured . What would \n52\n\f\nNazism have been without its musicians, graphic artists, and \nset designers, without its Albert Speer and Leni Riefenstahl? \nEven the rigid authoritarian shell of Plato's Republic will be \n\"filled with a multitude of things which are no longer necessi­\nties, as for example all kinds of hunte rs and artists, many of \nthem concerned with shapes and colors, many with music; \npoets and their auxiliaries, actors, choral dancers, and contrac­\ntors; and makers of all kinds of instruments , including those \nneeded for the beautification of women\" (Plato). \nIf wealth and might are to be performed , great wealth and \ngreat might must be performed brilliantly. \n42 \nWhile societal thinkers may not overlook the importance \nof poiesis, or creative activity, neither may they underestimate \nits danger, for the poietai are the ones most likely to remember \nwhat has been forgotten-that society is a species of culture . \nSocieties commonly treat their poietai with considerable \nambivalence. The governing bodies of the Soviet Union do \nnot believe that all genuine art must conform to the standards \nof socialist realism, but they do believe it is always possible \nto find true art that is compatibl~ with socialist realism; there ­\nfore, those artists whose works do not conform to that line \nmay be punished without affecting the integrit y of art as such. \nPlato did not expect his artists to compromise their art, but \nhe did say that there must be \" general lines which the poietai \nmust follow in their stories. These lines they will not be able \nto cross.\" \nThe deepest and most consequent struggle of each society \nis therefore not with other societies, but with the culture \nthat exists within itself-the culture that is itself. Conflict \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 53\n\f\nwith other societies is, in fact, an effective way for .a society \nto restrain its own culture. Powerful societies do not silence \ntheir poietai in order that they may go to war; they go to \nwar as a way of silencing their poietai . Original thinkers can \nbe suppressed through execution and exile, or they can be \nencouraged through subsidy and flattery to praise the society's \nheroes. Alexander and Napoleon took their poets and their \nscholars into battle with them, saving themselves the nuisance \nof repression and along the way drawing ever larger audiences \nto their triumph. \nAnother successful defense of society against the culture \nwithin itself is to give artists a place by regarding them as \nthe producers of property, thus elevating the value of consum­\ning art, or owning it. It is notable that very large collections \nof art, and all the world's major museums, are the work of \nthe very rich or of societies during strongly nationalistic peri­\nods. All the principal museums in New York, for example, \nare associated with the names of the famously rich: Carnegie, \nFrick, Rockefeller, Guggenheim, Whitney, Morgan, Lehman. \nSuch museums are not designed to protect the art from \npeople, but to protect the people from art. \n43 \nCulture is likely to break out in a society not when its \npoietai begin to voice a line contrary to that of the society, \nbut when they begin to ignore all lines whatsoever and concern \nthemselves with bringing the audience back into play-not \ncompetitive play, but play that affirms itself as play. \nWhat confounds a society is not serious opposition , but \nthe lack of seriousness altogether. Generals can more easily \n54\n\f\nsuffer attempts to oppose their warfare with poiesis than at­\ntempts to show warfare as poiesis. \nArt that is used against a society or its policies gives up \nits character as infinite play, and aims for an end . Such art \nis no less propaganda than that which praises its heroes with \nhigh seriousness. Once warfare, or any other societal activity, \nhas been taken into the infinite play of poiesis so that it \nappears to be either comical or pointless (in the way that, \nsay, beauty is pointless), there is an acute danger that the \nsoldiers will find no audience for their prizes, and therefore \nno reason to fight for them . \n44 \nSince culture is itself a poiesis, all of its participants are \npoietai-inventors, makers, artists, storytellers, mythologists . \nThey are not, however, makers of actualities, but makers of \npossibilities. The creativity of culture has no outcome, no \nconclusion. It does not result in art works, artifacts, products. \nCreativity is a continuity that engenders itself in others. \"Art­\nists do not create objects, but create by way of objects\" (Rank). \nArt is not art, therefore, except as it leads to an engendering \ncreativity in its beholders . Whoever takes possession of the \nobjects of art has not taken possession of the art. \nSince art is never possession, and always possibility, nothing \npossessed can have the status of art. If art cannot become \nproperty, property is never art-as property . Property draws \nattention to titles, points backward toward a finished time. \nArt is dramatic, opening always forward, beginning something \nthat cannot be finished. \nBecause it is not conclusive, but engendering, culture has \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 55\n\f\nno estal ~!shed catalogue of acceptable activities. We are not \nartists by reason of having mastered certain skills or exercising \nspecified techniques . Art has no scripted roles for its perform­\ners. It is precisely because it has none that it is art. Artistry \ncan be found anywhere; indeed, it can only be found anywhere. \nOne must be surprised by it. It cannot be looked for. We \ndo not watch artists to see what they do, but watch what \npersons do and discover the artistry in it. \nArtists cannot be trained . One does not become an artist \nby acquiring certain skills or techniques, though one can use \nany number of skills and techniques in artistic activity. The \ncreative is found in anyone who is prepared for surprise. Such \na person cannot go to school to be an artist, but can only \ngo to school as an artist. \nTherefore, poets do not \"fit\" into society, not because a \nplace is denied them but because they do not take their \n\"places\" seriously. They openly see its roles as theatrical, its \nstyles as poses, its clothing costumes, its rules conventional, \nits crises arranged, its conflicts performed, and its metaphysics \nideological. \n45 \nTo regard society as a species of culture is not to overthrow \nor even alter society, but only to eliminate its perceived neces­\nsity. Infinite players have rules; they just do not forget that \nrules are an expression of agreement and not a requirement \nfor agreement. \nCulture is not therefore mere disorder. Infinite players never \nunderstand their culture as the composite of all that they \nchoose individually to do, but as the congruence of all that \n56\n\f\nthey choose to do with each other. Because there is no congru­\nence without the decision to have one, all cultural congruence \nis under constant revision. No sooner did the Renaissance \nbegin than it began to change. Indeed, the Renaissance was \nnot something apart from its change; it was itself a certain \npersistent and congruent evolution. \nFor this reason it can be said that where a society is defined \nby its boundaries, a culture is defined by its horizon. \nA boundary is a phenomenon of opposition . It is the meeting \nplace of hostile forces. Where nothing opposes there can be \nno boundary. One cannot move beyond a boundary without \nbeing resisted. \nThis is why patriotism-that is, the desire to protect the \npower in a society by way of increasing the power of a society­\nis inherently belligerent. Since there can be no prizes without \na society, no society without opponents, patriots must create \nenemies before we can require protection from them . Patriots \ncan flourish only where boundaries are well-defined, hostile, \nand dangerous. The spirit of patriotism is therefore characteris­\ntically associated with the military or other modes of interna­\ntional conflict. \nBecause patriotism is the desire to contain all other finite \ngames within itself-that is, to embrace all horizons within \na single boundary-it is inherently evil. \nA horizon is a phenomenon of vision. One cannot look \nat the horizon; it is simply the point beyond which we cannot \nsee. There is nothing in the horizon itself, however, that limits \nvision, for the horizon opens onto all that lies beyond itself. \nWhat limits vision is rather the incompleteness of that vision. \nOne never reaches a horizon . It is not a line; it has no \nplace; it encloses no field; its location is always relative to \nthe view. To move toward a horizon is simply to have a new \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 57\n\f\nhorizon. One can therefore never be close to one's horizon , \nthough one may certainly have a short range of vision, a narrow \nhorizon. \nWe are never somewhere in relation to the horizon since \nthe horizon moves with our vision. We can only be somewhere \nby turning away from the horizon , by replacing vision with \nopposition, by declaring the place on which we stand to be \ntimeless-a sacred region, a holy land, a body of truth , a \ncode of inviolable commandments . To be somewhere is to \nabsolutize time , space, and number. \nEvery move an infinite player makes is toward the horizon . \nEvery move made by a finite player is within a bound ­\nary. Every moment of an infinite game therefore presents a \nnew vision, a new range of possibilities. The Renaissance, \nlike all genuine cultural phenomena, was not an effort to pro­\nmote one or another vision. It was an effort to find visions \nthat promised still more vision. \nWho lives horizon ally is never somewhere , but always in \npassage. \n46 \nSince culture is horizonal it is not restricted by time or \nspace. \nTo the degree that the Renaissance was true culture it \nhas not ended . Anyone may enter into its mode of renewing \nvision. This does not mean that we repeat what was done. \nTo enter a culture is not to do what the others do, but to \ndo whatever one does with the others . \nThis is why every new participant in a culture both enter s \ninto an existing context and simultaneously changes that con­\ntext. Each new speaker of its language both learns the language \n58\n\f\nand alters it. Each new adoption of a tradition makes it a \nnew tradition-just as the family into which a child is born \nexisted prior to that birth, but is nonetheless a new family \nafter the birth. \nThe reciprocity of this transformation has no respect to \ntime . The fact that the Renaissance began in the fourteenth \nor fifteenth century has nothing to do with its capacity for \nchanging our horizon. This reciprocity works backward as well \nas forward. Each person whose horizon is affected by the \nRenaissance affects the horizon of the Renaissance in turn. \nAny culture that continues to influence our vision continues \nto grow in the very exercise of that influence . \n47 \nSince a culture is not anything persons do, but anything \nthey do with each other, we may say that a culture comes \ninto being whenever persons choose to be a people. It is as \na people that they arrange their rules with each other, their \nmoralities, their modes of communication. \nProperly speaking, the Renaissance is not a period but a \npeople, moreover, a people without a boundary, and therefore \nwithout an enemy . The Renaissance is not against anyone. \nWhoever is not of the Renaissance cannot go out to oppose \nit, for they will find orily an invitation to join the people it \nIS. \nA culture is sometimes opposed by suppressing its ideas, \nits works, even its language . This is a common strategy of a \nsociety afraid of the culture growing within its boundaries . \nBut it is a strategy certain to fail, because it confuses the \ncreative activity (poiesis) with the product (poiema) of that \nactivity. \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 59\n\f\nSocieties characteristically separate the ideas from their \nthinkers, the poiema from its poietes. A society abstracts its \nthought and grants power to certain ideas as though they \nhad an existence of their own independent from those who \nthink them , even those who first produced them . In fact, a \nsociety is likely to have an idea of itself that no thinker may \nchallenge or revise. Abstracted thought-thought without a \nthinker-is metaphysics. A society's metaphysics is its ideol­\nogy: theories that present themselves as the product of these \npeople or those. The Renaissance had no ideology. \nInasmuch as it has no metaphysics, a people is not threat­\nened when its apparent society is threatened, or altered, or \neven destroyed. The manipulation of the government, the \nlaws, the enforcement functions of a state either by persons \nwithin the society (through usurpation or abuse of power) \nor by persons without (in other states) cannot in itself affect \nthe decision of a people to be a people. \nA people, as a people, has nothing to defend . In the same \nway a people has nothing and no one to attack . One cannot \nbe free by opposing another. My freedom does not depend \non your loss of freedom. On the contrary, since freedom is \nnever freedom from society, but freedom for it, my freedom \ninherently affirms yours. \nA people has no enemies. \n48 \nFor a bounded, metaphysically veiled, and destined society, \nenemies are necessary, conflict inevitable, and war likely. \nWar is not an act of unchecked ruthlessness but a declared \ncontest between bounded societies, or states. If a state has \nno enemies it has no boundaries. To keep its definitions clear \n60\n\f\na state must stimulate danger to itself. Under the constant \ndanger of war the people of a state are far more attentive \nand obedient to the finite structures of their society: \"just \nas the blowing of the winds preserves the sea from the foulness \nwhich would be the result of a prolonged calm, so also corrup­\ntion in nations would be the product of prolonged, let alone \n'perpetual' peace\" (Hegel). \nWar presents itself as necessary for self-protection, when \nin fact it is necessary for self-identification . \nIf it is the impulse of a finite player to go against another \nnation in war, it is the design of an infinite player to oppose \nwar within a nation . \nIf as a people infinite players cannot go to war against a \npeople, they can act against war itself within whatever state \nthey happen to reside. In one wa.y their opposition to war \nresembles that of finite players: Each is opposed to the exis­\ntence of a state . But their reasons and the strategies for at­\ntempting to eliminate states are radically different. Finite \nplayers go to war against states because they endanger bound­\naries; infinite players oppose states because they engender \nboundaries . \nThe strategy of finite players is to kill a state by killing \nthe people who invented it. Infinite players, however, under­\nstanding war to be a conflict between states, conclude that \nstates can have only states as enemies; they cannot have per­\nsons as enemies. \"Sometimes it is possible to kill a state without \nkilling a single one of its members; and war gives no right \nwhich is not necessary to the gaining of its object\" (Rousseau). \nFor infinite players, if it is possible to wage a war without \nkilling a single person, then it is possible to wage war only \nwithout killing a single person. \nFor infinite players the chief difficulty with finite players' \ncommitment to war is not, however, that persons are killed. \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 61\n\f\nIndeed, finite players themselves often genuinely regret this \nand do as little killing as possible. The difficulty is that such \nwarfare has in it the contradiction of all finite play. Winning \na war can be as destructive as losing one, for if boundaries \nlose their clarity, as they do in a decisive victory, the state \nloses its identity. Just as Alexander wept upon learning he \nhad no more enemies to conquer, finite players come to rue \ntheir victories unless they see them quickly challenged by new \ndanger. A war fought to end all wars, in the strategy of finite \nplay, only breeds universal warfare. \nThe strategy of infinite players is horizonal. They do not \ngo to meet putative enemies with power and violence, but \nwith poiesis and vision. They invite them to become a people \nin passage. Infinite players do not rise to meet arms with \narms; instead, they make use of laughter, vision, and surprise \nto engage the state and put its boundaries back into play. \nWhat will undo any boundary is the awareness that it is \nour vision, and not what we are viewing, that is limited . \n49 \nPlato suggested that some of the poets be driven out of \nthe Republic because they had the power to weaken the guard­\nians. Poets can make it impossible to have a war-unless they \ntell stories that agree with the \"general line\" established by \nthe state . Poets who have no metaphysics, and therefore no \npolitical line, make war impossible because they have the irre­\nsistible ability to show the guardians that what seems necessary \nis only possible. \nThe danger of the poets, for Plato, is that they can imitate \nso well that it is difficult to see what is true and what is \n6Z\n\f\nmerely invented . Since reality cannot be invented, but only \ndiscovered through the exercise of reason-according to \nPlato-all poets must be put into the service of reason. The \npoets are to surround the citizens of the Republic with such \nart as will \"lead them unawares from childhood to love of, \nresemblance to, and harmon y with , the beauty of reason.\" \nThe use of the word \"unawares\" shows Plato's intention \nto keep the metaphysical veil intact. Those who are being \nled to reason cannot be aware of it. They must be led to it \nwithout choosing it. Plato asks his poets not to create, but \nto deceive. \nTrue poets lead no one unawares. It is nothing other than \nawareness that poets-that is, creators of all sorts-seek . They \ndo not display their art so as to make it appear real; they \ndisplay the real in a way that reveals it to be art. \nWe must remind ourselves, to be sure, that Plato was him­\nself an artist, a poietes. His Republic was an invention . So \nwere the theory of forms and the idea of the Good. Since \nall veiling is self-veiling, we cannot help but think that behind \nthe rational metaphysician, philosophy's great Master Player, \nstood Plato the poet, fully aware that the entire opus was \nan act of play, an invitation to readers not to reproduce the \ntruth but to take his inventions into their own play, establish­\ning the continuity of his art by changing it. \n50 \nWe can find metaphysicians thinking, but we cannot find \nmetaphysicians in their thinking . When we separate the meta­\nphysics from the thinker we have an abstraction, the deathless \nshadow of a once living act. It is no longer what someone \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 63\n\f\nis saying but what someone has said. When metaphysics is \nmost successful on its own terms, it leaves its listeners in \nsilence, certainly not in laughter. \nMetaphysics is about the real but is abstract. Poetry is the \nmaking (poiesis) of the real and is concrete . Whenever what \nis made (poiema) is separated from the maker (poietes), it \nbecomes metaphysical. As it stands there , and as the voice \nof the poietes is no longer listened to, the poiema is an object \nto be studied , not an act to be learned . One cannot learn' \nan object, but only the poiesis, or the act of creating objects. \nTo separate the poiema from poiesis, the created object from \nthe creative act, is the essence of the theatrical. \nPoets cannot kill; they die. Metaphysics cannot die; it kills. \n64"

    "raw_text": "by releasing it to others . The sounds of the words you speak \nmay lie on your own lips, but if you do not relinquish them \nentirely to a listener they never become words, and you say \nnothing at all. The words die with the sound. Spoken to me, \nyour words become mine to do with as I please. As the genius \nof your words, you lose all authority over them . So too with \nthoughts. However you consider them your own, you cannot \nthink the thoughts themselves, but only what they are about. \nYou cannot think thoughts any more than you can act actions. \nIf you do not truly speak the words that reside entirely in \ntheir own sound, neither can you think that which remains \nthought or can be translated back into thought. In thinking \nyou cast thoughts beyond themselves, surrendering them to \nthat which they cannot be. \nThe paradox of genius exposes us directly to the dynamic \nof open reciprocity, for if you are the genius of what you \nsay to me, I am the genius of what I hear you say. What \nyou say originally I can hear only originally. As you surrender \nthe sound on your lips, I surrender the sound in my ear. \nEach of us has relinquished to the other what has been relin­\nquished to the other. \nThis does not mean that speech has come to nothing . On \nthe contrary, it has become speech that invites speech. When \nthe genius of speech is abandoned, words are said not originally \nbut repetitively . To repeat words, even our own, is to contain \nthem in their own sound. Veiled speech is that spoken as \nthough we have forgotten we are its originators. \nTo speak, or act, or think originally is to erase the boundary \nof the self. It is to leave behind the territorial personality. \nA genius does not have a mind full of thoughts but is the \nthinker of thoughts , and is the center of a field of vision. It \nis a field of vision, however, that is recognized as a field of \n68\n\f\nvIsion only when we see that it includes within itself the \noriginal centers of other fields of vision. \nThis does not mean that I can see what you see. On the \ncontrary, it is because I cannot see what you see that I can \nsee at all. The discovery that you are the unrepeatable center \nof your own vision is simultaneous with the discovery that I \nam the center of my own. \n52 \nAs the geniuses we are, we do not look but see. \nTo look at something is to look at it within its limitations . \nI look at what is marked off, at what stands apart from other \nthings. But things do not have their own limitations . Nothing \nlimits itself. The sea gulls circling on the invisible currents , \nthe cat on my desk, the siren of a distant ambulance are \nnot somehow distinct from the environment; they are the \nenvironment. To look at them I must look for what I take \nthem to be. I was not looking at the sea gulls as though it \nwas the sea gulls who happened to be there-I was looking \nfor something to make this example. I might have seen them \nas a sign that land is not far, or that the sea is not far; I \ncould have been looking for a form to reproduce on a canvas \nor in a poem. To look at is to look for. It is to bring the \nlimitations with us. \"Nature has no outline . Imagination has\" \n(Blake). \nIf to look is to look at what is contained within its limita­\ntions, to see is to see the limitations themselves. Each new \nschool of painting is new not because it now contains subject \nmatter ignored in earlier work, but because it sees the limita­\ntions previous artists imposed on their subject matter but could \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 69\n\f\nnot see themselves . The earlier artists worked within the out­\nlines they imagined ; the later reworked their imaginations . \nTo look is a territorial activity . It is to observe one thing \nafter another within a bounded space-as though in time it \ncan all be seen. Academic fields are such territories. Sometimes \neverything in a field finally does get looked at and defined­\nthat is, placed in its proper location . Mechanics and rhetoric \nare such fields. Physics may prove to be. Biological mysteries \nfall away at an astonishing rate . It becomes increasingly diffi­\ncult to find something new to look at. \nWhen we pass from looking to seeing, we do not therefore \nlose our sight of the objects observed . Seeing, in fact, does \nnot disturb our looking at all. It rather places us in that territory \nas its genius, aware that our imagination does not create within \nits outlines but creates the outlines themselves . The physicist \nwho sees speaks physics with us, inviting us to see that the \nthings we thought were there are not things at all. By learning \nnew limitations from such a person, we learn not only what \nto look for with them but also how to see the way we use \nlimitations. A physics so taught becomes poiesis. \n53 \nTo be the genius of myself is not to bring myself into \nbeing. As the origin of myself I am not also the cause of \nmyself, as though I were the product of my own action . But \nthen neither am I the product of any other action . My parents \nmay have wanted a child, but they could not have wanted \nme. \nI am both the outcome of my past and the transformation \nof my past. To be related to the past as its outcome is to \nstand in causal continuity with it. Such a relation can be \n70\n\f\naccounted for in scientific explanation. I can be said to be \nthe result of precise genetic influence. The date and place \nof my birth are matters of causal necessity; I had no part in \ndeciding either. Neither could anyone else have chosen them . \nMy birth, when understood in terms of causal continuity, \nmarks no absolute beginning . It marks nothing at all except \nan arbitrary point in an unbroken process. Causally speaking, \nthere is nothing new here, only the kinds of change that \nconform to the known laws of nature . \nSpeaking in purely causal terms, I cannot say I was born; \nI should say rather that I have emerged as a phase in the \nprocess of reproduction . A reproduction is a repetition, a recur­\nrence of that which has been . Birth, on the other hand, in \ncausal terms, is all discontinuity . It has its beginning in itself, \nand can be caused by nothing . It makes no sense to say, \"I \nwas reproduced on this date and in this place.\" To say \" I \nwas born\" is to speak of myself as having an uncaused point \nof departure within the realm of the continuous, an absolute \nbeginning not comprehensible to the explanatory intelligence. \nAs such a phenomenon birth repeats nothing; it is not the \noutcome of the past but the recasting of a drama already \nunder way. A birth is an event in the ongoing history of a \nfamily, even the history of a culture . The radical originality \nof a birth announces itself in the way it brings the dramatic \ninto conflict with the theatrical in cultural or family history . \nTheatrically, my birth is an e~ent of plotted repetition . I \nam born as another member of my family and my culture. \nWho I am is a question already answered by the content \nand character of a tradition . Dramatically, my birth is the \nrupture of that repetitive sequence, an event certain to change \nwhat the past has meant. In this case the character of a tradi­\ntion is determined by who I am . Dramatically speaking, every \nbirth is the birth of genius. \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 71\n\f\nThe drama under way at the time of my birth is moved \nforward to new possibilities by the appearance of a new genius \nwithin it. It is a drama , however, already peopled by finite \nplayers attempting to forget, playing for keeps. If I am born \ninto, and add to, the culture of a family, I am also a product \nand a citizen of its politics. I first experience the conflict \nbetween the theatrical and the dramatic in the felt pressure \nto take up one of the roles prepared for me: eldest son, favorite \ndaughter , heir to the family's honor, avenger of its losses. \nEach of these roles comes, of course, with a script, one \nwhose lines a person might easily spend a lifetime repeating , \nwhile intentionally forgetting , or repressing, the fact that it \nis but a learned script. Such a person \"is obliged to repeat \nthe repressed material as a contemporary experience instead \nof, as the physician would prefer to see, remembering it as \nsomething belonging to the past\" (Freud). It is the genius \nin us who knows that the past is most definitely past, and \ntherefore not forever sealed but forever open to creative rein­\nterpretation . \n54 \nNot allowing the past to be past may be the primary source \nfor the seriousness of finite players. Inasmuch as finite play \nalways has its audience , it is the audience to whom the finite \nplayer intends to be known as winner . The finite player, in \nother words, must not only have an audience but must have \nan audience to convince. \nJust as the titles of winners are worthless unless they are \nvisible to others , there is a kind of antititle that attaches to \ninvisibility. To the degree that we are invisible we have a \npast that has condemned us to oblivion. It is as though we \n72\n\f\nhave somehow been overlooked, even forgotten, by our chosen \naudience . If it is the winners who are presently visible, it is \nthe losers who are invisibly past. \nAs we enter into finite play-not playfully, but seriously­\nwe come before an audience conscious that we bear the antiti­\ntles of invisibility. We feel the need, therefore, to prove to \nthem that we are not what we think they think we are or, \nmore precisely, that we were not who we think the audience \nthinks we were. \nAs with all finite play, an acute contradiction quickly devel­\nops at the heart of this attempt. As finite players we will \nnot enter the game with sufficient desire to win unless we \nare ourselves convinced by the very audience we intend to \nconvince. That is, unless we believe we actually are the losers \nthe audience sees us to be, we will not have the necessary \ndesire to win. The more negatively we assess ourselves, the \nmore we strive to reverse the negative judgment of others. \nThe outcome brings the contradiction to perfection: by prov­\ning to the audience they were wrong, we prove to ourselves \nthe audience was right. \nThe more we are recognized as winners, the more we know \nourselves to be losers. That is why it is rare for the winners \nof highly coveted and publicized prizes to settle for their titles \nand retire. Winners, especially celebrated winners, must prove \nrepeatedly they are winners. The script must be played over \nand over again. Titles must be defended by new contests. \nNo one is ever wealthy enough, honored enough, applauded \nenough. On the contrary, the visibility of our victories only \ntightens the grip of the failures in our invisible past. \nSo crucial is this power of the past to finite play that we \nmust find ways of remembering that we have been forgotten \nto sustain our interest in the struggle. There is a humiliating \nmemory at the bottom of all serious conflicts. \"Remember \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 73"

    "raw_text": "the Alamo!\" \"Remember the Maine!\" \"Remember Pearl Har­\nbor!\" These are the cries that carried Americans into several \nwars. Having once been insulted by Athens, the great Persian \nEmperor Darius renewed his appetite for war by having a \npage follow him about to whisper in his ear, \"Sire, remember \nthe Athenians.\" \nIndeed, it is only by remembering what we have forgotten \nthat we can enter into competition with sufficient intensity \nto be able to forget we have forgotten the character of all \nplay: Whoever must play cannot play. \nWhenever we act as the genius of ourselves, it will be in \nthe spirit of allowing the past to be past. I t is the genius in \nus who is capable of ridding us of resentment by exercising \nwhat Nietzsche called the \"faculty of oblivion,\" not as a way \nof denying the past but as a way of reshaping it through \nour own originality . Then we forget that we have been forgot­\nten by an audience, and remember that we have forgotten \nour freedom to play. \n55 \nIf in the culture into which we are born there are always \npersons who will urge us to theatricalize our lives by supplying \nus with a repeatable past, there will also be persons (possibly \nthe same ones) in whose presence we learn to prepare ourselves \nfor surprise. It is in the presence of such persons that we \nfirst recognize ourselves as the geniuses we are. \nThese persons do not give us our genius or produce it in \nus. In no way is the source of genius external to itself; never \nis a child moved to genius. Genius arises with touch. Touch \n74\n\f\nis a characteristically paradoxical phenomenon of infinite play. \nI am not touched by an other when the distance between \nus is reduced to zero. I am touched only if I respond from \nmy own center-that is, spontaneously, originally. But you \ndo not touch me except from your own center, out of your \nown genius. Touching is always reciprocal. You cannot touch \nme unless I touch you in response. \nThe opposite of touching is moving. You move me by press­\ning me from without toward a place you have already foreseen \nand perhaps prepared . It is a staged action that succeeds only \nif in moving me you remain unmoved yourself. I can be moved \nto tears by skilled performances and heart-rending newspaper \naccounts, or moved to passion by political manifestos and \nnarratives of heroic achievement-but in each case I am \nmoved according to a formula or design to which the actor \nor agent is immune . When actors bring themselves to tears \nby their performance, and not as their performance, they \nhave failed their craft; they have become theatrically inept. \nThis means that we can be moved only by persons who \nare not what they are; we can be moved only when we are \nnot who we are, but are what we cannot be. \nWhen I am touched, I am touched only as the person I \nam behind all the theatrical masks, but at the same time I \nam changed from within-and whoever touches me is touched \nas well. We do not touch by design. Indeed, all designs are \nshattered by touching . Whoever touches and whoever is \ntouched cannot but be surprised. (The unpredictability of this \nphenomenon is reflected in our reference to the insane as \n\"touched . \") \nWe can be moved only by way of our veils. We are touched \nthrough our veils. \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 75\n\f\n56 \nThe character of touching can be seen quite clearly in the \nway infinite players understand both healing and sexuality. \nIf to be touched is to respond from one's center, it is also \nto respond as a whole person. To be whole is to be hale, or \nhealthy. In sum, whoever is touched is healed. \nThe finite player's interest is not in being healed, or made \nwhole, but in being cured, or made functional. Healing restores \nme to play, curing restores me to competition in one or another \ngame. \nPhysicians who cure must abstract persons into functions . \nThey -treat the illness, not the person. And persons willfully \npresent themselves as functions . Indeed, what sustains the \nenormous size and cost of the curing professions is the wide­\nspread desire to see oneself as a function, or a collection of \nfunctions. To be ill is to be dysfunctional; to be dysfunctional \nis to be unable to cbmpete in one's preferred contests. It is \na kind of death, an inability to acquire titles. The ill become \ninvisible. Illness always has the smell of death about it: Either \nit may lead to death, or it leads to the death of a person as \ncompetitor. The dread of illness is the dread of losing. \nOne is never ill in general. One is always ill with relation \nto some bounded activity. It is not cancer that makes me \nill. I t is because I cannot work, or run, or swallow that I \nam ill with cancer. The loss of function, the obstruction of \nan activity, cannot in itself destroy my health . I am too heavy \nto fly by flapping my arms, but I do not for that reason com­\nplain of being sick with weight. However, if I desired to be \na fashion model, a dancer, or a jockey, I would consider exces­\nsive weight to be a kind of disease and would be likely to \nconsult a doctor, a nutritionist, or another specialist to be \ncured of it. \n76\n\f\nWhen I am healed I am restored to my center in -a way \nthat my freedom as a person is not compromised by my loss \nof functions. This means that the illness need not be elimi­\nnated before I can be healed . I am not free to the degree \nthat I can overcome my infirmities, but only to the degree \nthat I can put my infirmities into play. I am cured of my \nillness; I am healed with my illness. \nHealing, of course, has all the reciprocity of touching . Just \nas I cannot touch myself, I cannot heal myself. But healing \nrequires no specialists, only those who can come to us out \nof their own center, and who are prepared to be healed them ­\nselves. \n57 \nSexuality for the infinite player is entirely a matter of touch . \nOne cannot touch without touching sexually. \nBecause sexuality is a drama of origins, it gives full expression \nto the genius you are and to the genius of others who partici­\npate in that drama . This throws a high challenge before the \npolitical ideologue. Aware that genuine sexual expression is \nat least as dangerous to society as genuine artistic expression, \nthe sexual metaphysician can appeal to at least two powerful \nsolutions. One is to treat sexuality as a process of reproduction; \nanother is to place it in the area of feeling and behavior. \nAlthough reproduction is a process that operates by way \nof our bodies, it nonetheless operates autonomously. Like every \nother natural process it is a phenomenon of causal continuity, \nhaving no inherent beginning or end . Therefore we cannot \nbe said to initiate the process by any act of our own. We \ncan only be carried along by it, inasmuch as conception occurs \nonly when all the necessary conditions have been met by the \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 77\n\f\nparenting couple. No one conceives a child; a child is conceived \nin the conjunction of sperm and ovum. The mother does \nnot give birth to a child; the mother is where the birth occurs. \nThe metaphysics of sexuality, applying to this solution, can \ntherefore draw a boundary line around sexual activity tha t \nleaves the genius of parenting altogether outside it. Thus the \nfamiliar view of some Christian theologians who say that the \nonly end of the sexual act is procreation . But this metaphysics, \ncommitted as it is to the continuity of the process, also leaves \nthe genius of the child entirely outside it. Thus the familiar \nview of theologians who say that the end of childbirth is to \nprovide citizens for the kingdom of God . Metaphysicall y un­\nderstood, sexuality has nothing to do with our existence as \npersons, for it views persons as expressions of sexuality, and \nnot sexuality as the expression of persons. \nThe second way of veiling genuine sexuality is to regard \nit as a feeling or as a kind of behavior . In either case it has \nthe character of something under observation . Even if it is \nour own sexuality we are concerned with , we can still look \non it from without, making an assessment of it as though it \nwere of another person. We ask ourselves and each othe r \nwhether certain behavior is acceptable or desirable; we are \npuzzled over the proper response to sexual feelings--ours or \nanother 's. Sexuality can in this way be dealt with as a societal \nphenomenon , regulated and managed according to the prevail­\ning ideology. Sexual rebels, violators of the sexual taboos, do \nnot weaken this ideology but affirm it as the rules of finite \nplay. \nIt is convenient to think that sexual misfits violate rules. \nThe matter is subtler by far. They are not concerned to oppose \nthe rules themselves but to engage in competiti ve struggle \nby way of those rules. Sexual attracti veness, or sexiness, is \neffective only to the degree that someone is offended by it. \n78\n\f\nPornography is exciting only so far as it reveals something \nforbidden, something otherwise unseeable . Thus the manda­\ntory hostility in it, the quality of shock and violence . \nBecause sexuality is so rich in the mystery of origin, it \nbecomes a region of human action deeply shaped by resent­\nment, where participants play out a manifold strategy of hostile \nencounters . The players in finite sexuality not only require \nthe offended resistance of those who refuse to join them in \ntheir play, they require the resistance of those who do join \nthem . \nSexual plotting on the part of one player is in fact stimulated \nby disinterest or fear or loathing on the part of the other. \nA Master Player of finite sexuality chooses not to take these \nattitudes as a way of refusing the sexual game, but takes them \nto be part of the game . Thus my indifference or revulsion \nto your sexuality becomes in your masterful playa sexual indif­\nference, a sexual revulsion. Suddenly I am no longer indifferent \nto your game, but indifferent to you within your game, and \nhave ipso facto made myself your opponent. This is the plot \nof the classical pulp novel and of Hollywood romance : indiffer­\nent girl won by ardent boy. \nThe profound seriousness of such sexual play is seen in \nthe unique nature of the prize that goes to the winner. What \none wants in the sexual contest is not just to have defeated \nthe other , but to have the defeated other. Sexuality is the \nonly finite game in which the winner's prize is the defeated \nopponent. \nSexual titles, like all other titles, have appropriately conspicu­\nous emblems . However, only in sexuality do persons themselves \nbecome property . In slavery or wage labor what we possess \nis not the persons of the slaves or the workers, but the products \nof their labors. In this case, to use Marx's phrase, persons \nare abstracted from their labor. But in sexuality persons are \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 79\n\f\nabstracted from themselves. The seduced opponent is so dis­\nplayed as to draw public attention to the seducer's triumph . \nIn the complex plotting of sexual encounter it is by no means \nuncommon for the partners to have played a double game \nin which each is winner and loser, and each is an emblem \nfor the other's seductive power. \nA society shows its mastery in the management of sexuality \nnot when it sets out unambiguous standards for sexual behavior \nor prescribed attitudes toward sexual feelings, but when it \ninstitutionalizes the emblematic display of sexual conquest. \nThese institutions can be as varied as burning widows alive \non the funeral pyres of their husbands or requiring the high \nvisibility of a spouse at an elected official's inauguration . \nFinite sexuality is a form of theater in which the distance \nbetween persons is regularly reduced to zero but in which \nneither touches the other. \n58 \nInsofar as sexuality is a drama of origin it is original to \nsociety and not derivative of it. It is therefore somewhat mis­\nleading to describe society as a regulator of finite sexual play. \nIt is more the case that finite sexuality shapes society than \nis shaped by it. Only to a limited extent do we take on the \nsexual roles assigned us by society. Much more frequently \nwe enter into societal arrangements by way of sexual roles. \n(For example, we are more likely to refer to the king as the \nfather of the country than we are to refer to the father as \nking of the family.) While society does serve a regulatory \nfunction, it is probably more correctly understood as sexuality \nmaking use of society to regulate itself. \nThis means that society plays little or no role in either \n80\n\f\ncausing or preventing sexual tensions. On the contrary, society \nabsorbs sexual tensions into all of its structures. It becomes \nthe larger theater for playing out the patterns of resentment \nlearned in the family. Society is where we prove to parents \nqua audience that we are not what we thought they thought \nwe were. Since the emphasis in this relationship is not on \nwhat our parents thought of us but on what we thought they \nthought, they become an audience that easily survives their \nphysical absence or death . Moreover, for the same reason \nthey become an audience whose definitive approval we can \nnever win. \nTo use Freud's famous phrase, the civilized are, therefore, \nthe discontent. We do not become losers in civilization but \nbecome civilized as losers. The collective result of this ineradi­\ncable sense of failure is that civilizations take on the spirit \nof resentment. Acutely sensitive to an imagined audience, \nthey are easily offended by other civilizations. Indeed, even \nthe most powerful societies can be embarrassed by the weak­\nest: the Soviet Union by Afghanistan, Great Britain by Argen­\ntina, the United States by Grenada. \nThis is also why the only true revolutionary act is not the \noverthrow of the father by the son-which only reinforces \nthe existing patterns of resentment-but the restoration of \ngenius to sexuality. It is by no means an accident that the \nonly successful attempt of the American citizenry to force \nthe ending of a foreign war occurred simultaneously with a \nwide revision in sexual attitudes . The civilization quickly recov­\nered from this threat, however, by tempting these revolutionar­\nies into a new sexual politics, one of societal standoff, where \nsexual genius is confused with such struggles as the passage \nof the Equal Rights Amendment and the election of women \nto national office. \nThere is one other way in which society is shaped by the \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 81\n\f\ntensions of finite sexuality: in its orientation toward property . \nSince sexuality is the only finite game in which the winner's \nprize is the loser, the most desirable form of property is the \npublicly acknowledged possession of another's person, a rela­\ntionship to which the possessed must of course freely consent. \nAll other forms of property are considerably less desirable, \neven when they are vast in quantity . The true value of my \nproperty, in fact, varies not with its monetary worth but with \nits effectiveness in winning for me the declaration that I am \nthe Master Player in our game with each other. \nThe most serious struggles are those for sexual property . \nFor this wars are fought, lives are generously risked, great \nschemes are initiated . However, who wins empire , fortune , \nand fame but loses in love has lost in everything. \n59 \nBecause finite, or veiled, sexuality is one or another struggle \nwhich its participants mean to win, it is oriented toward mo­\nments , outcomes, final scenes. Like all finite play it proceeds \nlargely by deception . Sexual desires are usually not directly \nannounced but concealed under a series of feints, gestures, \nstyles of dress, and showy behavior. Seductions are staged, \nscripted, costumed. Certain responses are sought, plots are \ndeveloped. In skillful seductions delays are employed, special \ncircumstances and settings are arranged . \nSeductions are designed to come to an end. Time runs \nout. The play is finished. All that remains is recollection, the \nmemory of a moment, and perhaps a longing for its repetition . \nSeductions cannot be repeated . Once one has won or lost \nin a particular finite game, the game cannot be played over. \n82\n\f\nMoments once reached cannot be reached again. Lovers often \nsustain vivid reminders of extraordinary moments, but they \nare reminded at the same time of their impotence in recreating \nthem . The appetite for novelty in lovemaking-new positions, \nthe use of drugs, exotic surroundings , additional partners­\nis only a search for new moments that can live on only in \nrecollection. \nAs with all finite play, the goal of veiled sexuality is to \nbring itself to an end . \n60 \nBy contrast, infinite players have no interest in seduction \nor in restricting the freedom of another to one's own bound­\naries of play. Infinite players recognize choice in all aspects \nof sexuality. They may see in themsel ves and in others, for \nexample, the infant's desire to compete for the mother, but \nthey also see that there is neither physiological nor societal \ndestiny in sexual !,atterns. Who chooses. to compete with an­\nother can also choose to play with another. \nSexuality is not a bounded phenomenon but a horizonal \nphenomenon for infinite players. One can never say, therefore , \nthat an infinite player is homosexual, or heterosexual, or celi­\nbate, or adulterous, or faithful-because each of these defini­\ntions has to do with boundaries, with circumscribed areas \nand styles of play. Infinite players do not play within sexual \nboundaries, but with sexual boundaries . They are concerned \nnot with power but with vision. \nIn their sexual play they suffer others, allow them to be \nas they are. Suffering others , they open themselves. Open, \nthey learn both about others and about themselves. Learning, \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 83"

    "raw_text": "FOUR \nA FINITE GAME \nOCCURS WITHIN \nA WORLD\n\f\n\n\f\n63 \nA FINITE GAME occurs within a world. The fact that it must \nbe limited temporally, numerically, and spatially means that \nthere is something against which the limits stand. There is \nan outside to every finite game. Its limits are meaningless \nunless there is something to be limited, unless there is a larger \nspace, a longer time, a greater number of possible competitors . \nThere is nothing about a finite game, in itself, that deter­\nmines at what time it is to be played, or by whom , or where. \nThe rules of a finite game will indicate the temporal, spatial, \nand numerical nature of the game itself; that, for example, \nit will last sixty minutes, will be played on a field 100 yards \nin length, and by two teams of eleven players each. But the \nrules do not, and cannot, determine the date, the location, \nand the specific participants. There is nothing in the rules \nthat requires professional teams composed of certain persons, \nearning salaries of specified amounts, joining at the end of \neach season in a national championship . The rules for the \npractice of medicine or for the exercise of the office of the \nBishop of Rome do not indicate which persons are to enter \nthese games; which kinds of persons, yes, but never the names \nof anyone. \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 89\n\f\nA world provides an absolute reference without which the \ntime, place, and participants make no sense. \nWhatever occurs within a game is relatively intelligible with \nreference to whatever else has happened inside its boundarie s, \nbut it is absolutely intelligible with reference to that world \nfor the sake of which its boundaries exist. \nIt is relatively intelligible to have won an election for the \npresidency by a few thousand votes after a campaign of about \nten months; it is absolutely intelligible to be the sixteenth \nPresident of the United States , a society unambiguously \nmarked off from all the rest of the world by its declared bound­\naries, in the 1,860th year of that world's history. \nWe cannot have a precise understanding of what it means \nto be the winner of a contest until we can place the game \nin the absolute dimensions of a world. \n64 \nWorld exists in the form of audience . A world is not all that \nis the case, but that which determines all that is the case. \nAn audience consists of persons observing a contest without \nparticipating in it. \nNo one determines who an audience will be. No exercise \nof power can make a world. A world must be its own spontan e­\nous source. \"A world worlds\" (Heidegger) . Who must be a \nworld cannot be a world. \nThe number of persons who join an audience is irrelevant. \nSo is the time and space in which an audience occurs. The \ntemporal and spatial boundaries of a finite game must be \nabsolute-in relation to an audience or a world. But when \nand where a world occurs, and whom it includes, is of no \nimportance. One does not say, \" I was in the world, or audience, \n90\n\f\non November 22, 1963,\" but rather, \"I was just getting out \nof the car thinking about what to cook for dinner when I \nheard that the President had been shot.\" An audience does \nnot receive its identity according to the persons within it, \nbut according to the events it observes. Those who remember \nthat day remember precisely what they were doing in the \nearly afternoon of that day, not because it was the 22d of \nNovember , but because it was at that moment that they be­\ncame audience to the events of that day. \nIf the boundaries of an audience are irrelevant , what is \nrelevant is the unity of the audience . They must be a singular \nentity , bound in their desire to see who will win the contest \nbefore them . Anyone for whom this desire is not primary is \nnot in the audience for that contest , and is not a person in \nthat world. \nThe fact that a finite game needs an audience before which \nit can be played, and the fact that an audience needs to be \nsingularly absorbed in the events before it, show the crucial \nreciprocity of finite play and the world. Finite players need \nthe world to provide an absolute reference for understanding \nthemselves; simultaneously, the world needs the theater of \nfinite play to remain a world. George Eliot's villainous charac­\nter, Grandcourt, \"did not care a languid curse for anyone's \nadmiration ; but this state of non-caring, just as much as desire, \nrequired its related object-namely, a world of admiring and \nenvying spectators : for if you are fond of looking stonily at \nsmiling persons, the persons must be there and they must \nsmile.\" \nWeare players in search of a world as often as we are \nworld in search of players, and sometimes we are both at \nonce. Some worlds pass quickly into existence, and quickly \nout of it. Some sustain themselves for longer periods, but \nno world lasts forever. \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 91\n\f\n65 \nThere is an indefinite number of worlds. \n66 \nThe reciprocity of game and world has another, deeper \neffect on the persons involved. Because the seriousness of \nfinite play derives from the players' need to correct another 's \nputative assessment of themselves, there is no requirement \nthat the audience be physically present, since players are al­\nready their own audience. Just as in finite sexuality where \nthe absence or death of parents has no effect on the child's \ndetermination to prove them wrong, finite players become \ntheir own hostile observers in the very act of competing . \nI cannot be a finite player without being divided against \nmyself. \nA similar dynamic is found in the audience . When suffi­\nciently oblivious to their status as audience, the observers of \na finite game become so absorbed in its conduct that they \nlose the sense of distance between themselves and the players. \nIt is they, quite as much as the players, who win or lose. \nFor this reason the audience absorbs in itself the same politics \nof resentment that moves players to show they are not what \nthey think others think they are. The audience is under the \nsame constraint to disprove this judgment. \nWhen we ask where an audience will find its own audience, \nwe discover the division inherent in all audiences. Each side \nof a conflict comes with its own partisan observers. Inasmuch \nas the conflict is expressed within the bounded playing of a \n92\n\f\ngame, the audience is unified-but its unity consists in its \nopposition to itself. \nWe cannot become a world without being divided against \nourselves. \n67 \nOccurring before a world, theatrically, a finite game occurs \nwithin time. Because it has its boundaries, its beginning and \nend, within the absolute temporal limits established by a world, \ntime for a finite player runs out; it is used up. It is a diminishing \nquantity . \nA finite game does not have its own time. It exists in a \nworld's time . An audience allows players only so much time \nto win their titles. \nEarly in a game time seems abundant, and there appears \na greater freedom to develop future strategies. Late in a game, \ntime is rapidly being consumed . As choices become more lim­\nited they become more important. Errors are more disastrous. \nWe look on childhood and youth as those \"times of life\" \nrich with possibility only because there still seem to remain \nso many paths open to a successful outcome . Each year that \npasses, however, increases the competitive value of making \nstrategically correct decisions. The errors of childhood can \nbe more easily amended than those of adulthood. \nFor the finite player in us freedom is a function of time. \nWe must have time to be free. \nThe passage of time is always relative to that which does \nnot pass, to the timeless. Victories occur in time, but the \ntitles won in them are timeless. Titles neither age nor die. \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 93"

The lapse of \ntime between the opening and closing of an era is a scene \nbetween curtains . It is not a time lived, but a time viewed­\nby both players and audience . The periodization of time pre­\nsupposes a viewer existing outside the boundaries of play, able \nto see the beginning and the end simultaneously. \nThe outcome of a finite game is the past waiting to happen . \nWhoever plays toward a certain outcome desires a particular \npast. By competing for a future prize, finite players compete \nfor a prized past. \n68 \nThe infinite player in us does not consume time but gener­\nates it. Because infinite play is dramatic and has no scripted \nconclusion, its time is time lived and not time viewed. \nAs an infinite player one is neither young nor old, for one \ndoes not live in the time of another. There is therefore no \nexternal measure of an infinite player's temporality . Time does \nnot pass for an infinite player. Each moment of time is a \nbeginning. \nEach moment is not the beginning of a period of time. \nIt is the beginning of an event that gives the time within it \nits specific quality. For an infinite player there is no such \nthing as an hour of time . There can be an hour of love, or \na day of grieving, or a season of learning, or a period of labor. \nAn infinite player does not begin working for the purpose \n94\n\f\nof filling up a period of time with work, but for the purpose \nof filling work with time. Work is not an infinite player's \nway of passing time, but of engendering possibility. Work is \nnot a way of arriving at a desired present and securing it \nagainst an unpredictable future, but of moving toward a future \nwhich itself has a future . \nInfinite players cannot say how much they have completed \nin their work or love or quarreling, but only that much remains \nincomplete in it. They are not concerned to determine when \nit is over, but only what comes of it. \nFor the finite player in us freedom is a function of time. \nWe must have the time to be free. For the infinite player \nin us time is a function of freedom . We are free to have \ntime . A finite player puts play into time. An infinite player \nputs time into play. \n69 \nJust as infinite players can play any number of finite games, \nso too can they join the audience of any game . They do so, \nhowever, for the play that is in observing, quite aware that \nthey are audience . They look, but they see that they are look­\nmg. \nInfinite play remains invisible to the finite observer. Such \nviewers are looking for closure, for the ways in which players \ncan bring matters to a conclusion and finish whatever remains \nunfinished . They are looking for the way time has exhausted \nitself, or will soon do so. Finite players stand before infinite \nplayas they stand before art, looking at it, making a poiema \nof it. \nIf, however, the observers see the poiesis in the work they \ncease at once being observers. They find themselves in its \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 95\n\f\ntime, aware that it remains unfinished, aware that their reading \nof the poetry is itself poetry . Infected then by the genius of \nthe artist they recover their own genius, becoming beginners \nwith nothing but possibility ahead of them . \nIf the goal of finite play is to win titles for their timelessness, \nand thus eternal life for oneself, the essence of infinite play \nis the paradoxical engagement with temporality that Meister \nEckhart called \"eternal birth.\" \n96"

    "raw_text": "70 \nNATURE IS the realm of the unspeakable. It has no voice of \nits own, and nothing to say. We experien~e the unspeakability \nof nature as its utter indifference to human culture. \nThe Master Player in us tolerates this indifference scarcely \nat all. Indeed, we respond to it as a challenge, an invitation \nto confrontation and struggle. If nature will offer us no home, \noffer us nothing at all, we will then clear and arrange a space \nfor ourselves. We take nature on as an opponent to be subdued \nfor the sake of civilization. We count among the highest \nachievements of modern society the development of a technol­\nogy that allows us to master nature's vagaries. \nThe effort has largely taken the form of theatricalizing our \nrelation to nature . Like any Master Player we have been pa­\ntiently attentive to the slightest clues in our opponent's behav­\nior-as a way of preparing ourselves against surprise. Like \nhunters stalking their prey, we have learned to mimic the \nmovements of nature, waiting for the chance to take hold \nof them before they get away from us. \"Nature, to be com­\nmanded, must be obeyed\" (Bacon). It is as though, by learning \nits secret script, we have learned to direct its playas well. \nThere is little left to surprise us. \nThe assumption guiding our struggle against nature is that \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 99\n\f\ndeep within itself nature contains a structure, an order, that \nis ultimately intelligible to the human understanding. Since \nthis inherent structure determines the way things change, and \nis not itself subject to change , we speak of nature being lawful, \nof repeating itself according to quite predictable patterns. \nWhat we have done by showing that certain events repeat \nthemselves according to known laws is to explain them . Expla­\nnation is the mode of discourse in which we show why matters \nmust be as they are. All laws made use of in explanation \nlook backward in time from the, conclusion or the completion \nof a sequence . It is implicit in all explanatory discourse that \njust as there is a discoverable necessity in the outcome of \npast events, there is a discoverable necessity in future events. \nWhat can be explained can also be predicted, if one knows \nthe initial events and the laws covering their succession. A \nprediction is but an explanation in advance. \nBecause of its thorough lawfulness nature has no genius \nof its own. On the contrary, it is sometimes thought that \nthe grandest discovery of the human genius is the perfect \ncompatibility between the structure of the natural order and \nthe structure of the mind, thereby making a complete under­\nstanding of nature possible. \"One may say 'the eternal mystery \nof the world is its comprehensibility' \" (Einstein) . \nThis is as much as to say that nature does have a voice, \nand its voice is no different from our own. We can then \npresume to speak for the unspeakable. \nThis achievement is often raised as a sign of the great \nsuperiority of modern civilization over the many faded and \nlost civilizations of the ancients . While our great skill lies in \nfinding patterns of repetition under the apparent play of acci­\ndent and chance, less successful civilizations dealt with the \nthreats of natural accident by appealing to supernatural powers \n100\n\f\nfor protection. But the voices of the gods proved to be ignorant \nand false; they have been silenced by the truth . \n71 \nThere is an irony in our silencing of the gods. By presuming \nto speak for the unspeakable, by hearing our own voice as \nthe voice of nature, we have had to step outside the circle \nof nature. I t is one thing for physics and chemistry to be \nspeaking about nature; it is quite another for physics and \nchemistry to be the speaking of nature . No chemist would \nwant to say that chemistry is itself chemical, for our speaking \ncannot be both chemical and about chemistry. If speaking \nabout a process is itself part of the process, there is something \nthat must remain permanently hidden from the speaker. To \nbe intelligible at all, we must claim that we can step aside \nfrom the process and comment on it \"objectively\" and \"dispas­\nsionately,\" without anything obstructing our view of these \nmatters . Here lies the irony: By way of this perfectly reasonable \nclaim the gods have stolen back into our struggle with nature . \nBy depriving the gods of their own voices, the gods have \ntaken ours. It is we who speak as supernatural intelligences \nand powers, masters of the forces of nature. \nThis irony passes unnoticed only so long as we continue \nto veil ourselves against what we can otherwise plainly see: \nnature allows no master over itself. Bacon's principle works \nboth ways. If we must obey to command, then our command­\ning is only obeying and not commanding at all. There is no \nsuch thing as an unnatural act. Nothing can be done to or \nagainst nature, much less outside it. Therefore, the ignorance \nwe thought we could avoid by an unclouded observation of \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 101\n\f\nnature has swept us back into itself. What we thought we \nread in nature we discover we have read into nature. \"We \nhave to remember that what we observe is not nature in itself \nbut nature exposed to our method of questioning\" (Heisen­\nberg). \n72 \nWeare speaking now of no ordinary ignorance. I t is not \nwhat we could have known but do not; it is unintelligibility \nitself: that which no mind can ever comprehend. \nUnveiled, aware of the insuperable limitation placed against \nall our looking, we come back to nature 's perfect silence. Now \nwe can see that it is a silence so complete there is no way \nof knowing what it is silent about-if anything . What we \nlearn from this silence is the unlikeness between nature and \nwhatever we could think or say about it. But this silence \nhas an irony of its own: Far from stupefying us, it provides \nan indispensable condition to the mind's own originality. By \nconfronting us with radical unlikeness, nature becomes the \nsource of metaphor . \nMetaphor is the joining of like to unlike such that one \ncan never become the other. Metaphor requires an irreducibil­\nity, an imperturbable indifference of its terms for one another . \nThe falcon can be the \"kingdom of daylight's dauphin\" only \nif the daylight could have no dauphin, could indeed have \nnothing to do with dauphins . \nAt its root all language has the character of metaphor, be­\ncause no matter what it intends to be about it remains lan­\nguage, and remains absolutely unlike whatever it is about. \nThis means that we can never have the falcon, only the word \n\"falcon .\" To say that we have the falcon, and not the \"falcon,\" \n102"

There is no refuge outside history for such viewers, any \nmore than there is a vantage outside nature . \nSince history is the drama of genius, its relentless surprise \ntempts us into designing boundaries for it, searching through \nit for patterns of repetition. Historians sometimes speak of \ntrends, of cycles, of currents, of forces, as though they were \ndescribing natural events. In doing so they must dehistoricize \nthemselves, taking a perspective from the timeless, believing \nthat each observed history is always of others and never of \nthemselves, that each observation is of history but not itself \nhistorical. \nGenuine historians therefore reverse the assumption of the \nobservers of nature that the observation itself cannot be an \nact of nature . Historians who understand themselves to be \nhistorical abandon explanation altogether . The mode of dis­\ncourse appropriate to such self-aware history is narrative. \nLike explanation, narrative is concerned with a sequence \nof events and brings its tale to a conclusion. However, there \nis no general law that makes this outcome necessary. In a \ngenuine story there is no law that makes any act necessary. \nExplanations place all apparent possibilities into the context \nof the necessary; stories set all necessities into the context \nof the possible. \nExplanation can tolerate a degree of chance, but it cannot \ncomprehend freedom at all. We explain nothing when we \nsay that persons do whatever they do because they choose \nto do it. On the other hand, causation cannot find a place \nin narrative . We have not told a story when we show that \npersons do whatever they do because they were caused to \ndo it-by their genes, their social circumstances, or the influ­\nence of the gods. \nExplanations settle issues, showing that matters must end \nas they have. Narratives raise issues, showing that matters \n104\n\f\ndo not end as they must but as they do. Explanation sets \nthe need for further inquiry aside; narrative invites us to \nrethink what we thought we knew. \nIf the silence of nature is the possibility of language, lan­\nguage is the possibility of history . \n74 \nSuccessful explanations do not draw attention to themselves \nas modes of speaking, because what is explained is not itself \nsubject to history. If I explain to you why cold water sinks \nto the bottom of the pond and ice rises to the surface, I \ncertainly do not intend my explanation to be true now and \nnot later. The explanation is true anywhere and any time . \nThat I choose to explain this to you in this time and place, \nhowever, is historical; it is an event-the narrative of our \nrelation with each other. There must therefore be a reason \nfor the speaking of this verity. Explanations are not offered \ngratuitiously , just because, say, ice happens to float. I can \nexplain nothing to you unless I first draw your attention to \npatent inadequacies in your knowledge: discontinuities in the \nrelations between objects, or the presence of anomalies you \ncannot account for by any of the laws known to you. You \nwill remain deaf to my explanations until you suspect yourself \nof falsehood. \nMany of these suspicions are, of course, minor, requiring \nmerely small adjustments in one's views, incurring no doubt \nwhatsoever concerning those views. Major challenges, how­\never, are too serious to be met with argument, or with sharp­\nened explanation . They call either for outright and wholesale \nrejection, or for conversion. One does not cross over from \nManichaeism to Christianity, or from Lamarckianism to Dar-\nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES \\05\n\f\nwinism, by a mere adjustment of views. True conversions con­\nsist in the choice of a new audience, that is, of a new world. \nAll that was once familiar is now seen in startlingly new ways. \nAs theatrical as conversions are, they remain oblivious to \nthe degree to which choice is involved in the passage from \none world to another. Radical conversions, especially, veil \nthemsel ves against their own arbitrariness . Augustine , the most \nfamous convert of antiquity , was puzzled that he could have \nheld so firmly to so many different falsehoods; he was not \nastounded that there are so many different truths . His conver­\nsion was not from explanation to narrative , but from one \nexplanation to another. When he crossed the line from pagan­\nism to Christianity, he arrived in the territory of a truth beyond \nfurther challenge . \nExplanations succeed only by convincing resistant hearers \nof their error. If you will not hear my explanations until you \nare suspicious of your own truths, you will not accept my \nexplanations until you are convinced of your error. Explanation \nis an antagonistic encounter that succeeds by defeating an \nopponent. It possesses the same dynamic of resentment found \nin other finite play. I will press my explanations on you because \nI need to show that I do not live in the error that I think \nothers think I do. \nWhoever wins this struggle is privileged with the claim \nto true knowledge. Knowledge has been arrived at, it is the \noutcome of this engagement. I ts winners have the uncontested \npower to make certain statements of fact. They are to be \nlistened to. In those areas appropriate to the contests now \nconcluded, winners possess a knowledge that no longer can \nbe challenged . \nKnowledge, therefore, is like property . It must be published, \ndeclared, or in some other way so displayed that others cannot \n106\n\f\nbut take account of it. It must stand in their way. It must \nbe emblematic , pointing backward at its possessor's competi­\ntive skill. \nSo close are knowledge and property that they are often \nthought to be continuous . Those who are entitled to knowl­\nedge feel they should be granted property as well, and those \nwho are entitled to property believe a certain knowledge goes \nwith it. Scholars demand higher salaries for their publishable \nsuccesses; industrialists sit on university boards. \n75 \nIf explanation, to be successful, must be oblivious to the \nsilence of nature, it must also in its success impose silence \non its listeners. Imposed silence is the first consequence of \nthe Master Player's triumph. \nWhat one wins in a title is the privilege of magisterial \nspeech. The privilege of magisterial speech is the highest honor \nattaching to any title . We expect the first act of a winner \nto be a speech. The first act of the loser may also be a speech, \nbut it will be a speech to concede victory, to declare there \nwill be no further challenge to the winner. It is a speech \nthat promises to silence the loser's voice. \nThe silence to which the losers pledge themselves is the \nsilence of obedience . Losers have nothing to say; nor have \nthey an audience who would listen. The vanquished are effec­\ntively of one will with the victors, and of one mind; they \nare completely incapable of opposition, and therefore without \nany otherness whatsoever. \nThe victorious do not speak with the defeated; they speak \nfor the defeated .

    "raw_text": "and parents for their children . Kings speak for the realm, \ngovernors for the state, popes for the church . Indeed, the \ntitled, as titled, cannot speak with anyone. \nIt is chiefly in magisterial speech that the power of winners \nresides. To be powerful is to have one's words obeyed. It is \nonly by magisterial speech that the emblematic property of \nwinners can be safeguarded . Those entitled to their possessions \nhave the privilege of calling the police, calling up an army, \nto force the recognition of their emblems. \nThe power of gods is known principally through their utter ­\nances. The sicut dixit dominus (thus says the lord) is always \na signal for ritual silence. The speech of a god can be so \nperfectly expressive of that god's power that the god and its \nspeech become identical: \"In the beginning was the word. \nThe word was with God, and the word was God .\" \nOne is speechless before a god, or silent before a winner, \nbecause it no longer matters to others what one has to say. \nTo lose a contest is to become obedient ; to become obedient \nis to lose one's listeners. The silence of obedience is an unheard \nsilence. It is the silence of death . For this reason the demand \nfor obedience is inherently evil. \nThe silence of nature is the possibility of language. By subdu­\ning nature the gods give it their own voice, but in making \nnature an opponent they make all their listeners opponents . \nBy refusing the silence of nature they demand the silence \nof obedience . The unspeakability of nature is therefore trans­\nformed into the unspeakability of language itself. \n76 \nInfinite speech is that mode of discourse that consistently \nreminds us of the unspeakability of nature . It bears no claim \n108\n\f\nto truth, originating from nothing but the genius of the \nspeaker. Infinite speech is therefore not about anything ; it \nis always to someone . I t is not command, but address. 1 t \nbelongs entirely to the speakable. \nThat language is not about anything gives it its status as \nmetaphor. Metaphor does not point at something there . Never \nshall we find the kingdom of daylight's dauphin in one place \nor another. It is not the role of metaphor to draw our sight \nto what is there, but to draw our vision toward what is not \nthere and, indeed, cannot be anywhere . Metaphor is horizonal , \nreminding us that it is one's vision that is limited , and not \nwhat one is viewing. \nThe meaning of a finite speaker's discourse lies in what \nprecedes its utterance, what is already the case and therefore \nis the case whether or not it is spoken. \nThe meaning of an infinite speaker's discourse lies in what \ncomes of its utterance-that is, whatever is the case because \nit is spoken. \nFinite language exists complete before it is spoken. There \nis first a language-then we learn to speak it. Infinite language \nexists only as it is spoken. There is first a language-when \nwe learn to speak it. It is in this sense that infinite discourse \nalways arises from a perfect silence. \nFinite speakers come to speech with their voices already \ntrained and rehearsed . They must know what they are doing \nwith the language before they can speak it. Infinite speakers \nmust wait to see what is done with their language by the \nlisteners before they can know what they have said. Infinite \nspeech does not expect the hearer to see what is already known \nto the speaker, but to share a vision the speaker could not \nhave had without the response of the listener. \nSpeaker and listener understand each other not because \nthey have the same knowledge about something, and not be-\nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 109\n\f\ncause they have established a likeness of mind, but because \nthey know \"how to go on\" with each other (Wittgenstein) . \n77 \nBecause it is address, attending always on the response of \nthe addressed, infinite speech has the form of listening. Infinite \nspeech does not end in the obedient silence of the hearer, \nbut continues by way of the attentive silence of the speaker. \nIt is not a silence into which speech has died, but a silence \nfrom which speech is born . \nInfinite speakers do not give voice to another, but receive \nit from another. Infinite speakers do not therefore appeal to \na world as audience, do not speak before a world, but present \nthemselves as an audience by way of talking with others . Finit e \nspeech informs another about the world-for the sake of being \nheard . Infinite speech forms a world about the other-for \nthe sake of listening . \nI t is for this reason that the gods, insofar as they speak as \nthe lords of this world, magisterially, speak before this world \nand are therefore unable to change it. Such gods cannot create \na world but can only be creations of a world-can only be \nidols. A god cannot create a world and be magisterial within \nit. \"The religions which represent divinity as commanding \nwhenever it has the power to do so seem false. Even though \nthey are monotheistic they are idolatrous\" (Weil) . \nA god can create a world only by listening . \nWere the gods to address us it would not be to bring us \nto silence through their speech, but to bring us to speech \nthrough their silence. \nThe contradiction of finite speech is that it must end by \nbeing heard . The paradox of infinite speech is that it continues \n11 0\n\f\nonly because it is a way of listening. Finite speech ends with \na silence of closure. Infinite speech begins with a disclosure \nof silence. \n78 \nStorytellers do not convert their listeners; they do not move \nthem into the territory of a superior truth . Ignoring the issue \nof truth and falsehood altogether, they offer only vision. Story­\ntelling is therefore not combative; it does not succeed or fail. \nA story cannot be obeyed. Instead of placing one body of \nknowledge against another, storytellers invite us to return from \nknowledge to thinking, from a bounded way of looking to \nan horizonal way of seeing. \nInfinite speakers are Plato's poietai taking their place in \nthe historical. Storytellers enter the historical not when their \nspeaking is full of anecdotes about actual persons, or when \nthey appear as characters in their own tales, but when in \ntheir speaking we begin to see the narrative character of OUT \nlives. The stories they tell touch us. What we thought was \nan accidental sequence of experiences suddenly takes the dra­\nmatic shape of unresolved narrative . \nThere is no narrative without structure, or plot. In a great \nstory this structure seems like fate, like an inescapable judg­\nment descending on its still unaware heroes, a great metaphys­\nical causality that crowds out all room for choice. Fate arises \nnot as a limitation on our freedom, but as a manifestation \nof our freedom, testimony that choice is consequent. The \nexercise of your freedom cannot prevent the exercise of my \nown freedom, but it can determine the context in which I \nam to act freely. You cannot make choices for me, but you \ncan largely determine what my choices will be about. Great \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES III\n\f\nstories explore the drama of this deeper touching of one free \nperson by another. They are therefore genuinely sexual dramas \nastounding us once more with the magic of origins. \nThe myth of Oedipus is one of many great sexual narratives \nin the cultural treasury of the West that plays on the dramatic \nrelation of fate and origin. Once Oedipus had impulsively \nkilled Laius, not knowing he was his own father, he was carried \nahead by ambition and lust into marriage with the dead man's \nwife, unaware of her true identity. We can read this as fate \nor we can read it as one act of willfulness that leads to another. \nOedipus has taken the posture of the Master Player executing \nterminal moves-but the moves are not terminal. Oedipus \nis able to bring nothing to an end. Even the act of blinding \nhimself, meant as a kind of concluding gesture, only brings \nhim to a higher vision. What Oedipus sees is not what the \ngods have done to him, but what he has done . He learns \nthat what had been limited was his vision, and not what he \nwas viewing. His blinding is an unveiling, and like all unveiling \nit is self-unveiling. Confronted in the end with nothing but \nhis own genius, Oedipus is finally able to touch . The end of \nhis story is a beginning . \nWhat raises this story into the historical is not just that \nOedipus sees; it is that we see that he sees. We become \nlisteners who see that we are listening and therefore participat­\ning in a now enlarged drama of origins. Nothing is explained \nhere . On the contrary, what we see is that everything remains \nstill to be said. \n79 \nThere is a risk here of supposing that because we know \nour lives to have the character of narrative, we also know \n112\n\f\nwhat that narrative is. If I were to know the full story of \nmy life I would then have translated it back into explanation . \nIt is as though I could stand as audience to myself, seeing \nthe opening scene and the final scene at the same time , as \nthough I could see my life in its entirety . In doing so I would \nbe performing it, not living it. \nSocietal theorists are tempted into the belief that they know \nthe story of a civilization. They can script its final scene of \ntriumph or defeat. It is by way of such end-of-history thinking \nthat the discovered laws of behavior to which persons conform \nbecome the scripted laws of behavior to which they must \nconform. \nTrue storytellers do not know their own story. What they \nlisten to in their poiesis is the disclosure that wherever there \nis closure there is the possibility of a new opening , that they \ndo not die at the end , but in the course of play. Neither do \nthey know anyone else's story in its entirety. The primary \nwork of historians is to open all cultural termini , to reveal \ncontinuity where we have assumed something has ended, to \nremind us that no one 's life, and no culture , can be known, \nas one would know a poiema , but only learned, as one would \nlearn a poiesis. \nHistorians become infinite speakers when they see that \nwhatever begins in freedom cannot end in necessity. \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 11 3\n\f\n\n\f\nSIX \nWE CONTROL \nNATURE FOR \nSOCIETAL \nREASONS"

    "raw_text": "80 \nWE CONTROL NATURE for societal reasons. The control of \nnature advances with our ability to predict the outcome of \nnatural processes. Inasmuch as predictions are but explanations \nin reverse, it is possible that they will be quite as combative \nas explanations. Indeed , prediction is the most highly devel­\noped skill of the Master Player, for without it control of an \nopponent is all the more difficult. I t follows that our domina ­\ntion of nature is meant to achieve not certain natural outcomes, \nbut certain societal outcomes . \nA small group of physicists, using calcuiations of the highest \nknown abstraction , uncovered a predictable sequence of sub­\natomic reactions that led directly to the construction of a \nthermonuclear bomb . It is true that the successful detonation \nof the bomb proved the predictions of the physicists, but it \nis also true that we did not explode the bomb to prove them \ncorrect ; we exploded it to control the behavior of millions \nof persons and to bring our relations with them to a certain \nclosure. \nWhat this example shows is not that we can exercise power \nover nature, but that our attempt to do so masks our desire \nfor power over each other. This raises a question as to the \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 11 7\n\f\ncultural consequences of abandoning the strategy of power \nin our attitude toward nature. \nThe alternative attitudes toward nature can be characterized \nin a rough way by saying that the result of approaching nature \nas a hostile Other whose designs are basically inimical to our \ninterests is the machine, while the result of learning to disci­\npline ourselves to consist with the deepest discernable patterns \nof natural order is the garden. \n\" Machine\" is used here as inclusive of technology and not \nas an example of it-as a way of drawing attention to the \nmechanical rationality of technology . We might be surprised \nby the technological devices that spring from the imagination \nof gifted inventors and engineers, but there is nothing surpris­\ning in the technology itself. The physicists' bomb is as thor­\noughly mechanical as the Neanderthal's lever-each the \nexercise of calculable cause-and-effect sequences. \n\"Garden\" does not refer to the bounded plot at the edge \nof the house or the margin of the city. This is not a garden \none lives beside, but a garden one lives within. It is a place \nof growth, of maximized spontaneity . To garden is not to \nengage in a hobby or an amusement ; it is to design a culture \ncapable of adjusting to the widest possible range of surprise \nin nature . Gardeners are acutely attentive to the deep patterns \nof natural order, but are also aware that there will always be \nmuch lying beyond their vision. Gardening is a horizonal activ­\nity. \nMachine and garden are not absolutely opposed to each \nother. Machinery can exist in the garden quite as finite games \ncan be played within an infinite game.

    "raw_text": "garden the interest of the machine . We are familiar with a \nkind of mechanized gardening that has the appearance of \nhigh productivity, but looking closely we can see that what \nis intended is not the encouragement of natural spontaneity \nbut its harnessing. \n81 \nThe most elemental difference between the machine and \nthe garden is that one is driven by a force which must be \nintroduced from without , the other grown by an energy which \noriginates from within itself. \nCertainly machines of extraordinary complexity have been \nbuilt: spacecraft, for example, that sustain themselves for \nmonths in the void while performing complicated functions \nwith great accuracy . But no machine has been made, nor \ncan one be made, that has the source of its spontaneity within \nitself. A machine must be designed, constructed, and fueled . \nCertainly gardens can be treated with such a range of chemi­\ncal and technological strategies that we can speak of \"raising\" \nfood, and of the food we have raised as \"produce .\" But no \nway has been found, or can be found, by which organic growth \ncan be forced from without. The application of fertilizers, \nherbicides, and any number of other substances does not alter \ngrowth but allows growth; it is meant to consist with natural \ngrowth . A plant cannot be designed or constructed . Though \nwe seem to give it \" fuel\" in the form of rich earth and appropri­\nate nutrients , we depend on the plant to make use of the \nfuel by way of its own vitality. A machine depends on its \ndesigner and its operator both for the supply of fuel and its \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 119\n\f\nconsumption . A machine has not the merest trace of its own \nspontaneity or vitality. Vitality cannot be given, only found . \n82 \nJust as nature has no outside, it has no inside. It is not \ndivided within itself and cannot therefore be used for or against \nitself. There is no inherent opposition of the living and the \nnonliving within nature; neither is more or less natural than \nthe other. The use of agricultural poisons, for example, will \nsurely kill selected organisms; it will arrest the spontaneity \nof living entities-but it is not an unnatural act. Nature has \nnot been changed . All that changes is the way we discipline \nourselves to consist with natural order. \nOur freedom in relation to nature is not the freedom to \nchange nature; it is not the possession of power over natural \nphenomena . It is the freedom to change ourselves. We are \nperfectly free to design a culture that will turn on the awareness \nthat vitality cannot be given but only found, that the given \npatterns of spontaneity in nature are not only to be respected , \nbut to be celebrated. \nAlthough \"natural order\" is the common expression, it has \nsomething of a veiling quality about it. More properly speaking, \nit is not the order of nature but its irreducible spontaneity \nwith which we find ourselves contending . That nature has \nno outside, and no inside, that it suffers no opposition to \nitself, that it is not moved by unnatural influence, is not the \nexpression of an order so much as it is the display of a perfect \nindiHerence on nature's part to all matters cultural. \nNature's source of movement is always from within itself; \nindeed it is itself. And it is radically distinct from our own \nsource of movement. This is not to say that, possessing no \n120"

    "raw_text": "order, nature is chaotic . It is neither chaotic nor ordered . \nChaos and order describe the cultural experience of nature­\nthe degree to which nature's indifferent spontaneity seems \nto agree with our current manner of cultural self-control. A \nhurricane, or a plague, or the overpopulation of the earth \nwill seem chaotic to those whose cultural expectations are \ndamaged by them and orderly to those whose expectations \nhave been confirmed by them. \n83 \nThe paradox in our relation to nature is that the more \ndeeply a culture respects the indifference of nature, the more \ncreatively it will call upon its own spontaneity in response. \nThe more clearly we remind ourselves that we can have \nno unnatural influence on nature , the more our culture will \nembody a freedom to embrace surprise and unpredictabil­\nity. \nHuman freedom is not a freedom over nature; it is the \nfreedom to be natural, that is, to answer to the spontaneity \nof nature with our own spontaneity. Though we are free to \nbe natural, we are not free by nature; we are free by culture, \nby history. \nThe contradiction in our relation to nature is that the more \nvigorously we attempt to force its agreement with our own \ndesigns the more subject we are to its indifference, the more \nvulnerable to its unseeing forces. The more power we exercise \nover natural process the more powerless we become before \nit. In a matter of months we can cut down a rain forest \nthat took tens of thousands of years to grow, but we are helpless \nin repulsing the desert that takes its place. And the desert, \nof course, is no less natural than the forest. \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 121\n\f\n84 \nSuch contradiction is most obvious in the matter of machin­\nery. We make use of machines to increase our power, and \ntherefore our control, over natural phenomena . By exerting \nthemselves no more than is necessary to operate fingertip con­\ntrols, a team of workers can cut six-lane highways through \nmountains and dense forest, or fill in wetlands to build shop­\nping malls. \nWhile a machine greatly aids the operator in such tasks, \nit also disciplines its operator. As the machine might be consid­\nered the extended arms and legs of the worker, the worker \nmight be considered an extension of the machine . All ma­\nchines, and especially very complicated machines, require oper­\nators to place themselves in a provided location and to perform \nfunctions mechanically adapted to the functions of the ma­\nchine. To use the machine for control is to be controlled \nby the machine. \nTo operate a machine one must operate like a machine . \nUsing a machine to do what we cannot do, we find we must \ndo what the machine does. \nMachines do not, of course, make us into machines when \nwe operate them ; we make ourselves into machinery in order \nto op~rate them . Machinery does not steal our spontaneity \nfrom us; we set it aside ourselves, we deny our originality. \nThere is no style in operating a machine . The more efficient \nthe machine , the more it either limits or absorbs our unique­\nness into its operation . \nIndeed, we come to think that the style of operation does \nnot belong to the operator at all, but is inherent in the ma­\nchine . Advertisers and manufacturers speak of their products \nas though they have designed style into them. Most consumer \nproducts are \"styled\" inasmuch as they actually standardize \n122\n\f\nthe activity or the taste of the consumer. In a perfect contradic­\ntion we are urged to buy a \"styled\" artifact because others \nare also buying it-that is, we are asked to express our genius \nby giving up our genius. \nBecause we make use of machinery in the belief we can \nincrease the range of our freedom, and instead only decrease \nit, we use machines against ourselves. \n85 \nMachinery is contradictory in another way. Just as we use \nmachinery against ourselves, we also use machinery against \nitself. A machine is not a way of doing something; it stands \nin the way of doing something. \nWhen we use machines to achieve whatever it is we desire, \nwe cannot have what we desire until we have finished with \nthe machine, until we can rid ourselves of the mechanical \nmeans of reaching our intended outcome. The goal of technol­\nogy is therefore to eliminate itself, to become silent, invisible, \ncarefree. \nWe do not purchase an automobile, for example, merely \nto own some machinery. Indeed, it is not machinery we are \nbuying at all, but what we can have by way of it: a means \nof rapidly carrying us from one location to another, an object \nof envy for others, protection from the weather . Similarly, a \nradio must cease to exist as equipment and become sound. \nA perfect radio will draw no attention to itself, will make it \nseem we are in the very presence of the source of its sound. \nNeither do we watch a movie screen, nor look at television. \nWe look at what is on television, or in the movie, and become \nannoyed when the equipment intrudes-when the film is unfo­\ncused or the picture tube malfunctions. \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 123\n\f\nWhen machinery functions perfectly it ceases to be there­\nbut so do we. Radios and films allow us to be where we are \nnot and not be where we are. Morever, machinery is veiling. \nIt is a way of hiding our inaction from ourselves under what \nappear to be actions of great effectiveness. We persuade our­\nselves that, comfortably seated behind the wheels of our autos, \nshielded from every unpleasant change of weather, and raising \nor lowering our foot an inch or two, we have actually traveled \nsomewhere . \nSuch travel is not through space foreign to us, but in a \nspace that belongs to us. We do not move from our point \nof departure, but with our point of departure . To be moved \nfrom our living room by an automobile whose upholstered \nseats differ scarcely at all from those in our living rooms, to \nan airport waiting room and then to the airplane where we \nare provided the same sort of furniture, is to have taken our \norigin with us; it is to have left home without leaving home. \nTo be at home everywhere is to neutralize space. \nTherefore, the importance of reducing time in travel: by \narriving as quickly as possible we need not feel as though \nwe had left at all, that neither space nor time can affect \nus-as though they belong to us, and not we to them . \nWe do not go somewhere in a car, but arrive somewhere \nin a car. Automobiles do not make travel possible, but make \nit possible for us to move locations without traveling. \nThus, the theatricality of machinery: Such movement is \nbut a change of scenes. If effective, the machinery will see \nto it that we remain untouched by the elements, by other \ntravelers, by those whose towns or lives we are traveling \nthrough. We can see without being seen, move without being \ntouched . \nWhen most effective, the technology of communication \nallows us to bring the histories and the experiences of others \n124"

When most \neffective, the technology of travel allows us to pass through \nthe histories of other persons with the \"comforts of home,\" \nbut without changing those histories. \nWhen it is most effective, machinery will have no effect \nat all. \n86 \nIn still another way is machinery contradictory . Using it \nagainst itself and against ourselves, we also use machinery \nagainst each other. \nI cannot use machinery without using it with another . I \ndo not talk on the telephone; I talk with someone on the \ntelephone . I listen to someone on the radio, drive to visit a \nfriend, compute business transactions. To the degree that my \nassociation with you depends on such machinery, the connect­\ning medium makes each of us an extension of itself . If your \nbusiness activities cannot translate into data recognizable by \nmy computer, I can have no business with you. If you do \nnot live where I can drive to see you, I will find another \nfriend. In each case your relationship to me does not depend \non my needs but on the needs of my machinery . \nIf to operate a machine is to operate like a machine, then \nwe not only operate with each other like machines, we operate \neach other like machines. And if a machine is most effective \nwhen it has no effect, then we operate each other in such a \nway that we reach the outcome desired-in such a way that \nnothing happens . \nThe inherent hostility of machine-mediated relatedness is \nnowhere more evident than in the use of the most theatrical \nmachines of all: instruments of war. All weapons are designed \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 125\n\f\nto affect others without affecting ourselves, to make others \nanswerable to the technology in our control. Weapons are \nthe equipment of finite games designed in such a way that \nthey do not maximize the play but eliminate it. Weapons \nare meant not to win contests but to end them . Killers are \nnot victors; they are unopposed competitors, players without \na game, living contradictions. \nThis is particularly the case with the airborne electronic \nweaponry of the present century, where the operator deals \nonly with the technology-buttons, blips, lights, dials, levers, \ncomputer data-and never with the unseen opponent. Indeed, \nso empty of drama is the modern machinery of slaughter \nthat it is intended to assault enemies only while they are \nstill unseen. This reaches an extreme form in the belief that \nour enemies are not unseen because they are enemies, but \nare enemies because they are unseen. \nThere is a logic in the instrumentality of death that leads \nus to killing the unseen because they are unseen. The crudest \nspear or sword is raised by an attacker because the independent \nexistence of another cannot be countenanced-because the \nother cannot be seen as an other. Just as I insist that the \ncondition of our friendship is your unresisting use of the tele­\nphone, I will expect the weapon in my hand to function with­\nout finding an other that can resist it. Killers can suffer no \nsuggestion that they are living into the open, that their histo­\nries are not finished, that their freedom is always a freedom \nwith others, and not over others, that it is not their vision \nthat is limited but what they are viewing. \nThe fact that the technology of slaughter at vast distances \nhas become extremely sophisticated does not culturally ad­\nvance its highly trained operators over club-swinging primi-\n126\n\f\ntives; it makes complete the blindness that was but \nrudimentary in the primitive. It is the supreme triumph of \nresentment over vision. We are the unseeing killing the un­\nseen. \nNot everyone who uses machinery is a killer. But when \nthe use of machinery springs from our attempt to respond \nto the indifference of nature with an indifference of our own \nto nature, we have begun to acquire the very indifference to \npersons that has led to the century's grandest crimes by its \nmost civilized nations. \n87 \nIf indifference to nature leads to the machine , the indiffer­\nence of nature leads to the garden. All culture has the form \nof gardening: the encouragement of spontaneity in others by \nway of one's own, the respect for source, and the refusal to \nconvert source into resource. \nGardeners slaughter no animals. They kill nothing . Fruits , \nseeds, vegetables, nuts, grains, grasses, roots, Rowers, herbs, \nberries-all are collected when they have ripened, and when \ntheir collection is in the interest of the garden's heightened \nand continued vitality. Harvesting respects a source, leaves \nit unexploited, suffers it to be as it is. \nAnimals cannot be harvested. They mature, but they do \nnot \"ripen.\" They are killed not when they have completed \nthe cycle of their vitality but when they are at the peak of \ntheir vitality. Finite gardeners, converting agriculture into \ncommerce, \"raise\" or \"produce \" animals--or meat products­\nas though by machine . Animal husbandry is a science, a \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 127\n\f\nmethod of controlling growth. It assumes that animals belong \nto us. What is source in them is to be resource for us. Cattle \nare confined to pens to prevent such movement as would \n\"toughen\" their flesh. Geese, their feet nailed to the floor, \nare force fed like machines until they can be butchered for \ntheir fattened livers. \nWhile machinery is meant to work changes without chang­\ning its operators, gardening transforms its workers. One learns \nhow to drive a car, one learns to drive as a car; but one \nbecomes a gardener. \nGardening is not outcome-oriented . A successful harvest \nis not the end of a garden's existence, but only a phase of \nit. As any gardener knows, the vitality of a garden does not \nend with a harvest. It simply takes another form. Gardens \ndo not \"die \" in the winter but quietly prepare for another \nseason. \nGardeners celebrate variety, unlikeness, spontaneity. They \nunderstand that an abundance of styles is in the interest of \nvitality. The more complex the organic content of the soil, \nfor example-that is, the more numerous its sources of \nchange-the more vigorous its liveliness. Growth promotes \ngrowth. \nSo also in culture. Infinite players understand that the vigor \nof a culture has to do with the variety of its sources, the \ndifferences within itself. The unique and the surprising are \nnot suppressed in some persons for the strength of others. \nThe genius in you stimulates the genius in me. \nOne operates a machine effectively, so that it disappears, \ngiving way to results in which the machine has no part. One \ngardens creatively, so that all the sources of the garden's vitality \nappear in its harvest, giving rise to a continuity in which \nwe take an active part. \n128\n\f\n88 \nInasmuch as gardens do not conclude with a harvest and \nare not played for a certain outcome , one never arrives any­\nwhere with a garden. \nA garden is a place where growth is found . It has its own \nsource of change. One does not bring change to a garden, \nbut comes to a garden prepared for change, and therefore \nprepared to change. It is possible to deal with growth only \nout of growth. True parents do not see to it that their children \ngrow in a particular way, according to a preferred pattern or \nscripted stages, but they see to it that they grow with their \nchildren. The character of one's parenting , if it is genuinely \ndramatic, must be constantly altered from within as the chil­\ndren change from within . So, too, with teaching , or working \nwith, or loving each other. \nIt is in the garden that we discover what travel truly is. \nWe do not journey to a garden but by way of it. \nGenuine travel has no destination . Travelers do not go some­\nwhere, but constantl y discover they are somewhere else. Since \ngardening is a way not of subduing the indifference of nature \nbut of raising one's own spontaneity to respond to the disre­\ngarding vagaries and unpredictabilities of nature , we do not \nlook on nature as a sequence of changing scenes but look \non ourselves as persons in passage. \nNature does not change; it has no inside or outside . It is \ntherefore not possible to travel through it. All travel is there­\nfore change within the traveler, and it is for that reason that \ntravelers are always somewhere else. To travel is to grow. \nGenuine travelers travel not to overcome distance but to \ndiscover distance . It is not distance that makes travel necessary, \nbut travel that makes distance possible. Distance is not deter-\nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES ) 29\n\f\nmined by the measurable length between objects, but by the \nactual differences between them . The motels around the air­\nports in Chicago and Atlanta are so little different from the \nmotels around the airports of Tokyo and Frankfurt that all \nessential distances dissolve in likeness. What is truly separated \nis distinct; it is unlike. \"The only true voyage would be not \nto travel through a hundred different lands with the same \npair of eyes, but to see the same land through a hundred \ndifferent pairs of eyes\" {Proust}. \nA gardener, whose attention is ever on the spontaneities \nof nilture, acquires the gift of seeing differences, looks always \nfor the merest changes in plant growth, or in the composition \nof the soil, the emerging populations of insects and earth­\nworms. So will gardeners, as parents , see changes of the small­\nest subtlety in their children, or as teachers see the signs of \nan increasing skill, and possibly wisdom, in their students. A \ngarden, a family, a classroom-any place of human gathering \nwhatsoever-will offer no end of variations to be observed, \neach an arrow pointing toward yet more changes. But these \nobserved changes are not theatrically amusing to genuine \ngardeners; they dramatically open themselves to a renewed \nfuture. \nSo, too, with those who look everywhere for difference, \nwho see the earth as source, who celebrate the genius in others, \nwho are not prepared against but for surprise. \"I have traveled \nfar in Concord\" {Thoreau}. \n89 \nSince machinery requires force from without, its use always \nrequires a search for consumable power. When we think of \n130\n\f\nnature as resource, it is as a resource for power. As we preoc­\ncupy ourselves with machinery , nature is increasingly thought \nof as a reservoir of needed substances . It is a quantity of \nmaterials that exist to be consumed , chiefly in our machines. \nBeing undivided , nature cannot be used against itself. We \ndo not therefore consume it, or exhaust it. We simply rear­\nrange our societal patterns in a way that reduces our ability \nto respond creatively to the existing patterns of spontaneity . \nThat is, to use the societal expression, we create waste. Waste, \nof course, is by no means unnatural . The trash and garbage \nof a civilization do not befoul nature; they are nature-but \nin a form society no longer is able to exploit for its own \nends. \nSociety regards its waste as an unfortunate , but necessary, \nconsequence of its activities-what is left when we have made \nessential societal goods available. But waste is not the result \nof what we have made. It is what we have made . Waste \nplutonium is not an indirect consequence of the nuclear indus­\ntry; it is a product of that industry. \n90 \nWaste is unveiling. As we find ourselves standing in garbage \nthat we know is our own, we find also that it is garbage we \nhave chosen to make, and having chosen to make it could \nchoose not to make it. Because waste is unveiling, we remove \nit. We place it where it is out of sight. We either find unin­\nhabited areas where waste can be disposed of, or fill them \nwith our refuse until they become uninhabitable . Since a flour­\nishing society will vigorously exploit its natural resources, it \nwill produce correspondingly great quantities of trash, and \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 131\n\f\nquickly its uninhabited lands will overflow with waste, threat­\nening to make the society's own habitation into a waste­\nland. \nBecause waste is unveiling, it is not only placed out of \nsight, it is declared a kind of anti property . No one owns it. \nPart of the contradiction in the phenomenon of waste is that \ntreating nature as though it belongs to us we must soon treat \nnature as though it belongs to no one. Not only does no \none own waste, no one wants it. Instead of competing to \npossess these particular products, we compete to dispossess \nthem . We force it on others less able to rid themselves of \nit. Trash accumulates in slums, sewage runs downstream, air­\nborne acid drifts hundreds of miles settling on the lands of \nthose powerless to halt its \"disposal\" into the atmosphere . \nThousands of square miles of farm lands have been laid waste \nby the construction of multilane highways, or submerged \nby dams whose water is used to flush waste from distant \ncities. \nWaste is the antiproperty that becomes the possession of \nlosers. It is the emblem of the untitled . \nWaste is unveiling, because it persists in showing itself as \nwaste, and as our waste. If waste is the result of our indifference \nto nature, it is also the way we experience the indifference \nof nature . Waste is therefore a reminder that society is a \nspecies of culture . Looking about at the wasteland into which \nwe have converted our habitation, we can plainly see that \nnature is not whatever we want it to be; but we can also \nplainly see that society is only what we want it to be. \nI t is a consequence of this contradiction that the more \nwaste a society produces, the more unveiling that waste is, \nand thus the more vigorously must a society deny that it \nproduces any waste at all; the more it must dispose, or hide, \nor ignore, its detritus . \n132\n\f\n91 \nSince the attempt to control nature is at its heart the at­\ntempt to control other persons, we can expect societies to \nbe less patient with those cultures which express some degree \nof indifference to societal goals and values. I t is this repeated \nparallel that brings us to see that the society that creates \nnatural waste creates human waste. \nWaste persons are those no longer useful as resources to \na society for whatever reason, and have become apatrides, \nor noncitizens. Waste persons must be placed out of view­\nin ghettos, slums, reservations, camps, retirement villages, mass \ngraves, remote territories, strategic hamlets-all places of deso­\nlation, and uninhabitable. We live in a century whose Master \nPlayers have created many millions of such \"superfluous per­\nsons\" (Rubenstein) . \nA people does not become superfluous by itself, any more \nthan natural waste creates itself. It is society that declares \nsome persons to be waste. Human trash is not an unfortunate \nburden on a society, an indirect result of its proper conduct; \nit is its direct product. European settlers in the Ameri­\ncan, African, and Asian continents did not happen to come \nupon populations of unwanted persons nature had thrust in \ntheir way; they made them superfluous by way of some of \nthe most important and irreversible principles of their societ­\nIes. \nStrictly speaking, waste persons do not exist outside the \nboundaries of a society. They are not society's enemies. One \ndoes not go to war against them, as one goes to war against \nanother society. Waste persons do not constitute an alterna­\ntive or threatening society; they constitute an unveiling cul­\nture . They are therefore \"purged.\" A society cleanses itself of \nthem. \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES \\33\n\f\n92 \nWhen society is unveiled, when we see that it is whatever \nwe want it to be, that it is a species of culture with nothing \nnecessary in it, by no means a phenomenon of nature or a \nmanifestation of instinct, nature is no longer shaped and fitted \ninto one or another set of societal goals. Unveiled, we stand \nbefore a nature whose only face is its hidden self-origination: \nits genius. \nWe see nature as genius when we see as genius. \nWe understand nature as source when we understand our­\nselves as source. We abandon all attempts at an explanation \nof nature when we see that we cannot be explained, when \nour own self-origination cannot be stated as fact. We behold \nthe irreducible otherness of nature when we behold ourselves \nas its other. \n93 \nFor the infinite player, seeing as genius, nature is the abso­\nlutely unlike. The infinite player recognizes nothing on the \nface of nature . Nature displays not only its indifference to \nhuman existence but its difference as well. \nNature offers no home . Although we become gardeners \nin response to its indifference, nature does nothing of itself \nto feed us. In Jewish and Islamic mythology God provided \nus with a garden but did not, indeed could not, do the garden­\ning for us. It was only a garden because we could respond \nto it, because we could be responsible for it. Our responsibility \nlay in noting its variabilities and discrete features. We were \nto name the animals, separating one from the other . This \ngarden was not a machine-like device automatically providing \n134\n\f\nfood for us. Neither were we machine-like, driven from without \nand destined from within. According to this myth, God did \nbreathe life into us, but in order to continue living we had \nto do our own breathing. \nBut responsibility for the garden does not mean that we \ncan make a garden of nature, as though it were a poiema \nof which we could take possession. A garden is not something \nwe have, over which we stand as gods. A garden is a poiesis, \na receptivity to variety, a vision of differences that leads always \nto a making of differences. The poet joyously suffers the unlike, \nreduces nothing , explains nothing, possesses nothing . \nWe stand before genius in silence. We cannot speak it, \nwe can only speak as it. Yet, though I speak as genius, I \ncannot speak for genius. I cannot give nature a voice in my \nscript. I can not give others a voice in my script-without \ndenying their own source, their originality. To do so is to \ncease responding to the other, to cease being responsible. No \none and nothing belong in my script. \nThe homelessness of nature, its utter indifference to human \nexistence, disclose to the infinite player that nature is the \ngenius of the dramatic. \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 135"

    "raw_text": "SEVEN \nMYTH \nPROVOKES \nEXPLANATION \nBUT ACCEPTS \nNONE Of IT\n\f\n\n\f\n94 \nMYTH PROVOKES explanation but accepts none of it. Where \nexplanation absorbs the unspeakable into the speakable, myth \nreintroduces the silence that makes original discourse possible. \nExplanations establish islands, even continents, of order and \npredictability . But these regions were first charted by adventur­\ners whose lives are narratives of exploration and risk. They \nfound them only by mythic journeys into the wayless open. \nWhen the less adventuresome settlers arrive later to work \nout the details and domesticate these spaces, they easily lose \nthe sense that all this firm knowledge does not expunge myth, \nbut floats in it. \nFew discoveries were greater than Copernicus ', for they \nprojected an order into the heavens that no one has successfully \nchallenged. Many thought then , and some still think, that \nthis great statement of truth dispelled clouds of myth that \nhad kept humankind in retarding darkness. What Copernicus \ndispelled, however, were not myths but other explanations . \nMyths lie elsewhere. To see where, we do not look at the \nfacts in Copernicus' works; we look for the story in his stating \nthem . Knowledge is what successful explanation has led to; \nthe thinking that sent us forth, however, is pure story. \nCopernicus was a traveler who went with a hundred pairs \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 139\n\f\nof eyes, daring to look again at all that is familiar in the \nhope of vision. What we hear in this account is the ancient \nsaga of the solitary wanderer, the peregrinus, who risks any­\nthing for the sake of surprise. True, at a certain point he \nstopped to look and may have ended his journey as a Master \nPlayer setting down bounded fact. But what resounds most \ndeeply in the life of Copernicus is the journey that made \nknowledge possible and not the knowledge that made the \njourney successful. \nThat myth does not accept the explanations it provokes \nwe can see in the boldness with which thinkers in any territorial \nendeavor reexamine the familiar for a higher seeing. Indeed, \nthe very liveliness of a culture is determined not by how fre­\nquently these thinkers discover new continents of knowledge \nbut by how frequently they depart to seek them . \nA culture can be no stronger than its strongest myths. \n95 \nA story attains the status of myth when it is retold, and \npersistently retold, solely for its own sake. \nIf I tell a story as a way of bracing up an argument or \namusing an audience, I am not telling it for its own sake. \nTo tell a story for its own sake is to tell it for no other reason \nthan that it is a story. Great stories have this feature: To \nlisten to them and learn them is to become their narrators. \nOur first response to hearing a story is the desire to tell \nit ourselves-the greater the story the greater the desire. We \nwill go to considerable time and inconvenience to arrange a \nsituation for its retelling. It is as though the story is itself \nseeking the occasion for its recurrence, making use of us as \n140\n\f\nits agents . We do not go out searching for stories for ourselves; \nit is rather the stories that have found us for themselves. \nGreat stories cannot be observed, any more than an infinite \ngame can have an audience. Once I hear the story I enter \ninto its own dimensionality . I inhabit its space at its time . I \ndo not therefore understand the story in terms of my experi­\nence, but my experience in terms of the story. Stories that \nhave the enduring strength of myths reach through experience \nto touch the genius in each of us. But experience is the result \nof this generative touch, not its cause. So far is this the case \nthat we can even say that if we cannot tell a story about \nwhat happened to us, nothing has happened to us. \nIt was not Freud's theory of the unconscious that led hiJl1 \nto Oedipus, but the myth of Oedipus that shaped the way \nhe listened to his patients. \"The theory of instincts,\" he wrote, \n\"is so to say our mythology.\" So too, then, the theory of \nthe unconscious that follows from it, and the superego, and \nthe ego. This is a mythology of such poetic strength that it \nhas altered not only the way we understand our experience, \nbut our experience itself. Who of us has not known a crisis \nof ego, the disturbing presence of unwanted feelings, or the \nanxious recoil from a more polymorphously embodied sexual­\nity? These experiences are not described by Freud the dispas­\nsionate scientist; they are made possible by Freud the mythic \ndreamer. \nAs myths make individual experience possible, they also \nmake collective experience possible. Whole civilizations rise \nfrom stories-and can rise from nothing else. It is not the \nhistorical experience of Jews that makes the Torah meaningful. \nThe Torah is no more a description of the creation of the \nearth and early Jewish life than the theory of instincts is a \ndescription of the psyches of a handful of bourgeois Viennese \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 141\n\f\nof the early twentieth century . The Torah is not the story \nof the Jews; it is what makes Judaism a story. \nWe tell myths for their own sake, because they are stories \nthat insist on being stories-and insist on being told. We \ncome to life at their touch. \nHowever seriously we might regard them as so much inert \npoiema, and attach metaphysical meanings to them, they \nspring back out of their own vitality. When we look into a \nstory to find its meaning, it is always a meaning we have \nbrought with us to look at. \nMyths are like magic trees in the garden of culture . They \ndo not grow on but out of the silent earth of nature. The \nmore we strip these trees of their fruit or prune them back \nto our favored design, the more imposing and fecund they \nbecome . \nMyths, told for their own sake, are not stories that have \nmeanings, but stories that give meanings . \n96 \nStorytellers become metaphysicians , or ideologists, when \nthey come to believe they know the entire story of a people. \nThis is history theatricalized , with the beginning and end in \nplain sight. A psychoanalyst who looks for the Freudian myth \nin patients imposes a filter that lets through nothing the psy­\nchoanalyst was not prepared to find. \nThe psychotherapeutic relationship will become horizonal \nonly when both patient and therapist realize that the Freudian \nmyth does not determine the meaning of what happens be­\ntween them , but offers the possibility that their relationship \nwill have a story of its own. \nThe Freudian myth does not therefore repeat itself in their \n142\n\f\nrelationship, but resonates in it. Those Jews who claim the \nright to certain territories on the basis of a biblical promise, \nthose Christians who believe the Russians are the great evil \narmies foreseen in biblical prophecies of the end of the world, \nrepeat the bible but do not resonate with it. \nWe resonate with myth when it resounds in us. A myth \nresounds in me when its voice is heard in mine but not heard \nas mine. I do not resonate when I quote Jeremiah or when \nI speak as Jeremiah, but only when Jeremiah speaks in a way \nthat touches an original voice in me. The speech of New \nYorkers resonates not because they talk like New Yorkers, \nbut because when they talk we hear New York in their voice. \nThe resonance of myth collapses the apparent distinction \nbetween the story told by one person to another and the \nstory of their telling and listening . I t is one thing for you to \ntell me the story of Muhammad; it is quite another for me \nto tell the story of your telling me about Muhammad . Ordi­\nnarily we confine the story to the words of the speaker. But \nin doing so we treat it as a story quoted, not a story told. \nIn your relating, and not repeating, the story of Muhammad, \nI am touched, and I respond from my genius. Something \nhas begun. But in touching, you are also touched. Something \nhas begun between us. Our relationship has opened forward \ndramatically. Since this drama emerged from the telling of \nthe story of Muhammad , our story resonates with Muham­\nmad's, and Muhammad's with ours. \nAs myths are told, and continue to resound in the telling, \nthey come to us already richly resonant. The stories they are \nsound deeply with the stories of their telling. Their strength \nas stories lies in their ability to invite us into their drama . \nIt is a drama that contains an entire history of voices, sounding \nand resounding from a thousand sources in our culture . For \nthis reason myths are significantly unresolved-but unresolved \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 143"

    "raw_text": "in the way of an infinite game, having rules, or narrative struc­\nture, that allow any number of participants at any time to \nenter the drama without fixing its plot or bringing it to closure \nin a final scene. In such stories much will be said about closure, \nor death , but their telling will always disclose the way death \ncomes in the course of play and not at its end. \n97 \nMyths of irrepressible resonance have lost all trace of an \nauthor. Even when sacred texts are written down by an identifi­\nable prophet or evangelist, it is invariably thought that these \nwords were first spoken to their recorders and not spoken \nby them . Moses received the law and did not compose it. \nMuhammad heard the Quran and did not dictate it. Christians \ndo not read Mark but the gospel according to Mark. Hindus \nunderstand their most authoritative texts, the Vedas, to be \nheard (sruti), and the literature that derives from the Vedas \nto be composed (smriti). \nThe gospel can be heard nowhere except from those who \nthemselves have heard it. Although I might hear New York \nin your voice, there is no possibility I could hear New York \nby itself. No myth , therefore , exists by itself; neither does it \nhave a discoverable origin. Whom could we name as the first \nNew Yorker? Even when it is God who is heard by the prophet , \nit is a god who speaks in the language and idiom of the prophet , \nand not in locutions restricted to divine utterance-as though \nthat god's speaking were itself a form of listening . \nIndeed, myth is the highest form of our listening to each \nother , of offering a silence that makes the speech of the other \npossible. This is why listening is far more valued by religion \n144\n\f\nthan speaking. Fides ex auditu. Faith comes by listening, Paul \nsaid. \n98 \nThe opposite of resonance is amplification . A choir is the \nunified expression of voices resonating with each other ; a loud­\nspeaker is the amplification of a single voice, excluding all \nothers. A bell resonates, a cannon amplifies. We listen to \nthe bell, we are silenced by the cannon . \nWhen a single voice is sufficiently amplified, it becomes \na speaking that makes it impossible for any other voices to \nbe heard . We do not listen to a loudspeaker for what is being \nsaid, but only because it is all that is being said. Magisterial \nspeech is amplified speech; it is speech that silences. Loud­\nspeaking is a mode of command , and therefore a speech de­\nsigned to bring itself to an end as completely and swiftly as \npossible. The amplified voice seeks obedient action on the \npart of its hearers and an immediate end to their speech. \nThere is no possibility of conversation with a loudspeaker. \nIdeology is the amplification of myth. It is the assumption \nthat since the beginning and end of history are known there \nis nothing more to say. History is therefore to be obediently \nlived out according to the ideology. Just as the warm akers \nof Europe regularly melted down the bells to recast them \ninto cannon , the metaphysicians have found the meaning of \ntheir myths and announced those meanings without their nar­\nrative resonance. The myths themselves are now regarded as \nfalsehoods or curiosities, and are therefore to be disregarded, \nif not forbidden . \nWhat ideologists are concerned to hide is the choral nature \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 145\n\f\nof history, the sense that it is a symphony of very different, \neven opposed, voices, each nonetheless making the other \npossible. \n99 \nIf it is true that myth provokes explanation, then it is also \ntrue that explanation's ultimate design is to eliminate myth. \nIt is not just that the availability of bells in churches and \ntown halls of Europe makes it possible to forge new cannon; \nit is that the cannon are forged in order to silence the bells. \nThis is the contradiction of finite play in its highest form: \nto play in such a way that all need for play is erased. \nThe loudspeaker, successfully muting all other voices and \ntherefore all possibility of conversation, is not listened to at \nall, and for that reason loses its own voice and becomes mere \nnoise. Whenever we succeed in being the only speaker, there \nis no speaker at all. Julius Caesar originally sought power in \nRome because he loved to play the very dangerous style of \npolitics common to the Republic; but he played the game \nso well that he destroyed all his opponents, making it impossi­\nble for him to find genuinely dangerous combat. He was unable \nto do the very thing for which he sought power. His word \nwas now irresistible, and for that reason he could speak with \nno one, and his isolation was complete. \"We might almost \nsay this man was looking for an assassination\" (Syme). \nIf we are to say that all explanation is meant to silence \nmyth itself, then it will follow that whenever we find people \ndeeply committed to explanation and ideology, whenever play \ntakes on the seriousness of warfare, we will find persons trou­\nbled by myths they cannot forget they have forgotten . The \n146\n\f\nmyths that cannot be forgotten are those so resonant with \nthe paradox of silence they become the source of our thinking, \neven our culture , and our civilization. \nThese are the myths we can easily discover and name, but \nwhose meanings continually elude us, myths whose conversion \nto truth never quite fills the bells of their resonance with \nthe sand of metaphysical interpretation . These are often ex­\nceedingly simple stories. Abraham is an example. Although \nonly two children were born to Abraham in his long life, \nand one of those was illegitimate, he was promised that his \ndescendents would be as numberless as the stars of the heavens . \nAll three of the West's major religions consider themselves \nchildren of Abraham, though each has often understood to \nbe itself the only and final family of the patriarch, an under­\nstanding always threat ened by the resounding phrase : num­\nbered as the stars of the heavens. This is the myth of a future \nthat always has a future ; there is no closure in it. It is a \nmyth of horizon . \nThe myth of the Buddha 's enlightenment has the same \nparadox in it, the same provocation to explanation but with \nas little possibility of settling the matter. It is the story of a \nmere mortal, completely without divine aid, undertaking suc­\ncessfully a spiritual quest for release from all forms of bondage, \nincluding the need to report this release to others . The perfect \nunspeakability of this event has given rise to an immense \nflow of literature in scores of languages that shows no signs \nof abating . \nPerhaps the Christian myth has been the narrative most \ndisturbing to the ideological mind . It is, like those of Abraham \nand the Buddha , a very simple tale: that of a god who listens \nby becoming one of us. It is a god \"emptied\" of divinity, \nwho gave up all privilege of commanding speech and \"dwelt \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 147\n\f\namong us,\" coming \"not to be served, but to serve,\" \"being \nall things to all persons.\" But the worlds to which he came \nreceived him not. They no doubt preferred a god of magisterial \nutterance, a commanding idol, a theatrical likeness of their \nown finite designs. They did not expect an infinite listener \nwho joyously took their unlikeness on himself, giving them \ntheir own voice through the silence of wonder, a healing and \nholy metaphor that leaves everything still to be said. \nThose Christians who deafened themselves to the resonance \nof their own myth have driven their killing machines through \nthe garden of history, but they did not kill the myth. The \nemptied divinity whom they have made into an Instrument \nof Vengeance continues to return as the Man of Sorrows \nbringing with him his unfinished story, and restoring the voices \nof the silenced. \n100 \nThe myth of Jesus is exemplary, but not necessary. No \nmyth is necessary. There is no story that must be told. Stories \ndo not have a truth that someone needs to reveal, or someone \nneeds to hear. It is part of the myth of Jesus that it makes \nitself unnecessary; it is a narrative of the word becoming flesh, \nof language entering history; a narrative of the word becoming \nflesh and dying, of history entering language. Who listens \nto his myth cannot rise above history to utter timeless truths \nabout it. \nI t is not necessary for infinite players to be Christians; in­\ndeed it is not possible for them to be Christians-seriously . \nNeither is it possible for them to be Buddhists, or Muslims, \nor atheists, or New Yorkers-seriously . All such titles can only \n148\n\f\nbe playful abstractions, mere performances for the sake of \nlaughter. \nInfinite players are not serious actors in any story, but the \njoyful poets of a story that continues to originate what they \ncannot finish. \n101 \nThere is but one infinite game. \nFINITE AND INFINITE GAMES 149\n\f\n\n\f\nINDEX \nNumbers following entries refer to sections. \nAdams, John Quincy, 33 \nArt, 42, 43, 44; see also Poiema, Poiesis, \nPoietes \nAudience, 13, 54, 64,66,69,77 ; see also \nWorld \nAugustine, 74 \nBacon, Francis, 70, 71 \nBirth, 53 \nBismarck, von, Otto , 33 \nBlake, William , 52 \nBoundaries, 3, 4, 6, II, 45, 48, 60, 63, \n64; see also Limitations \nBurckhardt , Jacob, 33 \nContradiction , 13,21 , 22, 24, 54,83 \nCopernicus, 94 \nCulture, 33, 35, 36, 42--47, 80, 83, 87, \n91,92 \nDeath, II, 20-23 \nDickens, Charles, 36 (quoted) \nDramatic, the, 15, 16, 23, 54 \nEinstein , Albert, 70 \nEliot, George, 64 \nEvil, 30, 31, 75 \nExplanation, 70, 73-75, 78--80, 94, 99 \nFlew, Antony, 22 \nFreedom, 12, 13,47,68,73 ,78,79 , 82, \n83 \nFreud, Sigmund, 53, 58, 95 \nGarden , 80, 81 , 87, 88, 93 \nGenius , 51-55, 57, 58,60 ,69, 70, 73, \n76, 78, 84, 87, 88, 92, 93, 95, 96 \nHealing, 56 \nHegel, G .
