    "raw_text": "THE\nRICHEST\nMAN IN\nBABYLON\n\f\n\n\f\nThe Man Who\nDesired Gold\nBansir, the chariot builder of Babylon, was thor-\noughly discouraged. From his seat upon the low wall\nsurrounding his property, he gazed sadly at his sim-\nple home and the open workshop in which stood a\npartially completed chariot.\nHis wife frequently appeared at the open door. Her\nfurtive glances in his direction reminded him that the\nmeal bag was almost empty and he should be at\nwork finishing the chariot, hammering and hewing,\npolishing and painting, stretching taut the leather\nover the wheel rims, preparing it for delivery so he\ncould collect from his wealthy customer.\nNevertheless,' his fat, muscular body sat stolidly\nupon the wall. His slow mind was struggling pa-\ntiently with a problem for which he could find no\nanswer. The hot, tropical sun, so typical of this valley\nof the Euphrates, beat down upon him mercilessly.\nBeads of perspiration formed upon his brow and\ntrickled down unnoticed to lose themselves in the\nhairy jungle on his chest.\n1\n\f\n2     THE RICHEST MAN IN BABYLON\nBeyond his home towered the high terraced walls\nsurrounding the king's palace. Nearby, cleaving the\nblue heavens, was the painted tower of the Temple\nof Bel. In the shadow of such grandeur was his sim-\nple home and many others far less neat and well\ncared for. Babylon was like this—a mixture of gran-\ndeur and squalor, of dazzling wealth and direst pov-\nerty, crowded together without plan or system within\nthe protecting walls of the city.\nBehind him, had he cared to turn and look, the\nnoisy chariots of the rich jostled and crowded aside\nthe sandaled tradesmen as well as the barefooted\nbeggars. Even the rich were forced to turn into the\ngutters to clear the way for the long lines of slave\nwater carriers, on the \"king's business,\" each bearing\na heavy goatskin of water to be poured upon the\nhanging gardens.\nBansir was too engrossed in his own problem to\nhear or heed the confused hubbub of the busy city.\nIt was the unexpected twanging of the strings from\na familiar lyre that aroused him from his reverie. He\nturned and looked into the sensitive, smiling face of\nhis best friend—Kobbi, the musician.\n\"May the Gods bless thee with great liberality, my\ngood friend,\" began Kobbi with an elabourate salute.\n\" Y e t , i t d o e s a p p e a r t h e y h a v e a l r e a d y b e e n s o g e n e r -\no u s t h o u n e e d e s t n o t t o l a b o u r . I r e j o i c e w i t h t h e e i n\nthy good fortune. More, I would even share it with\nthee. Pray, from thy purse which must be bulging\nelse thou wouldst be busy in yon shop, extract but\ntwo humble shekels and lend them to me until after\nthe noblemen's feast this night. Thou wilt not miss\nthem ere they are returned.\"\n\"If I did have two shekels,\" Bansir responded\ngloomily, \"to no one could I lend them—not even to\n\f\nThe Man Who Desired Gold 3\nyou, my best of friends; for they would be my for-\ntune—my entire fortune. No one lends his entire for-\ntune, not even to his best friend.\"\n\"What,\" exclaimed Kobbi with genuine surprise.\n\"Thou hast not one shekel in thy purse, yet sit like\na statue upon a wall! Why not complete that chariot?\nHow else canst thou provide for thy noble appetite?\n'Tis not like thee, my friend. Where is thy endless\nenergy? Doth something distress thee? Have the\nGods brought to thee troubles?\"\n\" A t o r m e n t f r o m t h e G o d s i t m u s t b e , \" B a n s i r\nagreed. \"It began with a dream, a senseless dream,\nin w h i ch I th o ug h t I w as a m an o f m e an s. F ro m m y\nbelt hung a handsome purse, heavy with coins. There\nw e r e s h e k e l s w h i c h I c a s t w i t h c a r e l e s s f r e e d o m t o\nthe beggars; there were pieces of silver with which I\ndid buy finery for my wife and whatever I did desire\nfor myself; there were pieces of gold which made me\nf e e l a s s u r e d o f t h e f u t u r e a n d u n a f r a i d t o s p e n d t h e\nsilver. A glorious feeling of contentment was within\nme! You would not have known me for thy hard-\nworking friend. Nor wouldst have known my wife,\nso free from wrinkles was her face and shining with\nhappiness. She was again the smiling maiden of our\nearly married days.\"\n\"A pleasant dream, indeed,\" commented Kobbi,\n\"but why should such pleasant feelings as it aroused\nturn thee into a glum statue upon the wall?\"\n\"Why, indeed! Because when I awoke and remem-\nbered how empty was my purse, a feeling of rebel-\nlion swept over me. Let us talk it over together, for,\na s t h e s a i l o r s d o s a y , w e r i d e i n t h e s a m e b o a t , w e\ntwo. As youngsters, we went together to the priests\nto learn wisdom. As young men, we shared each oth-\ner's pleasures. As grown men, we have always been\n\f\n4    THE RICHEST MAN IN BABYLON\nclose friends. We have been contented subjects of our\nkind. We have been satisfied to work long hours and\nspend our earnings freely. We have earned much\ncoin in the years that have passed, yet to know the\njoys that come from wealth, we must dream about\nt h e m . B a h ! A r e w e m o r e t h a n d u m b s h e e p ? W e l i v e\ni n t h e r i c h e s t c i t y i n a l l t h e w o r l d . T h e t r a v e l l e r s d o\nsay none equals it in wealth. About us is much dis-\nplay of wealth, but of it we ourselves have naught.\nAfter half a lifetime of hard labour, thou, my best of\nfriends, hast an empty purse and sayest to me, 'May\nI b o r r o w s u c h a t r i f l e a s t w o s h e k e l s u n t i l a f t e r t h e\nnoblemen's feast this night?' Then, what do I reply?\nDo I say, 'Here is my purse; its contents will I gladly\ns h a r e ? ' N o , I a d m i t t h a t m y p u r s e i s a s e m p t y a s\nthine. What is the matter? Why cannot we acquire\nsilver and gold—more than enough for food and\nrobes?\n\"Consider, also, our sons,\" Bansir continued, \"are\nthey not following in the footsteps of their fathers?\nNeed they and their families and their sons and their\nsons' families live all their lives in the midst of such\ntreasurers of gold, and yet, like us, be content to ban-\nquet upon sour goat's milk and porridge?\"\n\"Never, in all the years of our friendship, didst\nt h o u t a l k l i k e t h i s b e f o r e , B a n s i r . \" K o b b i w a s\npuzzled.\n\"Never in all those years did I think like this be-\nfore. From early dawn until darkness stopped me, I\nhave laboured to build the finest chariots any man\ncould make, soft-heartedly hoping some day the\nGods would recognize my worthy deeds and bestow\nupon me great prosperity. This they have never done.\nAt last, I realize this they will never do. Therefore,\nmy heart is sad. I wish to be a man of means. I wish\n\f\nThe Man Who Desired Gold 5\nto own lands and cattle, to have fine robes and coins\nin my purse. I am willing to work for these things\nwith all the strength in my back, with all the skill in\nmy hands, with all the cunning in my mind, but I\nw i s h m y l a b o u r s t o b e f a i r l y r e w a r d e d . W h a t i s t h e\nmatter with us? Again I ask you! Why cannot we\nhave our just share of the good things so plentiful for\nthose who have the gold with which to buy them?\"\n\"Would I know an answer!\" Kobbi replied. \"No\nb e t t e r t h a n t h o u a m I s a t i s f i e d . M y e a r n i n g s f r o m m y\nlyre are quickly gone. Often must I plan and scheme\nthat my family be not hungry. Also, within my breast\nis a deep longing for a lyre large enough that it may\ntruly sing the strains of music that do surge through\nmy mind. With such an instrument could I make\nmusic finer than even the king has heard before?\"\n\"Such a lyre thou shouldst have. No man in all\nBabylon could make it sing more sweetly; could\nmake it sing so sweetly, not only the king but the\nGods themselves would be delighted. But how may-\ne s t t h o u s e c u r e i t w h i l e w e b o t h o f u s a r e a s p o o r a s\nthe king's slaves? Listen to the bell! Here they come.\"\nHe pointed to the long column of half-naked, sweat-\ning water bearers plodding labouriously up the nar-\nrow street from the river. Five abreast they marched,\neach bent under a heavy goatskin of water.\n\" A f i n e f i g u r e o f a m a n , h e w h o d o t h l e a d t h e m . \"\nKobbi indicated the wearer of the bell who marched\nin front without a load. \"A prominent man in his\nown country, 'tis easy to see:\"\n\"There are many good figures in the line,\" Bansir\nagreed, \"as good men as we. Tall, blond men from\nthe north, laughing black men from the south, little\nbrown men from the nearer countries. All marching\ntogether from the river to the gardens, back and\n\f\n6    THE RICHEST MAN IN BABYLON\nforth, day after day, year after year. Naught of happi-\nness to look forward to. Beds of straw upon which\nto sleep—hard grain porridge to eat. Pity the poor\nbrutes, Kobbi!\"\n\"Pity them I do. Yet, thou dost make me see how\nl i t t l e b e t t e r o f f a r e w e , f r e e m e n t h o u g h w e c a l l\nourselves.\"\n\"That is truth, Kobbi, unpleasant thought though it\nbe. We do not wish to go on year after year living slavish\nlives. Working, working, working! Getting nowhere.\"\n\"Might we not find out how others acquire gold\nand do as they do?\" Kobbi inquired.\n\"Perhaps there is some secret we might learn if we\nbut sought from those who knew,\" replied Bansir\nthoughtfully.\n\"This very day,\" suggested Kobbi, \"I did pass our\nold friend, Arkad, riding in his golden chariot. This\nI will say, he did not look over my humble head as\nmany in his station might consider his right. Instead,\nhe did wave his hand that all onlookers might see\nhim pay greetings and bestow his smile of friendship\nupon Kobbi, the musician.\"\n\"He is claimed to be the richest man in all Baby-\nlon,\" Bansir mused.\n\"So rich the king is said to seek his golden aid in\naffairs of the treasury,\" Kobbi replied.\n\" S o r i c h , \" B a n s i r i n t e r r u p t e d , \" I f e a r i f I s h o u l d\nmeet him in the darkness of the night, I should lay\nmy hands upon his fat wallet.\"\n\"Nonsense,\" reproved Kobbi, \"a man's wealth is\nnot in the purse he carries. A fat purse quickly emp-\nties if there be no golden stream to refill it. Arkad\nhas an income that constantly keeps his purse full,\nno matter how liberally he spends.\"\n\"Income, that is the thing,\" ejaculated Bansir. \"I\n\f\nThe Man Who Desired Gold     7\nwish an income that will keep flowing into my purse\nwhether I sit upon the wall or travel to far lands.\nArkad must know how a man can make an income\nfor himself. Dost suppose it is something he could\nmake clear to a mind as slow as mine?\"\n\"Methinks he did teach his knowledge to his son,\nNomasir,\" Kobbi responded. \"Did he not go to Ni-\nneveh and, so it is told at the inn, become, without\naid from his father, one of the richest men in that\ncity?\"\n\"Kobbi, thou bringest to me a rare thought.\" A\nnew light gleamed in Bansir's eyes. \"It costs nothing\nto ask wise advice from a good friend and Arkad\nwas always that. Never mind though our purses be\na s e m p t y a s t h e f a l c o n ' s n e s t o f a y e a r a g o . L e t t h a t\nnot detain us. We are weary of being without gold\nin the midst of plenty. We wish to become men of\nmeans. Come, let us go to Arkad and ask how we,\nalso, may acquire incomes for ourselves.\"\n\"Thou speakest with true inspiration, Bansir. Thou\nbringeth to my mind a new understanding. Thou\nmakest me to realize the reason why we have never\nfound any measure of wealth. We never sought it.\nThou hast laboured patiently to build the staunchest\nchariots in Babylon. To that purpose was devoted\nyour best endeavours. Therefore, at it thou didst suc-\nc e e d . I s t r o v e t o b e c o m e a s k i l f u l l y r e p l a y e r . A n d ,\nat it I did succeed.\n\"In those things toward which we exerted our best\nendeavours we succeeded. The Gods were content to\nl e t u s c o n t i n u e t h u s . N o w , a t l a s t , w e s e e a l i g h t ,\nbright like that from the rising sun. It biddeth us to\nlearn more that we may prosper more. With a new\nunderstanding we shall find honourable ways to ac-\ncomplish our desires.\"\n\f\n8     THE RICHEST MAN IN BABYLON\n\"Let us go to Arkad this very day,\" Bansir urged.\n\"Also, let us ask other friends of our boyhood days,\n. who have fared no better than ourselves, to join us\nthat they, too, may share in his wisdom.\"\n\"Thou wert ever thus thoughtful of thy friends,\nBansir. Therefore hast thou many friends. It shall be\na s t h o u s a y e s t . W e g o t h i s d a y a n d t a k e t h e m w i t h\nus.\"\n\f\nThe Richest Man in\nBabylon\nIn old Babylon there once lived a certain very rich\nman named Arkad. Far and wide he was famed for\nhis great wealth. Also was he famed for his liberality.\nHe was generous in his charities. He was generous\nwith his family. He was liberal in his own expenses.\nBut nevertheless each year his wealth increased more\nrapidly than he spent it.\nAnd there were certain friends of younger days\nwho came to him and said: \"You, Arkad, are more\nfortunate than we. You have become the richest man\nin all Babylon while we struggle for existence. You\ncan wear the finest garments and you can enjoy the\nr a r e s t f o o d s , w h i l e w e m u s t b e c o n t e n t i f w e c a n\nclothe our families in raiment that is presentable and\nfeed them as best we can.\n\"Yet, once we were equal.

When I ceased to pay out more\nthan nine-tenths of my earnings, I managed to get\nalong just as well. I was not shorter than before. Also,\nere long, did coins come to me more easily than be-\nf o r e . S u r e l y i t i s a l a w o f t h e G o d s t h a t u n t o h i m\nw h o k e e p e t h a n d s p e n d e t h n o t a c e r t a i n p a r t o f a l l\nhis earnings, shall gold come more easily. Likewise,\nhim whose purse is empty does gold avoid.\n\"Which desirest thou the most? Is it the gratifica-\ntion of thy desires of each day, a jewel, a bit of finery,\nbetter raiment, more food; things quickly gone and\nforgotten? Or is it substantial belongings, gold, lands,\nherds, merchandise, income-bringing investments?\nThe coins thou takest from thy purse bring the first.\nThe coins thou leavest within it will bring the latter.\n\"This, my students, was the first cure I did dis-\ncover for my lean purse: 'For each ten coins I put in,\nto spend but nine.' Debate this among yourselves. If\nany man proves it untrue, tell me upon the morrow\nwhen we shall meet again.\"\nTHE SECOND CURE\nControl thy expenditures\n\"Some of your members, my students, have asked\nm e t h i s : ' H o w c a n a m a n k e e p o n e - t e n t h o f a l l h e\nearns in his purse when all the coins he earns are not\nenough for his necessary expenses?' \" So did Arkad\naddress his students upon the second day.\n\"Yesterday how many of thee carried lean\npurses?\"\n\f\nSeven Cures for a Lean Purse 29\n\"All of us,\" answered the class.\n\"Yet, thou do not all earn the same. Some earn\nmuch more than others. Some have much larger fam-\nilies to support. Yet, all purses were equally lean.\nNow I will tell thee an unusual truth about men and\ns o n s o f m e n . I t i s t h i s : T h a t w h a t e a c h o f u s c a l l s o u r\n'necessary expenses' will always grow to equal our\nincomes unless we protest to the contrary.\n\"Confuse not the necessary expenses with thy de-\nsires. Each of you, together with your good families,\nhave more desires than your earnings can gratify.\nTherefore are thy earnings spent to gratify these de-\nsires insofar as they will go. Still thou retainest many\nungratified desires.\n\"All men are burdened with more desires than\nthey can gratify. Because of my wealth thinkest thou\nI may gratify every desire? 'Tis a false idea. There\nare limits to my time. There are limits to my strength.\nThere are limits to the distance I may travel. There\nare limits to what I may eat. There are limits to the\nzest with which I may enjoy.\n\" I s a y t o y o u t h a t j u s t a s w e e d s g r o w i n a f i e l d\nwherever the farmer leaves space for their roots, even\nso freely do desires grow in men whenever there is\na p o s s i b i l i t y o f t h e i r b e i n g g r a t i f i e d . T h y d e s i r e s a r e\na multitude and those that thou mayest gratify are\nbut few.\n\"Study thoughtfully thy accustomed habits of liv-\ning. Herein may be most often found certain accepted\nexpenses that may wisely be reduced or eliminated.\nLet thy motto be one hundred per cent of appreciated\nvalue demanded for each coin spent.\n\"Therefore, engrave upon the clay each thing for\nw h i c h t h o u d e s i r e t h t o s p e n d . S e l e c t t h o s e t h a t a r e\nnecessary and others that are possible through the\n\f\n30     THE RICHEST MAN IN BABYLON\nexpenditure of nine-tenths of thy income. Cross out\nthe rest and consider them but a part of that great\nmultitude of desires that must go unsatisfied and re-\ngret them not.\n\"Budget then thy necessary expenses. Touch not\nthe one-tenth that is fattening thy purse. Let this be\nthy great desire that is being fulfilled. Keep working\nwith thy budget, keep adjusting it to help thee. Make\nit thy first assistant in defending thy fattening\npurse.\"\nHereupon one of the students, wearing a robe of\nr e d a n d g o l d , a r o s e a n d s a i d , \" I a m a f r e e m a n . I\nbelieve that it is my right to enjoy the good things\no f l i f e . T h e r e f o r e d o I r e b e l a g a i n s t t h e s l a v e r y o f a\nbudget which determines just how much I may\ns p e n d a n d f o r w h a t . I f e e l i t w o u l d t a k e m u c h p l e a -\nsure from my life and make me little more than a\npack-ass to carry a burden.\"\nTo him Arkad replied, \"Who, my friend, would\ndetermine thy budget?\"\n\"I would make it for myself,\" responded the pro-\ntesting one.\n\"In that case were a pack-ass to budget his burden\nwould he include therein jewels and rugs and heavy\nbars of gold? Not so. He would include hay and\ngrain and a bag of water for the desert trail.\n\"The purpose of a budget is to help thy purse to\nfatten. It is to assist thee to have thy necessities and,\ninsofar as attainable, thy other desires. It is to enable\nthee to realize thy most cherished desires by de-\nfending them from thy casual wishes. Like a bright\nlight in a dark cave thy budget shows up the leaks\nfrom thy purse and enables thee to stop them and\ncontrol thy expenditures for definite and gratifying\npurposes.\n\f\nSeven Cures for a Lean Purse 31\n\" T h i s , t h e n , i s t h e s e c o n d c u r e f o r a l e a n p u r s e .\nBudget thy expenses that thou mayest have coins to pay\nfor thy necessities, to pay for thy enjoyments and to\ngratify\nthy worthwhile desires without spending more than nine-\ntenths of thy earnings.\"\nTHE THIRD CURE\nMake thy gold multiply\n\"Behold thy lean purse is fattening. Thou hast dis-\nciplined thyself to leave therein one-tenth of all thou\nearneth. Thou hast controlled thy expenditures to\nprotect thy growing treasure. Next, we will consider\nmeans to put thy treasure to labour and to increase.\nGold in a purse is gratifying to own and satisfieth a\nmiserly soul but earns nothing. The gold we may\nretain from our earnings is but the start. The earnings\nit will make shall build our fortunes.\" So spoke\nArkad upon the third day to his class.\n\"How therefore may we put our gold to work? My\nfirst investment was unfortunate, for I lost all. Its tale\nI will relate later. My first profitable investment was\na loan I made to a man named Aggar, a shield maker.\nOnce each year did he buy large shipments of bronze\nbrought from across the sea to use in his trade. Lack-\ning sufficient capital to pay the merchants, he would\nborrow from those who had extra coins. He was an\nhonourable man. His borrowing he would repay, to-\ngether with a liberal rental, as he sold his shields.\n\" E a c h t i m e I l o a n e d t o h i m I l o a n e d b a c k a l s o t h e\nrental he had paid to me. Therefore not only did my\ncapital increase, but its earnings likewise increased.\n\f\n32     THE RICHEST MAN IN BABYLON\nM o s t g r a t i f y i n g w a s i t t o h a v e t h e s e s u m s r e t u r n t o\nmy purse.\n\"I tell you, my students, a man's wealth is not in\nthe coins he carries in his purse; it is the income he\nbuildeth, the golden stream that continually floweth\ninto his purse and keepeth it always bulging. That is\nwhat every man desireth. That is what thou, each\none of thee, desireth; an income that continueth to\ncome whether thou work or travel.\n\"Great income I have acquired. So great that I am\ncalled a very rich man. My loans to Aggar were my\nfirst training in profitable investment. Gaining wis-\ndom from this experience, I extended my loans and\ni n v e s t m e n t s a s m y c a p i t a l i n c r e a s e d . F r o m a f e w\ns o u r c e s a t f i r s t , f r o m m a n y s o u r c e s l a t e r , f l o w e d i n t o\nmy purse a golden stream of wealth available for\nsuch wise uses as I should decide.\n\"Behold, from my humble earnings I had begotten\na hoard of golden slaves, each labouring and earning\nmore gold. As they laboured for me, so their children\nalso laboured and their children's children until great\nwas the income from their combined efforts.\n\"Gold increaseth rapidly, when making reasonable\nearnings as thou wilt see from the following: A\nf a r m e r , w h e n h i s f i r s t s o n w a s b o r n , t o o k t e n p i e c e s\nof silver to a money lender and asked him to keep\ni t o n r e n t a l f o r h i s s o n u n t i l h e b e c a m e t w e n t y y e a r s\nof age. This the money lender did, and agreed the\nrental should be one-fourth of its value each four\nyears. The farmer asked, because this sum he had set\naside as belonging to his son, that the rental be added\nto the principal.\n\"When the boy had reached the age of twenty\nyears, the farmer again went to the money lender to\ninquire about the silver. The money lender explained\n\f\nSeven Cures for a Lean Purse 33\nthat because this sum had been increased by com-\npound interest, the original ten pieces of silver had\nnow grown to thirty and one-half pieces.\n\" T h e f a r m e r w a s w e l l p l e a s e d a n d b e c a u s e t h e s o n\ndid not need the coins, he left them with the money\nlender. When the son became fifty years of age, the\nfather meantime having passed to the other world,\nthe money lender paid the son in settlement one hun-\ndred and sixty-seven pieces of silver.\n\"Thus in fifty years had the investment multiplied\nitself at rental almost seventeen times.\n\" T h i s , t h e n , i s t h e t h i r d c u r e f o r a l e a n p u r s e :to\nput each coin to labouring that it may reproduce its kind\neven as the flocks of the field and help bring to thee\nincome,\na stream of wealth that shall flow constantly into thy\npurse.\"\nTHE FOURTH CURE\nGuard thy treasures from loss\n\"Misfortune loves a shining mark. Gold in a man's\np u r s e m u s t b e g u a r d e d w i t h f i r m n e s s , e l s e i t b e l o s t .\nT h u s i t i s w i s e t h a t w e m u s t f i r s t s e c u r e s m a l l\namounts and learn to protect them before the Gods\nentrust us with larger.\" So spoke Arkad upon the\nfourth day to his class.\n\"Every owner of gold is tempted by opportunities\nwhereby it would seem that he could make large\nsums by its investment in most plausible projects.\nOften friends and relatives are eagerly entering such\ninvestment and urge him to follow.\n\"The first sound principle of investment is security\n\f\n34    THE RICHEST MAN IN BABYLON\nfor thy principal. Is it wise to be intrigued by larger\nearnings when thy principal may be lost? I say not.\nThe penalty of risk is probable loss. Study carefully,\nbefore parting with thy treasure, each assurance that\nit may be safely reclaimed. Be not misled by thine I\nown romantic desires to make wealth rapidly.\n\"Before thou loan it to any man assure thyself of\nhis ability to repay and his reputation for doing so,\nthat thou mayest not unwittingly be making him a\npresent of thy hard-earned treasure.\n\"Before thou entrust it as an investment in any\nfield acquaint thyself with the dangers which may\nbeset it.\n\"My own first investment was a tragedy to me at\nthe time. The guarded savings of a year I did entrust\nto a brickmaker, named Azmur, who was travelling\nover the far seas and in Tyre agreed to buy for me\nthe rare jewels of the Phoenicians. These we would\nsell upon his return and divide the profits. The Phoe-\nnicians were scoundrels and sold him bits of glass.\nMy treasure was lost. Today, my training would\nshow to me at once the folly of entrusting a brick-\nmaker to buy jewels.\n\"Therefore, do I advise thee from the wisdom of\nmy experiences: be not too confident of thine own\nwisdom in entrusting thy treasures to the possible\npitfalls of investments. Better by far to consult the\nwisdom of those experienced in handling money for\nprofit. Such advice is freely given for the asking and\nmay readily possess a value equal in gold to the sum\nthou considerest investing. In truth, such is its actual\nvalue if it save thee from loss.\n\" T h i s , t h e n , i s t h e f o u r t h c u r e f o r a l e a n p u r s e , a n d\no f g r e a t i m p o r t a n c e i f i t p r e v e n t t h y p u r s e f r o m b e i n g\nemptied once it has become well filled.

They do pay to\nexacting landlords liberal rentals for rooms where\ntheir wives have not a spot to' raise the blooms that\ngladden a woman's heart and their children have no\nplace to play their games except in the unclean alleys.\n\"No man's family can fully enjoy life unless they\ndo have a plot of ground wherein children can play\nin the clean earth and where the wife may raise not\nonly blossoms but good rich herbs to feed her family.\n\" T o a m a n ' s h e a r t i t b r i n g s g l a d n e s s t o e a t t h e f i g s\nfrom his own trees and the grapes of his own vines.\nTo own his own domicile and to have it a place he\nis proud to care for, putteth confidence in his heart\nand greater effort behind all his endeavours. There-\n\f\n36     THE RICHEST MAN IN BABYLON\nfore, do I recommend that every man own the roof\nthat sheltereth him and his.\n\"Nor is it beyond the ability of any well-intentioned\nman to own his home. Hath not our great king so\nwidely extended the walls of Babylon that within\nthem much land is now unused and may be pur-\nchased at sums most reasonable?\n\"Also I say to you, my students, that the money\nlenders gladly consider the desires of men who seek\nhomes and land for their families. Readily may thou\nborrow to pay the brickmaker and the builder for\nsuch commendable purposes, if thou can show a rea-\nsonable portion of the necessary sum which thou thy-\nself hath provided for the purpose.\n\"Then when the house be built, thou canst pay the\nmoney lender with the same regularity as thou didst\npay the landlord. Because each payment will reduce\nthy indebtedness to the money lender, a few years\nwill satisfy his loan.\n\"Then will thy heart be glad because thou wilt\nown in thy own right a valuable property and thy\nonly cost will be the king's taxes.\n\"Also wilt thy good wife go more often to the river\nto wash thy robes, that each time returning she may\nbring a goatskin of water to pour upon the grow-\ning things.\n\"Thus come many blessings to the man who own-\neth his own house. And greatly will it reduce his cost\nof living, making available more of his earnings for\npleasures and the gratification of his desires. This,\nt h e n , i s t h e f i f t h c u r e f o r a l e a n p u r s e :Own thy own\nhome.\"\n\f\nInsure a future income\n\"The life of every man proceedeth from his child-\nhood to his old age. This is the path of life and no\nman may deviate from it unless the Gods call him\nprematurely to the world beyond. Therefore do I say\nthat it behoves a man to make preparation for a suitable\nincome in the days to come, when he is no longer\nyoung, and to make preparations for his family should\nhe be no longer with them to comfort and support them.\nThis lesson shall instruct thee in providing a full\npurse when time has made thee less able to learn.\"\nSo Arkad addressed his class upon the sixth day.\n\"The man who, because of his understanding of the\nlaws of wealth, acquireth a growing surplus, should\ngive thought to those future days. He should plan\ncertain investments or provisions that may endure\nsafely for many years/yet will be available when the\ntime arrives which he has so wisely anticipated.\n'.'There are diverse ways by which a man may pro-\nvide with safety for his future. He may provide a\nh i d i n g p l a c e a n d t h e r e b u r y a s e c r e t t r e a s u r e .

The rental which\nSeven Cures for a Lean Purse 37\nTHE SIXTH CURE\n\f\n38    THE RICHEST MAN IN BABYLON\nthe money lender adds to this will largely add to its\nincrease. I do know a sandal-maker, named Ansan,\nwho explained to me not long ago that each week\nfor eight years he had deposited with his money\nlender two pieces of silver. The money lender had\nbut recently given him an accounting over which he\ngreatly rejoiced. The total of his small deposits with\ntheir rental at the customary rate of one-fourth their\nvalue for each four years, had now become a thou-\nsand and forty pieces of silver.\n\"I did gladly encourage him further by demon-\nstrating to him with my knowledge of the numbers\nt h a t i n t w e l v e y e a r s m o r e , i f h e w o u l d k e e p h i s r e g u -\nlar deposits of but two pieces of silver each week,\nthe money lender would then owe him four thou-\ns a n d p i e c e s o f s i l v e r , a w o r t h y c o m p e t e n c e f o r t h e\nrest of his life.\n\"Surely, when such a small payment made with\nregularity doth produce such profitable results, no\nman can afford not to insure a treasure for his old age\nand the protection of his family, no matter how prosperous\nhis business and his investments may be.\n\"I would that I might say more about this. In my\nmind rests a belief that some day wise-thinking men\nwill devise a plan to insure against death whereby\nmany men pay in but a trifling sum regularly, the\naggregate making a handsome sum for the family of\neach member who passeth to the beyond. This do I\nsee as something desirable and which I could highly\nrecommend. But today it is not possible because it\nmust reach beyond the life of any man or any part-\nnership to operate.

When I questioned him the cause of his\nnecessity, he complained that his earnings were in-\nsufficient to pay his expenses. Thereupon I explained\nt o h i m , t h i s b e i n g t h e c a s e , h e w a s a p o o r c u s t o m e r\nfor the money lender, as he possessed no surplus\nearning capacity to repay the loan.\n\f\n40     THE RICHEST MAN IN BABYLON\n\" 'What you need, young man/ I told him, 'is to\nearn more coins.

N o m a n\ncan go oftener than that.'\n\"We may smile at his simplicity, yet he did possess\none of the vital requirements to increase his earnings.\nWithin him was a strong desire to earn more, a\nproper and commendable desire.\n\"Preceding accomplishment must be desire.

For a man to desire five pieces of gold\nis a tangible desire which he can press to fulfilment.\nAfter he has backed his desire for five pieces of gold\nwith strength of purpose to secure it, next he can\nfind similar ways to obtain ten pieces and then\ntwenty pieces and later a thousand pieces and, be-\nhold, he has become wealthy.

It is exactly what they decided to\nfind out. They were shrewd men and keen thinkers.\nThat explains why their city became the richest and\nmost powerful city of their time.\nIn that distant past, they had no schools or col-\n43\n\f\n44    THE RICHEST MAN IN BABYLON\nleges. Nevertheless they had a centre of learning and\na very practical one it was. Among the towered\nbuildings in Babylon was one that ranked in impor-\nt a n c e w i t h t h e P a l a c e o f t h e K i n g , t h e H a n g i n g G a r -\nd e n s a n d t h e t e m p l e s o f t h e G o d s . Y o u w i l l f i n d s c a n t\nmention of it in the history books, more likely no\nmention at all, yet it exerted a powerful influence\nupon the thought of that time.\nThis building was the Temple of Learning where\nthe wisdom of the past was expounded by voluntary\nteachers and where subjects of popular interest were\ndiscussed in open forums. Within its walls all men\nmet as equals. The humblest of slaves could dispute\nwith impunity the opinions of a prince of the royal\nhouse.\nAmong the many who frequented the Temple of\nLearning, was a wise rich man named Arkad, called\nthe richest man in Babylon. He had his own special\nhall where almost any evening a large group of men,\nsome old, some very young, but mostly middle-aged,\ngathered to discuss and argue interesting subjects.\nSuppose we listen in to see whether they knew how\nto attract good luck.\nThe sun had just set like a great red ball of fire\nshining through the haze of desert dust when Arkad\nstrolled to his accustomed platform. Already full four\nscore men were awaiting his arrival, reclining on\nt h e i r s m a l l r u g s s p r e a d u p o n t h e f l o o r . M o r e w e r e\nstill arriving.\n\"What shall we discuss this night?\" Arkad inquired.\nAfter a brief hesitation, a tall cloth weaver ad-\ndressed him, arising as was the custom. \"I have a\nsubject I would like to hear discussed yet hesitate to\noffer lest it seem ridiculous to you, Arkad, and my\ngood friends here.\"\n\f\nMeet the Goddess of Good Luck 45\nUpon being urged to offer it, both by Arkad and\nby calls from the others, he continued: \"This day I\nhave been lucky, for I have found a purse in which\nthere are pieces of gold. To continue to be lucky is\nmy great desire. Feeling that all men share with me\nthis desire, I do suggest we debate how to attract\ngood luck that we may discover ways it can be en-\nticed to one.\"\n\"A. most interesting subject has been offered,\"\nArkad commented, \"one most worthy of our discus-\nsion. To some men, good luck bespeaks but a chance\nhappening that, like an accident, may befall one with-\nout purpose or reason. Others do believe that the\ninstigator of all good fortune is our most bounteous\ngoddess, Ashtar, ever anxious to reward with gener-\nous gifts those who please her. Speak up, my friends,\nwhat say you, shall we seek to find if there be means\nby which good luck may be enticed to visit each and\nall of us?\"\n\"Yea! Yea! And much of it!\" responded the grow-\ning group of eager listeners.\nThereupon Arkad continued, \"To start our discus-\nsion, let us first hear from those among us who have\nenjoyed experiences similar to that of the cloth\nweaver in finding or receiving, without effort upon\ntheir part, valuable treasures or jewels.\"\nThere was a pause in which all looked about ex-\npecting someone to reply but no one did.\n\" W h a t , n o o n e ? \" A r k a d a s k e d . \" T h e n r a r e i n d e e d\nmust be this kind of good luck.

I look to\nfind her, not at the gaming tables or the races where\nmen lose more gold than they win but in other places\nwhere the doings of men are more worthwhile and\nmore worthy of reward.\n\"In tilling the soil, in honest trading, in all of man's\noccupations, there is opportunity to make a profit\nupon his efforts and his transactions. Perhaps not all\nthe time will he be rewarded because sometimes his\njudgment may be faulty, and other times the winds\nand the weather may defeat his efforts. Yet, if he\npersists, he may usually expect to realize his profit.\nT h i s i s s o b e c a u s e t h e c h a n c e s o f p r o f i t a r e a l w a y s i n\nhis favour.\n\"But, when a man playeth the games, the situation\ni s r e v e r s e d f o r t h e c h a n c e s o f p r o f i t a r e a l w a y s\nagainst him and always in favour of the game keeper.\nThe game is so arranged that it will always favour the\nk e e p e r . .

Few players realize how certain are the game\nkeeper's profits and how uncertain are their own\nchances to win.\n\"For example, let us consider wagers placed upon\nthe cube. Each time it is cast we bet which side will\nbe uppermost. If it be the red side the game master\n\f\n48    THE RICHEST MAN IN BABYLON\npays to us four times our bet. But if any other of the\nfive sides come uppermost, we lose our bet. Thus the\nfigures show that for each cast we have five chances\nto lose, but because the red pays four for one, we\nhave four chances to win. In a night's play the game\nmaster can expect to keep for his profit one-fifth of\nall the coins wagered. Can a man expect to win more\nthan occasionally against odds so arranged that he\nshould lose one-fifth of all his bets?\"\n\"Yet some men do win large sums at times,\" vol-\nunteered one of the listeners.\n\"Quite so, they do,\" Arkad continued. \"Realizing\nthis, the question comes to me whether money se-\ncured in such ways brings permanent value to those\nwho are thus lucky. Among my acquaintances are\nmany of the successful men of Babylon, yet among\nt h e m I a m u n a b l e t o n a m e a s i n g l e o n e w h o s t a r t e d\nhis success from such a source.\n\"You who are gathered here tonight know many\nmore of our substantial citizens.

Are there any consistent win-\nn e r s w i t h u s w h o h e s i t a t e t o a d v i s e s u c h a s o u r c e f o r\ntheir incomes?\"\nHis challenge was answered by a series of groans\nf r o m t h e r e a r t a k e n u p a n d s p r e a d  a m i d m u c h\nlaughter.\n\f\nMeet the Goddess, of Good Luck 49\n\"It would seem we are not seeking good luck in\nsuch places as the goddess frequents,\" he continued,\n\"Therefore let us explore other fields.

As to the races,\n1 m u s t c o n f e s s t o h a v e l o s t f a r m o r e c o i n s t h e r e t h a n\nI have ever won.\n\"Now, suppose we consider our trades and busi-\nnesses! Is it not natural if we conclude a profitable\ntransaction to consider it not good luck but a just\nreward for our efforts? I am inclined to think we may\nbe overlooking the gifts of the goddess. Perhaps she\nreally does assist us when we do not appreciate her\ngenerosity. Who can suggest further discussion?\"\nThereupon an elderly merchant arose, smoothing\nhis genteel white robe. \"With thy permission, most\nhonourable Arkad and my friends, I offer a sugges-\nt i o n .

They would have been rare ex-\namples of good luck if they had actually happened.\nBecause they were not brought to fulfilment we can-\nnot consider them as our just rewards. Surely many\nmen here have such experiences to relate.\"\n\"Here is a wise approach,\" Arkad approved. \"Who\namong you have had good luck within your grasp\nonly to see it escape?\"\nMany hands were raised, among them that of the\nmerchant. Arkad motioned to him to speak. \"As you\nsuggested this approach, we should like to hear first\nfrom you.\"\n\"I will gladly relate a tale,\" he resumed, \"that doth\n\f\n50     THE RICHEST  MAN IN BABYLON\nIllustrate how closely, unto a man good luck may\napproach and how blindly he may permit it to es-\ncape, much to his loss and later regret.\n\"Many years ago, when I was a young man, just\nmarried and well-started to earning, my rather did\ncome one day and urge most strongly that I enter\nupon an investment. The son of one of his good\nfriends had taken notice of a barren tract of land not\nfar beyond the outer walls of our city. It lay high\nabove the canal where no water could reach it.\n\"The son of my father's friend devised a plan to\npurchase this land, build three large waterwheels\nthat could be operated by oxen and thereby raise the\nlife-giving waters to the fertile soil. This accom-\nplished, he planned to divide it into small tracts and\nsell to the residents of the city for herb patches.\n\"The son of my father's friend did not possess suf-\nficient gold to complete such an undertaking. Like\nm y s e l f , h e w a s a y o u n g m a n e a r n i n g a f a i r s u m . H i s\nfather, like mine, was a man of large family and\nsmall means. He, therefore, decided to interest a\ngroup of men to enter the enterprise with him. The\ngroup was to comprise twelve, each of whom must\nbe a money earner and agree to pay one-tenth of his\nearnings into the enterprise until the land was made\nr e a d y f o r s a l e . A l l w o u l d t h e n s h a r e j u s t l y i n t h e\nprofits in proportion to their investment.\n\" 'Thou, my son,' bespoke my father unto me, 'art\nnow in thy young manhood. It is my deep desire\nthat thou begin the building of a valuable estate for\nthyself that thou mayest become respected among\nmen. I desire to see thou profit from a knowledge of\nthe thoughtless mistakes of thy father.'\n\" 'This do I most ardently desire, my father,' I\nreplied.\n\f\nMeet the Goddess of Good Luck 51\n\" 'Then, this do I advise. Do what I should have\ndone at thy age. From thy earnings keep out one-\ntenth to put into favourable investments. With this\none-tenth of thy earnings and what it will also earn,\nt h o u c a n s t , b e f o r e t h o u a r t m y a g e , a c c u m u l a t e f o r\nthyself a valuable estate.'\n\" 'Thy words are words of wisdom, my father.\nGreatly do I desire riches. Yet there are many uses\nto which my earnings are called. Therefore, do I hesi-\ntate to do as thou dost advise. I am young. There is\nplenty of time/\n\" 'So I thought at thy age, yet behold, many years\nhave passed and I have not yet made the beginning.'\n' ' W e l i v e i n a d i f f e r e n t a g e , m y f a t h e r .

Today it is here; soon it is gone. Therefore,\ndelay not!'\n\"In spite of the advice of my father, I did hesitate.\nThere were beautiful new robes just brought by the\ntradesmen from the East, robes of such richness and\nbeauty my good wife and I felt we must each possess\none. Should I agree to pay one-tenth of my earnings\ninto the enterprise, we must deprive ourselves of\nthese and other pleasures we dearly desired. I de-\nlayed making a decision until it was too late, much\nto my subsequent regret. The enterprise did prove to\nbe more profitable than any man had prophesied.\nThis is my tale, showing how I did permit good luck\nto escape.\"\n\f\n52    THE RICHEST MAN IN BABYLON\n\" I n t h i s t a l e w e s e e h o wgood luck waits to come to\nthat man who accepts opportunity,\" commented a swar-\nthy man of the desert. \"To the building of an estate\nthere must always be the beginning. That start may\nbe a few pieces of gold or silver which a man diverts\nfrom his earnings to his first investment. I, myself,\nam the owner of many herds. The start of my herds\nI did begin when I was a mere boy and did purchase\nwith one piece of silver a young calf. This, being\nthe beginning of my wealth, was of great importance\nto me.\n\"To take his first start to building an estate is as\ng o o d l u c k a s c a n c o m e t o a n y m a n . W i t h a l l m e n ,\nthat first step, which changes them from men who\nearn from their own labour to men who draw divi-\ndends from the earnings of their gold, is important.\nSome, fortunately, take it when young and thereby\noutstrip in financial success those who do take it later\nor those unfortunate men, like the father of this mer-\nchant, who never take it.\n\" H a d o u r f r i e n d , t h e m e r c h a n t , t a k e n t h i s s t e p i n\nhis early manhood when this opportunity came to I\nhim, this day he would be blessed with much more\nof this world's goods.

W i t h t h e b i t t e r n e s s o f a w i l d a s s\nhitched to a chariot, I did break loose from this\nenemy to my success.\"\n\"Thank you! I like ask question from Mr. Mer-\nchant.\" The Syrian was speaking. \"You wear fine\nrobes, not like those of poor man. You speak like\nsuccessful man. Tell us, do you listen now when pro-\ncrastination whispers in your ear?\"\n\"Like our friend the buyer, I also had to recognize\nand conquer procrastination,\" responded the mer-\nchant. \"To me, it proved to be an enemy, ever watch-\ning and waiting to thwart my accomplishments. The\nt a l e I d i d r e l a t e i s b u t o n e o f m a n y s i m i l a r i n s t a n c e s\nI could tell to show how it drove away my opportu-\nnities. 'Tis not difficult to conquer, once understood.\nNo man willingly permits the thief to rob his bins of\ngrain. Nor does any man willingly permit an enemy\nto drive away his customers and rob him of his\nprofits. When once I did recognize that such acts as\nthese my enemy was committing, with determination\nI conquered him. So must every man master his own\nspirit of procrastination before he can expect to share\nin the rich treasures of Babylon.\n\"What sayest, Arkad? Because thou art the richest\nman in Babylon, many do proclaim thee to be the\nl u c k i e s t .

Some grasped\ntheirs and moved steadily to the gratification of their\ndeepest desires, but the majority hesitated, faltered\nand fell behind.\"\nArkad turned to the cloth weaver. \"Thou didst\nsuggest that we debate good luck. Let us hear what\nthou now thinkest upon the subject.\"\n\"I do see good luck in a different light. I had\nthought of it as something most desirable that might\nhappen to a man without effort upon his part. Now,\nI do realize such happenings are not the sort of thing\none may attract to himself. From our discussion have\nI learned that to attract good luck to oneself, it is neces-\nsary to take advantage of opportunities. Therefore, in the\nfuture, I shall endeavour to make the best of such\nopportunities as do come to me.\"\n\"Thou hast well grasped the truths brought forth\nin our discussion,\" Arkad replied. \"Good luck, we\ndo find, often follows opportunity but seldom comes\notherwise. Our merchant friend would have found\ngreat good luck had he accepted the opportunity the\ngood goddess did present to him. Our friend the\nbuyer, likewise, would have enjoyed good luck had\nhe completed the purchase of the flock and sold at\nsuch a handsome profit.\n\"We did pursue this discussion to find a means by\nwhich good luck could be enticed to us. I feel that\nwe have found the way. Both the tales did illustrate\nhow good luck follows opportunity. Herein lies a\ntruth that many similar tales of good luck, won or\nlost, could not change. The truth is this: Good luck\ncan be enticed by accepting opportunity.\n\"Those eager to grasp opportunities for their bet-\n\f\n58     THE RICHEST MAN IN BABYLON\ntorment, do attract the interest of the good goddess.\nShe is ever anxious to aid those who please her. Men\nof action please her best.\n\"Action will lead thee forward to the successes\nthou dost desire.\"\nMEN OF ACTION ARE FAVOURED BY\nTHE GODDESS OF GOOD LUCK"

Some I spent wisely, some I spent foolishly\nand much I lost in unwise ways.'\n\"Dost still think it but an inconsistency of fate that\nsome men have much gold and others have naught?\nThen you err.\n\"Men have much gold when they know the five\nlaws of gold and abide thereby.\n\"Because I learned these five laws in my youth and\nabided by them, I have become a wealthy merchant. Not\nby some strange magic did I accumulate my wealth.\n\"Wealth that comes quickly goeth the same way.\n\"Wealth that stayeth to give enjoyment and satis-\nfaction to its owner comes gradually, because it is a\nchild born of knowledge and persistent purpose.\n\"To earn wealth is but a slight burden upon the\nthoughtful man. Bearing the burden consistently\nfrom year to year accomplishes the final purpose.\n\"The five laws of gold offer to thee a rich reward\nfor their observance.\n\" E a c h o f t h e s e f i v e l a w s i s r i c h w i t h m e a n i n g a n d\nlest thou overlook this in the briefness of my tale, I\nwill now repeat them.

This law always sayeth that gold cometh\ngladly to such a man. I can truly certify this in my\nown life. The more gold I accumulate, the more\nreadily it comes to me and in increased quantities.\nThe gold which I save earns more, even as yours\nwill, and its earnings earn more, and this is the work-\ning out of the first law.\"\nTHE SECOND LAW OF GOLD\nGold laboureth diligently and contentedly\nf o r t h e w i s e o w n e r w h o f i n d s f o r i t p r o f i t -\nable employment, multiplying even as the\nflocks of the field.\n\" G o l d , i n d e e d , i s a w i l l i n g w o r k e r . I t i s e v e r e a g e r\nto multiply when opportunity presents itself. To\nevery man who hath a store of gold set by, opportu-\nnity comes for its most profitable use. As the years\npass, it multiplies itself in surprising fashion.\"\nTHE THIRD LAW OF GOLD\nGold clingeth to the protection of the cau-\ntious owner who invests it under the advice\nof men wise in its handling.\n\f\nThe Five Laws of Gold 71\n\"Gold, indeed, clingeth to the cautious owner, even\nas it flees the careless owner. The man who seeks the\nadvice of men wise in handling gold soon learneth not\nto jeopardize his treasure, but to preserve in safety and\nto enjoy in contentment its consistent increase.\"\nTHE FOURTH LAW OF GOLD\nGold slippeth away front the man who in-\nvests it in businesses or purposes with\nw h i c h h e i s n o t f a m i l i a r o r w h i c h a r e n o t\napproved by those skilled in its keep.\n\"To the man who hath gold, yet is not skilled in its\nhandling, many uses for it appear most profitable. Too\noften these are fraught with danger of loss, and if prop-\nerly analyzed by wise men, show small possibility of\nprofit. Therefore, the inexperienced owner of gold who\ntrusts to his own judgment and invests it in businesses or\npurposes with which he is not familiar, too often finds\nhis judgment imperfect, and pays with his treasure for\nhis inexperience.

Happily down the king's highway from the pal-\nace of his most liberal Majesty he strode. Cheerfully the\ng o l d c l i n k e d a s t h e w a l l e t a t h i s b e l t s w a y e d w i t h e a c h\nstep—the sweetest music he had ever heard.\nFifty pieces of gold! All his! He could hardly real-\nize his good fortune. What power in those clinking\ndiscs! They could purchase anything he wanted, a\ngrand house, land, cattle, camels, horses, chariots,\nwhatever he might desire.\nWhat use should he make of it? This evening as\nh e t u r n e d i n t o a s i d e s t r e e t t o w a r d t h e h o m e o f h i s\nsister, he could think of nothing he would rather pos-\nsess than those same glittering, heavy pieces of\ngold—his to keep.\nIt was upon an evening some days later that a\nperplexed Rodan entered the shop of Mathon, the\nlender of gold and dealer in jewels and rare fabrics\nGlancing  neither  to   the   right   nor the left at the colour-\n74\n\f\nThe Gold Lender of Babylon 75\nful articles artfully displayed, he passed through to\nthe living quarters at the rear; Here he found the\ngenteel Mathon lounging upon a rug partaking of a\nmeal served by a black slave.\n\"I would counsel with thee for I know not what\nto do.\" Rodan stood stolidly, feet apart, hairy breast\nexposed by the gaping front of his leather jacket.\nMathon's narrow, sallow face smiled a friendly\ngreeting. \"What indiscretions hast thou done that\nthou shouldst seek the lender of gold?

She does\nfeel that he has never had a chance and she beseeches\nme to loan to him this gold that he may become a\nprosperous merchant and repay me from his profits.\"\n\" M y f r i e n d , \" r e s u m e d M a t h o n , \" ' t i s a w o r t h y s u b -\nject thou bringest to discuss.

I wot not, for\n'tis not the kind of tale men like to tell over the\n\f\nThe Gold Lender of Babylon     77\nbronze caster's forge. I will tell it to thee for thou\nshouldst know that to borrowing and lending there\nis more than the passing of gold from the hands of\none to the hands of another.\n\"This farmer, who could understand what the ani-\nmals said to each other, did linger in the farm yard\neach evening just to listen to their words. One eve-\nning he did hear the ox bemoaning to the ass the\nhardness of his lot: 'I do labour pulling the plow from\nmorning until night.

When night came and he was released from\nthe plow his heart was bitter and his legs were weary\nand his neck was sore where the bow had chafed it.\n\"The farmer lingered in the barnyard to listen.\n\f\n78     THE RICHEST MAN IN BABYLON\n\"The ox began first. 'You are my good friend. Be-\ncause of your wise advice I have enjoyed a day of\nrest.'\n\" ' A n d 1 , ’ r e t o r t e d t h e a s s , ' a m l i k e m a n y a n o t h e r\nsimple-hearted one who starts to help a friend and\nends up by doing his task for him.

He placed it upon the floor and\nsquatted before it, both hands upon the lid.\n\"From each person to whom I lend, I do exact a\ntoken for my token chest, to remain there until the\nloan is repaid.

Mathon picked up the piece and\npatted it affectionately. \"This shall always remain in\nmy token chest because the owner has passed on\ni n t o t h e g r e a t d a r k n e s s .

Then would I reply, 'I treasure\nmuch each piece of gold. Were the robbers to take it\nfrom you as you journeyed to Smyrna or take the\nrugs from you as you returned, then you would have\nno means of repaying me and my gold would be\ngone.'\n\"Gold, you see, Rodan, is the merchandise of the\nlender of money. It is easy to lend. If it is lent un-\nwisely then it is difficult to get back.

And now the walls must\nhold or Babylon was doomed.\n89\n\f\n90     THE RICHEST MAN IN BABYLON\nAbout Banzar were great crowds of citizens, white-\nfaced and terrified, eagerly seeking news of the bat-\ntle. With hushed awe they viewed the stream of\nwounded and dead being carried or led out of the\npassageway.\nHere was the crucial point of attack. After three\ndays of circling about the city, the enemy had sud-\ndenly thrown his great strength against this section\nand this gate.\nThe defenders from the top of the wall fought off\nthe climbing platforms and the scaling ladders of the\na t t a c k e r s w i t h a r r o w s , b u r n i n g o i l a n d , i f a n y r e a c h e d\nthe top, spears. Against the defenders, thousands of\nthe enemy's archers poured a deadly barrage of\narrows.\nOld Banzar had the vantage point for news. He\nwas closest to the conflict and first to hear of each\nfresh repulse of the frenzied attackers.\nAn elderly merchant crowded close to him, his pal-\nsied hands quivering. \"Tell me! Tell me!\" he pleaded.\n\"They cannot get in. My sons are with the good king.\nThere is no one to protect my old wife. My goods,\nthey will steal all. My food, they will leave nothing.\nWe are old, too old to defend ourselves—too old for\n slaves. We shall starve. We shall die. Tell me they\ncannot get in.\"\n\"Calm thyself, good merchant,\" the guard re-\nsponded. \"The walls of Babylon are strong. Go back\nto the bazaar and tell your wife that the walls will\nprotect you and all of your possessions as safely as\nthey protect the rich treasures of the king. Keep close\nto the walls, lest the arrows flying over strike you!\"\nA woman with a babe in arms took the old man's\nplace as he withdrew. \"Sergeant, what news from\nt h e t o p ?

As, with clanking bronze\nshields and heavy tread, they tramped by, a small\ngirl plucked at his girdle.\n\"Tell me please, soldier, are we safe.?\" she pleaded.\n\"I hear the awful noises. I see the men all bleeding.\nI am so frightened. What will become of our family,\nof my mother, little brother and the baby?\"\nThe grim old campaigner blinked his eyes and\nthrust forward his chin as he beheld the child.\n\"Be not afraid, little one,\" he reassured her. \"The\nwalls of Babylon will protect you and mother and\nl i t t l e b r o t h e r a n d t h e b a b y .

Harder and grimmer\nset the jaw of Banzar as the passage behind, wet with\nthe blood of the many wounded, was churned into\nmud by the never-ceasing streams of men passing\nup and staggering down. Each day the slaughtered\nattackers piled up in heaps before the wall. Each\nnight they were carried back and buried by their\ncomrades.\nUpon the fifth night of the fourth week the clamour\nwithout diminished. The first streaks of daylight, illu-\nminating the plains, disclosed great clouds of dust\nraised by the retreating armies.\nA mighty shout went up from the defenders. There\nwas no mistaking its meaning. It was repeated by\nthe waiting troops behind the walls. It was echoed\nby the citizens upon the streets. It swept over the\ncity with the violence of a storm.\nPeople rushed from the houses. The streets were\njammed with a throbbing mob.

It could not afford to be otherwise.\nThe walls of Babylon were an outstanding example\nof man's need and desire for protection. This desire\nis inherent in the human race.

    "raw_text": "The Camel Trader of\nBabylon\nThe hungrier one becomes, the clearer one's mind\nworks—also the more sensitive one becomes to the\nodours of food.\nTarkad, the son of Azure, certainly thought so. For\ntwo whole days he had tasted no food except two\nsmall figs purloined from over the wall of a garden.\nNot another could he grab before the angry woman\nrushed forth and chased him down the street. Her\nshrill cries were still ringing in his ears as he walked\nthrough the marketplace. They helped him to restrain\nhis restless fingers from snatching the tempting fruits\nfrom the baskets of the market women.\nNever before had he realized how much food was\nbrought to the markets of Babylon and how good it\nsmelled. Leaving the market, he walked across to the\ninn and paced back and forth in front of the eating\nhouse. Perhaps here he might meet someone he\nknew; someone from whom he could borrow a cop-\nper that would gain him a smile from the unfriendly\nkeeper of the inn and, with it, a liberal helping. With-\n94\n\f\nThe Camel Trader of Babylon 95\nout the copper he knew all too well how unwelcome\nhe would be.\nIn his abstraction he unexpectedly found himself\nface to face with the one man he wished most to\na v o i d , t h e t a l l b o n y f i g u r e o f D a b a s i r , t h e c a m e l\ntrader. Of all the friends and others from whom he\nh a d b o r r o w e d s m a l l s u m s , D a b a s i r m a d e h i m f e e l\nthe most uncomfortable because of his failure to keep\nhis promises to repay promptly.\nD a b a s i r ' s f a c e l i g h t e d u p a t t h e s i g h t o f h i m . \" H a !\n' T i s T a r k a d , j u s t t h e o n e I h a v e b e e n s e e k i n g t h a t h e\nmight repay the two pieces of copper which I lent\nhim a moon ago; also the piece of silver which I lent\nt o h i m b e f o r e t h a t . W e a r e w e l l m e t . I c a n m a k e g o o d\nuse of the coins this very day. What say, boy?\nWhat say?\"\nTarkad stuttered and his face flushed. He had\nnaught in his empty stomach to nerve him to argue\nwith the outspoken Dabasir. \"I am sorry, very sorry,\"\nhe mumbled weakly, \"but this day I have neither the\ncopper nor the silver with which I could repay.\"\n\" T h e n g e t i t , \" D a b a s i r i n s i s t e d . \" S u r e l y t h o u c a n s t\ng e t h o l d o f a f e w c o p p e r s a n d a p i e c e o f s i l v e r t o\nrepay the generosity of an old friend of thy father\nwho aided thee whenst thou wast in need?\"\n\" ' T i s b e c a u s e i l l f o r t u n e d o e s p u r s u e m e t h a t I\ncannot pay.\"\n\"Ill fortune!

I a m h u n g r y a n d I w o u l d t e l l t h e e\na tale.\"\nTarkad flinched from the brutal frankness of Da-\nbasir, but here at least was an invitation to enter the\ncoveted doorway of the eating house.\n\f\n96     The RICHEST MAN IN BABYLON\nDabasir pushed him to a far corner of the room\nwhere they seated themselves upon small rugs.\nWhen Kauskor, the proprietor, appeared smiling,\nDabasir addressed him with his usual freedom, \"Fat\nl i z a r d o f t h e d e s e r t , b r i n g t o m e a l e g o f t h e g o a t ,\nvery brown with much juice, and bread and all of\nthe vegetables for I am hungry and want much food.\nDo not forget my friend here. Bring to him a jug of\nwater. Have it cooled, for the day is hot.\"\nTarkad's heart sank. Must he sit here and drink\nwater while he watched this man devour an entire\ngoat leg? He said nothing. He thought of nothing he\ncould say.\nDabasir, however, knew no such thing as silence.\nSmiling and waving his hand good-naturedly to the\nother customers, all of whom knew him, he con-\ntinued.\n\"I did hear from a traveller just returned from Urfa\no f a c e r t a i n r i c h m a n w h o h a s a p i e c e o f s t o n e c u t\nso thin that one can look through it. He put it in the\nwindow of his house to keep out the rains. It is yel-\nlow, so this traveller does relate, and he was permit-\nted to look through it and all the outside world\nlooked strange and not like-it really is. What say you\nto that, Tarkad? Thinkest all the world could look to\na man a different colour from what it is?\"\n\"I dare say,\" responded the youth, much more in-\nterested in the fat leg of goat placed before Dabasir.\n\" W e l l , I k n o w i t t o b e t r u e f o r I m y s e l f h a v e s e e n\nthe world all of a different colour from what it really\ni s a n d t h e t a l e I a m a b o u t t o t e l l r e l a t e s h o w I c a m e\nto see it in its right colour once more.\"\n\"Dabasir will tell a tale,\" whispered a neighbouring\ndiner to his neighbour, and dragged his rug close.\nOther diners brought their food and crowded in a\n\f\nThe Camel Trader of Babylon 97\nsemicircle. They crunched noisily in the ears of Tar-\nkad and brushed him with their meaty bones. He\nalone was without food. Dabasir did not offer to\nshare with him nor even motion him to a small cor-\nner of the hard bread that was broken off and had\nfallen from the platter to the floor.\n\" T h e t a l e t h a t I a m a b o u t t o t e l l , \" b e g a n D a b a s i r ,\npausing to bite a goodly chunk from the goat leg,\n\" r e l a t e s t o m y e a r l y l i f e a n d h o w I c a m e t o b e a\ncamel trader.

Being young and not greatly skilled, I could\nearn but little, just enough to support my excellent\nwife in a modest way. I craved good things which I\ncould not afford. Soon I found that the shopkeepers\nwould trust me to pay later even though I could not\npay at the time.\n\"Being young and without experience I did not\nknow that he who spends more than he earns is sow-\ning the winds of needless self-indulgence from which\nhe is sure to reap the whirlwinds of trouble and hu-\nmiliation. So I indulged my whims for fine raiment\nand bought luxuries for my good wife and our home,\nbeyond our means.\n\" I p a i d a s I c o u l d a n d f o r a w h i l e a l l w e n t w e l l .\nBut in time I discovered I could not use my earnings\nboth to live upon and to pay my debts. Creditors\nbegan to pursue me to pay for my extravagant pur-\nchases and my life became miserable. I borrowed\n\f\n98     THE RICHEST MAN IN BABYLON\nfrom my friends, but could not repay them either.\nThings went from bad to worse. My wife returned\nto her father and I decided to leave Babylon and\nseek another city where a young man might have\nbetter chances.\n\" F o r t w o y e a r s I h a d a r e s t l e s s a n d u n s u c c e s s f u l\nlife working for caravan traders. From this I fell in\nw i t h a s e t o f l i k a b l e r o b b e r s w h o s c o u r e d t h e d e s e r t\nfor unarmed caravans. Such deeds were unworthy of\nthe son of my father, but I was seeing the world\nthrough a coloured stone and did not realize to what\ndegradation I had fallen.\n\"We met with success on our first trip, capturing\na rich haul of gold and silks and valuable merchan-\ndise. This loot we took to Ginir and squandered.\n\"The second time we were not so fortunate. Just\nafter we had made our capture, we were attacked by\nt h e s p e a r s m e n o f a n a t i v e c h i e f t o w h o m t h e c a r a v a n s\npaid for protection. Our two leaders were killed, and\nt h e r e s t o f u s w e r e t a k e n t o D a m a s c u s w h e r e w e\nwere stripped of our clothing and sold as slaves.\n\" I w a s p u r c h a s e d f o r t w o p i e c e s o f s i l v e r b y a S y r -\nian desert chief. With my hair shorn and but a loin-\nc l o t h t o w e a r , I w a s n o t s o d i f f e r e n t f r o m t h e o t h e r\nslaves. Being a reckless youth, I thought it merely an\nadventure until my master took me before his four\nwives and told them they could have me for a\neunuch.\n\"Then, indeed, did I realize the hopelessness of my\nsituation. These men of the desert were fierce and\nwarlike. I was subject to their will without weapons\nor means of escape.\n\"Fearful I stood, as those four women looked me\nover. I wondered if I could expect pity from them.\nS i r a , t h e f i r s t w i f e , w a s o l d e r t h a n t h e o t h e r s . H e r\n\f\nThe Camel trader of Babylon 99\nface was impassive as she looked upon me. I turned\nfrom her with little consolation. The next was a con-\ntemptuous beauty who gazed at me as indifferently\na s i f I h a d b e e n a w o r m o f t h e e a r t h . T h e t w o\nyounger ones tittered as though it were all an excit-\ning joke.\n\" I t s e e m e d a n a g e t h a t 1 s t o o d w a i t i n g s e n t e n c e .\nEach woman appeared willing for the others to de-\ncide. Finally Sira spoke up in a cold voice.\n\" 'Of eunuchs we have plenty, but of camel tenders\nw e h a v e f e w a n d t h e y a r e a w o r t h l e s s l o t . E v e n t h i s\nday I would visit my mother who is sick with the\nfever and there is no slave I would trust to lead my\ncamel. Ask this slave if he can lead a camel.'\n\"My master thereupon questioned me, 'What\nknow you of camels?'\n\"Striving to conceal my eagerness, I replied, 'I can\nm a k e t h e m k n e e l , I c a n l o a d t h e m , I c a n l e a d t h e m\non long trips without tiring.

' I f t h o u s o d e s i r e , S i r a , t a k e t h i s m a n f o r t h y\ncamel tender.'\n\"So I was turned over to Sira and that day 1 led\nher camel upon a long journey to her sick mother. I\ntook the occasion to thank her for her intercession\na n d a l s o t o t e l l h e r t h a t I w a s n o t a s l a v e b y b i r t h ,\nbut the son of a freeman, an honourable saddle-maker\nof Babylon. I also told her much of my story. Her\ncomments were disconcerting to me and 1 pondered\nmuch afterward on what she said.\n\" 'How can you call yourself a free man when your\nweakness has brought you to this? If a man has in\nhimself the soul of a slave will he not become one no\nmatter what his birth, even as water seeks its level?

One\nday Sira asked me, 'In the even time when the other\nslaves can mingle and enjoy the society of each other,\nwhy dost thou sit in thy tent alone?'\n\"To which I responded, 'I am pondering what you\nh a v e s a i d t o m e . I w o n d e r i f I h a v e t h e s o u l o f a\nslave. I cannot join them, so I must sit apart.'\n\" T, too, must sit apart,' she confided.

' I a s k e d\nher suddenly. 'Have I the soul of a man or have I\nthe soul of a slave?'\n\" 'Have you a desire to repay the just debts you\nowe in Babylon?' she parried.\n\" 'Yes, I have the desire, but I see no way.'\n\"If thou contentedly let the years slip by and make\nno effort to repay, then thou hast but the contempt-\nible soul of a slave. No man is otherwise who cannot\nrespect himself and no man can respect himself who\ndoes not repay honest debts.'\n\" 'But what can I do who am a slave in Syria?'\n\" 'Stay a slave in Syria, thou weakling.'\n\" 'I am not a weakling,' I denied hotly.\n\" 'Then prove it.'\n\" 'How?'\n\f\nThe Camel Trader of Babylon 101\n\" 'Does not thy great king fight his enemies in\nevery way he can and with every force he has?

Three days later the maid of Sira took\nme to her mistress.\nn 'My mother is again very sick,’ she said. 'Saddle\nthe two best camels in my husband's herd. Tie on\nwater skins and saddlebags for a long journey. The\nmaid will give thee food at the kitchen tent.'

The maid rode the rear\nc a m e l w h i c h f o l l o w e d a n d I l e d t h e c a m e l o f m y\nmistress. When we reached her mother's house it was\njust dark.

There was a cool-\nness in the morning air. My camels lay dejected not\nfar away.

Yes it was so. Why\nhad I refused to stand my ground like a man? Why\nhad I permitted my wife to go back to her father?\n\"Then a strange thing happened. All the world\nseemed to be of a different colour as though I had\nbeen looking at it through a coloured stone which had\nsuddenly been removed. At last I saw the true values\nin life.\n\" D i e i n t h e d e s e r t ! N o t I ! W i t h a n e w v i s i o n , I s a w\nthe things that I must do.

I should tell them that after years of\nwandering and misfortune, I had come back to pay\nmy debts as fast as the Gods would permit. Next I\nshould make a home for my wife and become a citi-\nzen of whom my parents should be proud.\n\f\n104     THE RICHEST MAN IN BABYLON\n\"My debts were my enemies, but the men I owed\nwere my friends for they had trusted me and be-\nlieved in me.\n\"I staggered weakly to my feet.

B e i n g a\ncollege professor, I am supposed to be a thinking\nhuman being possessing a working knowledge\nof most subjects. Yet, here comes this old chap out\nof the dust-covered ruins of Babylon to offer a\nway I had never heard of to pay off my debts and\nat the same time acquire gold to jingle in my\nwallet.\nPleasant thought, I say, and interesting to prove\nwhether it will work as well nowadays as it did\nin old Babylon. Mrs. Shrewsbury and myself are\nplanning to try out his plan upon our own\naffairs which could be much improved.\nWishing you the best of luck in your worthy\nundertaking and waiting eagerly another\nopportunity to assist, I am,\nYours sincerely,\nAlfred H. Shrewsbury,\nDepartment of Archaeology.\nTABLET ONE\nNow, when the moon becometh full, I, Dabasir, who\nam but recently returned from slavery in Syria,\nwith the determination to pay my many just debts\nand become a man of means worthy of respect in my\n\f\n108     THE RICHEST MAN IN BABYLON\nnative city of Babylon, do here engrave upon the\nclay a permanent record of my affairs to guide and\nassist me in carrying through my high desires.\nUnder the wise advice of my good friend Mathon,\nthe gold lender,-I am determined to follow an exact\nplan that he doth say will lead any honourable man\nout of debt into means and self-respect.\nThis plan includeth three purposes which are my\nhope and desire.\nFirst, the plan doth provide for my future prosperity.\nTherefore one-tenth of all I earn shall be set aside\nas my own to keep. For Mathon speaketh wisely\nwhen he saith:\n\"That man who keepeth in his purse both gold and\nsilver that he need not spend is good to his family\nand loyal to his king.\n\"The man who hath but a few coppers in his purse\nis indifferent to his family and indifferent to his\nking.\n\"But the man who hath naught in his purse is\nunkind to his family and is disloyal to his king, for\nhis own heart is bitter.\n\"Therefore, the man who wisheth to achieve must\nhave coin that he may keep to jingle in his purse,\nthat he have in his heart love for his family and loyalty\nto his king.\"\nSecond, the plan doth provide that I shall support\nand clothe my good wife who hath returned to me\nwith loyalty from the house of her father. For Mathon\ndoth say that to take good care of a faithful wife\nputteth self-respect into the heart of a man and addeth\nstrength and determination to his purposes.\nTherefore seven-tenths of all I earn shall be used to\nprovide a home, clothes to wear, and food to eat, with\na bit extra to spend, that our lives be not lacking in\npleasure and enjoyment. But he doth further enjoin the\ngreatest care that we spend not greater than seven-tenth\n\f\nThe Clay Tablets from Babylon 109\nof what I earn for these worthy purposes. Herein lieth\nthe success of the plan. I must live upon this portion\nand never use more nor buy what I may not pay for\nout of this portion.\nTABLET TWO\nThird, the plan doth provide that out of my earnings\nmy 'debts shall be paid.\nTherefore each time the moon is full, two-tenths of\nall I have earned shall be divided honourably and\nfairly among those who have trusted me and to whom\nI am indebted. Thus in due time will all my\nindebtedness be surely paid.\nTherefore, do I here engrave the name of every man\nto whom I am indebted and the honest amount of\nmy debt.\nFahru. the cloth weaver, 2 silver, 6 copper.\nShi jar, the couch maker, 1 silver.   .\nAhmar, my friend, 3 silver, 1 copper.\nZankar, my friend, 4 silver, 7 copper.\nAskamir, my friend, 1 silver, 3 copper.\nHarinsir, the jewelmaker, 6 silver, 2 copper.\nDiarbeker, my father's friend, 4 silver, 1 copper.\nAlkahad, the house owner, 14 silver.\nMathon, the gold lender, 9 silver.\nBirejik, the farmer, I silver, 7 copper.\n(From here on, disintegrated. Cannot be deciphered.)\n\f\n110     THE RICHEST MAN IN BABYLON\nTABLET THREE\nTo these creditors do I owe in total one hundred\nand nineteen pieces of silver and one hundred and\nforty-one pieces of copper. Because I did owe these\nsums and saw no way to repay, in my folly I did\npermit my wife to return to her father and didst leave\nmy native city and seek easy wealth elsewhere, only\nto find disaster and to see myself sold into the\ndegradation of slavery.\nNow that Mathon doth show me how I can repay\nmy debts in small sums of my earnings, do I realize\nthe great extent of my folly in running away from the\nresults of my extravagances.\nTherefore have I visited my creditors and explained\nto them that I have no resources with which to pay\nexcept my ability to earn, and that I intend to apply\ntwo-tenths of all I earn upon my indebtedness evenly\nand honestly. This much can I pay but no more.\nTherefore if they be patient, in time my obligations\nwill be paid in full.\nAhmar, whom I thought my best friend, reviled me\nbitterly and I left him in humiliation. Birejik, the\nfarmer, pleaded that I pay him first as he didst badly\nneed help. Alkahad, the house owner, was indeed\ndisagreeable and insisted that he would make me\ntrouble unless I didst soon settle in full with him.\nAll the rest willingly accepted my proposal.\nTherefore am I more determined than ever to carry\nthrough, being convinced that it is easier to pay one's\njust debts than to avoid them. Even though I cannot\nmeet the needs and demands of a few of my creditors\nI will deal impartially with all.\n\f\nThe Clay Tablets from Babylon 111\nTABLET FOUR\nAgain the moon shines full. I have worked hard\nwith a free mind. My good wife hath supported\nmy intentions to pay my creditors. Because of our\nwise determination, I have earned during the\npast moon, buying camels of sound wind and good\nlegs, for Nebatur, the sum of nineteen pieces of\nsilver.\nThis I have divided according to the plan. One-tenth\nhave I set aside to keep as my own, seven-tenths\nhave I divided with my good wife to pay for our living.\nTwo-tenths have I divided among my creditors as\nevenly as could be done in coppers.\nI did not see Ahmar but left it with his wife. Birejik\nwas so pleased he would kiss my hand. Old Alkahad\nalone was grouchy and said I must pay faster. To\nwhich I replied that if I were permitted to be well\nfed and not worried, that alone would enable me to\npay faster. All the others thanked me and spoke well\nof my efforts.\nTherefore, at the end of one moon, my indebtedness\nis reduced by almost four pieces of silver and I\npossess almost two pieces of silver besides, upon which\nno man hath claim. My heart is lighter than it\nhath been for a long time.\nAgain the moon shines full I have worked hard but\nwith poor success. Few camels have I been able to\nbuy. Only eleven pieces of silver have I earned.\nNevertheless my good wife and I have stood by the\nplan even though we have bought no new raiment and\neaten little but herbs. Again I paid ourselves one-\ntenth of the eleven pieces, while we lived upon seven-\ntenths. I was surprised when Ahmar commended\nmy payment, even though small. So did Birejik.\nAlkahad flew into a rage but when told to give back\n\f\n112     THE RICHEST MAN IN BABYLON\nhis portion if he did not wish it, he became reconciled.\nThe others, as before, were content.\nAgain the moon shines full and I am greatly\nrejoiced, I intercepted a fine herd of camels and\nbought many sound ones, therefore my earnings were\nforty-two pieces of silver. This moon my wife and\nmyself have bought much needed sandals and raiment.\nAlso we have dined well on meat and fowl.\nMore than eight pieces of silver we have paid to our\ncreditors. Even Alkahad did not protest.\nGreat is the plan for it leadeth us out of debt and\ngiveth us wealth which is ours to keep.\nThree times the moon had been full since I last\ncarved upon this clay. Each time I paid to myself\none-tenth of all I earned. Each time my good wife and\nI have lived upon seven-tenths even though at times\nit was difficult. Each time have I paid to my creditors\ntwo-tenths.\nIn my purse I now have twenty-one pieces of silver\nthat are mine. It maketh my head to stand straight\nupon my shoulders and maketh me proud to walk\namong my friends.\nMy wife keepeth well our home and is becomingly\ngowned. We are happy to live together.\nThe plan is of untold value. Hath it not made an\nhonourable man of an ex-slave?\nTABLET FIVE\nAgain the moon shines full und I remember that it\nis long since I carved upon the clay. Twelve moons\nin truth have come and gone. But this day I will not\nneglect my record because upon this day I have\nPaid the last of my debts. This is the day upon which\nmy good wife and my thankful self celebrate with"

If thou needst silver or gold at any time come\nto me.\"\nNor is he the only one who holdeth me in high\nregard. Many others speak deferentially to me.

It hath\nenabled me to pay all my debts and to jingle both\ngold and silver in my purse. I do commend it to all\nwho wish to get ahead. For truly if it will enable\nan ex-slave to pay his debts and have gold in his purse,\nwill it not aid any man to find independence? Nor\nam I, myself, finished with it, for I am convinced that\nif I follow it further it will make me rich among\nmen.\n\f\n114     THE RICHEST MAN IN BABYLON\nST. SWITHIN'S COLLEGE\nNottingham University\nNewark- on-Trent\nNottingham\nNovember 7, 1936.\nProfessor Franklin Caldwell,\nCare of British Scientific Expedition,\nHillah, Mesopotamia.\nMy dear Professor:\nIf, in your further digging into those ruins of\nBabylon, you encounter the ghost of a former\nresident, an old camel trader named Dabasir, do\nme a favour. Tell him that his scribbling upon\nthose clay tablets, so long ago, has earned for him\nthe lifelong gratitude of a couple of college folks\nback here in England.\nYou will possibly remember my writing a year\nago that Mrs. Shrewsbury and myself intended\nto try his plan for getting out of debt and at the\nsame time having gold to jingle. You may have\nguessed, even though we tried to keep it from our\nfriends, our desperate straits.\nWe were frightfully humiliated for years by a\nlot of old debts 'and worried sick for fear some\nof the trades people might start a scandal that\nwould force me out of the college. We paid and\npaid—every shilling we could squeeze out of\nincome—but it was hardly enough to hold things\neven. Besides we were forced to do all our buying\nwhere we could get further credit regardless of\nhigher costs.\nIt developed into one of those vicious circles that\ngrow worse instead of better. Our struggles\nwere getting hopeless. We could not move to less\ncostly rooms because we owed the landlord.\nThere did not appear to be anything we could do\nto improve our situation.\nThen,    here    comes    your     acquaintance,   the     old\n\f\nThe-Clay Tablets from Babylon 115\ncamel trader from Babylon, with a plan to do\njust what we wished to accomplish. He jolly well\nstirred us up to follow his system. We made a\nlist of all our debts and I took it around and\nshowed it to every one we owed.\nI explained how it was simply impossible for me\nto ever pay them the way things were going\nalong. They could readily see this themselves from\nthe figures. Then I explained that the only way\nI saw to pay in full was to set aside twenty percent\nof my income each month to be divided pro\nrata, which would pay them in full in a little over\ntwo years. That, in the meantime, we would go\non a cash basis and give them the further benefit\nof our cash purchases.\nThey were really quite decent. Our greengrocer,\na wise old chap, put it in a way that helped to\nbring around the rest. \"If you pay for all you buy\nand then pay some An what you owe, that is\nbetter than you have done, for ye ain't paid down\nthe account none in three years.\"\nFinally I secured all their names to an\nagreement binding them not to molest us as\nlong as the twenty percent of income was paid\nregularly. Then we began scheming on how to\nlive upon seventy percent. We were determined to\nkeep that extra ten percent to jingle. The\nthought of silver and possibly gold was most\nalluring.\nIt was like having an adventure to make the\nchange. We enjoyed figuring this way and that,\nto live comfortably upon that remaining seventy\npercent. We started with rent and managed to\nsecure a fair reduction. Next we put our favourite\nbrands of tea and such under suspicion and\nwere agreeably surprised how often we could\npurchase superior qualities at less cost.\nIt is too long a story for a letter but anyhow it\ndid not prove difficult. We managed and right\ncheerfully at that. What a relief it proved to have\nour affairs in such a shape we were no longer\npersecuted by past due accounts."

Now\ndon't laugh too soon. You see, that is the sporty\npart. It is the real fun, to start accumulating\nmoney that you do not want to spend. There is\nmore pleasure in running up such a surplus than\nthere could be in spending it.\nAfter we had jingled to our hearts' content, we\nfound a more profitable use for it. We took up\nan investment upon which we could pay that ten\npercent each month. This is proving to be the\nmost satisfying part of our regeneration. It is the\nfirst thing we pay out of my check.\nThere is a most gratifying sense of security to\nknow our investment is growing steadily.

Its very name conjures visions\nof wealth and splendour. Its treasures of gold and jew-\nels were fabulous.

All of the resources supporting this large city\nwere man-developed.

    "raw_text": "140    THE RICHEST MAN IN BABYLON\nDotting this valley are earthen hills. For centuries,\nthey were considered by travellers to be nothing else.\nThe attention of archaeologists were finally attracted\nto them because of broken pieces of pottery and brick\nwashed down by the occasional rainstorms. Expedi-\ntions, financed by European and American museums,\nw e r e s e n t h e r e t o e x c a v a t e a n d s e e w h a t c o u l d b e\nfound. Picks and shovels soon proved these hills to\nbe ancient cities. City graves, they might well be\ncalled.\nBabylon was one of these. Over it for something\nlike twenty centuries, the winds had scattered the\ndesert dust. Built originally of brick, all exposed\nwalls had disintegrated and gone back to earth once\nmore. Such is Babylon, the wealthy city, today. A\nheap of dirt, so long abandoned that no living person\neven knew its name until it was discovered by care-\nfully removing the refuse of centuries from the\nstreets and the fallen wreckage of its noble temples\nand palaces.\nMany scientists consider the civilization of Babylon\nand other cities in this valley to be the oldest of which\nthere is a definite record. Positive dates have been\nproved reaching back 8000 years. An interesting fact in\nthis connection is the means used to determine these\ndates. Uncovered in the ruins of Babylon were de-\nscriptions of an eclipse of the sun. Modern astrono-\nmers readily computed the time when such an\neclipse, visible in Babylon, occurred and thus estab-\nlished a known relationship between their calendar\nand our own.\nIn this way, we have proved that 8000 years ago,\nthe Sumerites, who inhabited Babylonia, were living\nin walled cities. One can only conjecture for how\n\f\nAn Historical Sketch of Babylon 141\nmany centuries previous such cities had existed.\nTheir inhabitants were not mere barbarians living\nwithin protecting walls. They were an educated and\nenlightened people. So far as written history goes,\nthey were the first engineers, the first astronomers,\nthe first mathematicians, the first financiers and the\nfirst people to have a written language.\nMention has already been made of the irrigation\nsystems which transformed the arid valley into an\nagricultural paradise. The remains of these canals can\nstill be traced, although they are mostly filled with\na c c u m u l a t e d s a n d . S o m e o f t h e m w e r e o f s u c h s i z e\nthat, when empty of water, a dozen horses could be\nridden abreast along their bottoms. In size they com-\npare favourably with the largest canals in Colourado\nand Utah.\nIn addition to irrigating the valley lands, Babylo-\nnian engineers completed another project of similar\nmagnitude. By means of an elaborate drainage sys-\nt e m t h e y r e c l a i m e d a n i m m e n s e a r e a o f s w a m p l a n d\nat the mouths of the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers and\nput this also under cultivation.\nHerodotus, the Greek traveller and historian, visited\nBabylon while it was in its prime and has given us the\nonly known description by an outsider. His writings\ngive a graphic description of the city and some of the\nunusual customs of its people. He mentions the re-\nmarkable fertility of the soil and the bountiful harvest\nof wheat and barley which they produced.\nThe glory of Babylon has faded but its wisdom has\nb e e n p r e s e r v e d f o r u s . F o r t h i s w e a r e i n d e b t e d t o\ntheir form of records. In that distant day, the use of\npaper had not been invented. Instead, they labori-\nously engraved their writing upon tablets of moist\n\f\n142     THE RICHEST MAN IN BABYLON\nclay. When completed, these were baked and became\nhard tile. In size, they were about six by eight inches,\nand an inch in thickness.\nThese clay tablets, as they are commonly called,\nwere used much as we use modern forms of writing.\nUpon them were engraved legends, poetry, history,\ntranscriptions of royal decrees, the laws of the land,\ntitles to property, promissory notes and even letters\nwhich were dispatched by messengers to distant\nc i t i e s . F r o m t h e s e c l a y t a b l e t s w e a r e p e r m i t t e d a n\ni n s i g h t i n t o t h e i n t i m a t e , p e r s o n a l a f f a i r s o f t h e p e o -\nple. For example, one tablet, evidently from the re-\ncords of a country storekeeper, relates that upon the\ngiven date a certain named customer brought in a\ncow and exchanged it for seven sacks of wheat, three\nbeing delivered at the time and the other four to\nawait the customer's pleasure.\nSafely buried in the wrecked cities, archaeologists\nhave recovered entire libraries of these tablets, hun-\ndreds of thousands of them.\nOne of the outstanding wonders of Babylon was\nthe immense walls surrounding the city. The ancients\nranked them with the great pyramid of Egypt as be-\nlonging to the \"seven wonders of the world.\" Queen\nSemiramis is credited with having erected the first\nwalls during the early history of the city. Modern\nexcavators have been unable to find any trace of the\noriginal walls. Nor is their exact height known. From\nmention made by early writers, it is estimated they\nwere about fifty to sixty feet high, faced on the outer\nside with burnt brick and further protected by a deep\nmoat of water.\nThe later and more famous walls were started\nabout six hundred years before the time of Christ by\nKing Nabopolassar. Upon such a gigantic scale did\n\f\nAn Historical Sketch of Babylon 143\nhe plan the rebuilding, he did not live to see the\nwork finished. This was left to his son, Nebuchadnez-\nzar, whose name is familiar in Biblical history.\nThe height and length of these later walls staggers\nbelief. They are reported upon reliable authority to\nhave been about one hundred and sixty feet high,\nthe equivalent of the height of a modern fifteen story\noffice building. The total length is estimated as be-\ntween nine and eleven miles. So wide was the top\nthat a six-horse chariot could be driven around them.\nOf this tremendous structure, little now remains ex-\ncept portions of the foundations and the moat. In\naddition to the ravages of the elements, the Arabs\ncompleted the destruction by quarrying the brick for\nbuilding purposes elsewhere.\nAgainst the walls of Babylon marched, in turn, the\nvictorious armies of almost every conqueror of that\nage of wars of conquest. A host of kings laid siege\nto Babylon, but always in vain. Invading armies of\nthat day were not to be considered lightly. Historians\nspeak of such units as 10,000 horsemen, 25,000 chari-\nots, 1200 regiments of foot soldiers with 1000 men to\nthe regiment. Often two or three years of preparation\nw o u l d b e r e q u i r e d t o a s s e m b l e w a r m a t e r i a l s a n d\ndepots of food along the proposed line of march.\nThe city of Babylon was organized much like a mod-\nern city. There were streets and shops. Peddlers offered\ntheir wares through residential districts. Priests offici-\nated in magnificent temples. Within the city was an\ninner enclosure for the royal palaces. The walls about\nthis were said to have been higher than those about\nthe city.\nThe Babylonians were skilled in the arts. These in-\ncluded sculpture, painting, weaving, gold working\nand the manufacture of metal weapons and agricul-\n\f\n144     THE RICHEST MAN IN BABYLON\ntural implements. Their jewelers created most artistic\njewelry. Many samples have been recovered from the\ngraves of its wealthy citizens and are now on exhibi-\ntion in the leading museums of the world.\nA t a v e r y e a r l y p e r i o d w h e n t h e r e s t o f t h e w o r l d\nw a s s t i l l h a c k i n g a t t r e e s w i t h s t o n e - h e a d e d a x e s , o r\nhunting and fighting with flint-pointed spears and\narrows, the Babylonians were using axes, spears and\narrows with metal heads.\nThe Babylonians were clever financiers and traders.\nSo far as we know, they were the original inventors\nof money as a means of exchange, of promissory\nnotes and written titles to property.\nBabylon was never entered by hostile armies until\nabout 540 years before the birth of Christ. Even then\nthe walls were not captured. The story of the fall\nof Babylon is most unusual. Cyrus, one of the great\nconquerors of that period, intended to attack the city\nand hoped to take its impregnable walls. Advisors of\nNabonidus, the King of Babylon, persuaded him to\ngo forth to meet Cyrus and give him battle without\nwaiting for the city to be besieged. In the succeeding\ndefeat to the Babylonian army, it fled away from the\ncity. Cyrus, thereupon, entered the open gates and\ntook possession without resistance.\nThereafter the power and prestige of the city grad-\nually waned until, in the course of a few hundred\nyears, it was eventually abandoned, deserted, left for\nthe winds and storms to level once again to that de-\nsert earth from which its grandeur had originally\nbeen built. Babylon had fallen, never to rise again,\nbut to it civilization owes much.\nThe eons of time have crumbled to dust the proud\nwalls of its temples, but the wisdom of Babylon\nendures.\n\f\nSIGNET M ENTOR\n(0451)\nBUSINESS SUCCESS\nTHROUGH PERSONAL\nGROWTH\nQUALITY IS FREE\nPhilip B.
