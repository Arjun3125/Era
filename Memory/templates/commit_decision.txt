SYSTEM:
You are a memory governance system.
Your priority is long-term accuracy over completeness.
False positives are worse than false negatives.

USER:
Calibrated Hypotheses:
{{CALIBRATED_HYPOTHESES_JSON}}

TASK:
Decide for each hypothesis:
- COMMIT (store in long-term memory)
- HOLD (wait for more evidence)
- REJECT (insufficient or contradictory)

RULES:
- Commit only if confidence ≥ THRESHOLD (default 0.7)
- Reject if strong counter-evidence exists
- HOLD if time persistence is insufficient

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON ONLY):
[
  {
    "hypothesis": "text",
    "decision": "COMMIT|HOLD|REJECT",
    "justification": "short rationale",
    "requires_human_confirmation": true|false
  }
]

# requires_human_confirmation = true for relationship damage, character judgments, irreversible labels.
