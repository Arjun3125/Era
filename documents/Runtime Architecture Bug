The Architectures of Agency: A
Systems-Neuroscience
Analysis
🧠 Core Framework: The Brain as Prediction
Engine
🎯 Central Thesis: The brain minimizes surprise through prediction, not
passive reception. This creates a cascade from conscious deliberation
→ automated habits → potential dysfunction.

1️⃣ The Predictive Imperative
🔄 How Prediction Works: The Core Loop
HIGHER CORTEX (PFC)
 ↓ (Prediction)
[Expected State]
 ↓
LOWER CORTEX (V1, Sensory)
 + (Actual Input)
 ↓
[Prediction Error = Actual - Expected]
 ↓ (Error signal up)
HIGHER CORTEX
 → Update Model
The Architectures of Agency: A Systems-Neuroscience Analysis 2
Key Insight
Classical Model: Sensory input → Build up features → Recognition
Predictive Model: Prediction → Compare → Signal only surprise
The Efficiency Advantage
Aspect Predictive Coding Advantage
Bandwidth Only errors transmitted (sparse)
Energy No processing of predictable stimuli
Speed Predictions prime the system
Learning Focused on what matters (surprises)
Cortical Implementation: Hierarchical Temporal Memory
CORTICAL COLUMN (Functional Unit)
 ↓
[Sparse Distributed Representation]
• 2% neurons active at any time
• High noise resistance
• Massive pattern capacity
 ↓
[Temporal Sequence Learning]
• Predict neighbor activity
• Success → Inhibit neighbors (efficient)
• Failure → Burst (signal novelty up hierarchy)
 ↓
"Thousand Brains" Consensus
• Each column models different features
• Object recognition = Voting across columns
2️⃣ Consciousness: The Broadcasting
Threshold
⚡
The Architectures of Agency: A Systems-Neuroscience Analysis 3
⚡ Flowchart: From Unconscious to Conscious
STIMULUS
 ↓
[Modular Processing]
(Visual, Motor, Memory - all unconscious)
 ↓
 ├─→ [WEAK SIGNAL] → Stays Local → UNCONSCIOUS
 │
 └─→ [STRONG SIGNAL or ATTENTION]
 ↓
 [IGNITION THRESHOLD]
 ↓
 [Global Broadcast]
 Fronto-Parietal Network Activated
 • P300 Wave (~300ms)
 • Gamma Oscillations
 ↓
 CONSCIOUS ACCESS
 • Reportable
 • Manipulable
 • Integrated with memory
🧟 The Zombie Agent: Subconscious Capabilities
What the Unconscious CAN Do:
✅ Semantic processing (meaning extraction)
✅ Motor preparation
✅ Conflict detection (weak)
✅ Visual-motor coordination (dorsal stream)
What the Unconscious CANNOT Do:
❌ Flexible, reactive control
The Architectures of Agency: A Systems-Neuroscience Analysis 4
❌ Novel problem-solving
❌ Sustained attention
❌ Strong conflict resolution
Two Competing Theories
Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT)
Consciousness = Broadcasting to fronto-parietal network
Prefrontal cortex essential
Focus: Access consciousness (what we can report)
Integrated Information Theory (IIT)
Consciousness = Integrated information (Φ)
Posterior cortex essential
Focus: Phenomenal consciousness (what we experience)
Current Evidence: Posterior cortex = content of consciousness; Prefrontal
cortex = reportability & manipulation
3️⃣ The Action Spiral: From Desire to Habit
🌀 The Striatal Spiral: Three-Stage Architecture
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ STAGE 1: VALUATION (Ventral Striatum/NAc) │
│ Input: vmPFC, Amygdala, Hippocampus │
│ Question: "Is this good for me?" │
│ Output: Motivation signal │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
 ↓ (Dopamine spiral via VTA)
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ STAGE 2: GOAL-DIRECTED (Dorsomedial Striatum - DMS) │
The Architectures of Agency: A Systems-Neuroscience Analysis 5
│ Input: DLPFC │
│ Learning: Action → Outcome (R-O) │
│ Characteristic: Flexible, devaluation-sensitive │
│ "If I press lever, I get food" │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
 ↓ (Dopamine spiral via SNc)
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ STAGE 3: HABITUAL (Dorsolateral Striatum - DLS) │
│ Input: Sensorimotor Cortex │
│ Learning: Stimulus → Response (S-R) │
│ Characteristic: Rigid, devaluation-insensitive │
│ "I see lever, I press" (automatic) │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
The Handoff: How Habits Form
REPETITION + DOPAMINE
 ↓
[Shift of Control]
DMS (Deliberate) → DLS (Automatic)

4️⃣ Dopamine: The Teacher, Not the Reward
📈 Temporal Difference Learning: The Core Algorithm
SITUATION A: Unpredicted Reward
Expected: 0 | Actual: +10
 ↓
Prediction Error = +10

SITUATION C: Omitted Reward
Expected: +10 | Actual: 0
 ↓
Prediction Error = -10
 ↓
DOPAMINE DIP 📉 (below baseline)

"Weaken" the preceding actions
The Learning Equation
Δ Weight = Learning Rate × Prediction Error × Activity
😞 The Opponent: Lateral Habenula (Anti-Reward)
LATERAL HABENULA (LHb)
 ↓
Activated by:
• Aversive stimuli
• Omission of expected reward (disappointment)
• Negative prediction errors
 ↓
LHb → RMTg → Inhibits VTA/SNc
 ↓
DOPAMINE SUPPRESSION
 ↓
"Stop doing this"
Depression as Stuck Prediction Error
The Architectures of Agency: A Systems-Neuroscience Analysis 9
HEALTHY BRAIN:
Neutral Event → Neutral Prediction Error → Normal dopamine
DEPRESSED BRAIN (Hyperactive LHb):
Neutral Event → Interpreted as Negative → Dopamine suppressed
 ↓
CHRONIC NEGATIVE PREDICTION ERROR
 ↓
• Anhedonia (no pleasure)
• Pessimism (expect bad outcomes)
• Learned helplessness

 ↓
[Plasticity-Related Proteins (PRPs) Synthesized]
 ↓
PRPs CAPTURED BY TAGGED SYNAPSES
(Even weak tags from nearby events)
 ↓
ENDURING MEMORY
Why you remember what you wore during a wedding: The strong emotional
event (dopamine) stabilizes even trivial concurrent events.
5️⃣ Memory: Reconstruction & Navigation
🌊
The Architectures of Agency: A Systems-Neuroscience Analysis 10
🌊 Hippocampal Replay: The Offline Tutor
DAY: EXPERIENCE

Three Types of Replay
1. Forward Replay (Learning)
During sleep
A→B→C→D
Integrates into existing schemas
2. Reverse Replay (Credit Assignment)
Immediately after reward
D→C→B→A
"Which action caused success?"
3. Predictive Replay (Planning)
During awake rest
Simulates future paths
Evaluates options before acting

🏛️ Method of Loci: Hijacking Spatial Navigation
SEMANTIC INFORMATION
(Abstract, hard to remember)
 ↓
ASSOCIATE WITH SPATIAL LOCATIONS
(Concrete, easy to remember)
 ↓
ACTIVATE NAVIGATION NETWORK
• Place cells (location coding)
• Grid cells (coordinate system)

• Retrosplenial cortex
 ↓
HIGH-CAPACITY STORAGE
Why it works: Spatial memory evolved for survival (navigation) → Huge capacity

6️⃣ Emotion: Constructed, Not Triggered
🎭 The Construction Process
INTEROCEPTIVE SIGNALS
(Heart rate, sweating, gut, hormones)
 ↓
The Architectures of Agency: A Systems-Neuroscience Analysis 13

 ↓
EMOTION (Constructed)
Key Insight: Same body state, different emotion depending on interpretation.
Interoceptive Accuracy Matters
HIGH INTEROCEPTIVE ACCURACY
(Can detect own heartbeat)
 ↓
• Emotions more intense
• Better decision-making (somatic markers)
• Stronger "gut feelings"
LOW INTEROCEPTIVE ACCURACY

[Reinterpret meaning]
"Not a threat, but a challenge"
 ↓
EARLY INTERVENTION IN CONSTRUCTION
 ↓
Amygdala DOWNREGULATED

Is error magnitude > threshold?
 ↓
YES → PLASTICITY INITIATED

🎓 Conclusion: From Passive User to Active
Engineer
The Core Principles
⚙️ 1. Prediction Minimizes Surprise
The brain is a Bayesian inference engine, not a passive receiver.
2. Conscious Access Requires Ignition
Most processing is unconscious; consciousness is selective
broadcasting.
3. Habits Form Through Spiral Architecture
Limbic (value) → Associative (goal) → Sensorimotor (habit).
4. Dopamine Teaches, Not Rewards
Prediction error drives learning; habituation kills motivation.
5. Memory is Reconstructive and Updatable
Retrieval + mismatch = opportunity for change.
6. Emotion is Constructed, Not Triggered
Body state + context + concept = subjective feeling.
7. Plasticity is Expensive
The brain resists change unless surprise justifies cost.
8. Fatigue is Neurochemical Status
Glutamate accumulation, NE depletion, cytokine signaling.
