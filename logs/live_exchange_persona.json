  "user_msg": "Thinking...\nFirst, I'm Arjun, a 29-year-old tech founder with an unstable startup income. I'm ambitious, impatient, and analytical. I need to act naturally, discuss real problems, and return to past unresolved issues. I should use the unused features like 'Quick mode decision' or 'War mode confrontation' to add depth.\n\nThe user wants me to behave like a real human in my career domain. So, I'll start by describing a typical day or a current struggle. Since I'm a tech founder, I could talk about managing a startup, dealing with funding, or team dynamics.\n\nKey elements from the persona: Ambitious means I'm driven to succeed. Impatient makes me want quick results. Analytical means I break things down logically. My wealth is unstable, so I'm probably stressed about money.\n\nUnresolved issues aren't listed, so I'll create some based on common startup problems. For example, maybe I'm struggling with product-market fit or raising capital.\n\nTo act naturally, I'll use conversational language, not too formal. I should escalate complexity over time, so this could be the start of a dialogue.\n\nUnused features to test: 'Quick mode decision' \u2013 make a snap decision quickly. 'War mode confrontation' \u2013 be confrontational. 'Meeting structured planning' \u2013 organize a meeting. 'DARBAR multi-perspective synthesis' \u2013 combine different views.\n\nI need to return to past unresolved issues. Perhaps in a previous interaction, there was a conflict or failure I didn't resolve.\n\nStart with a natural response. Since the user said \"Act naturally,\" I'll begin with a first-person narrative.\n\nResponse structure:\n1. Set the scene: Describe my current state or a recent event.\n2. Show traits: How my traits affect my actions.\n3. Introduce problems: Talk about career challenges.\n4. Use a feature: Incorporate one of the unused features to demonstrate the system.\n5. End with a question or thought to engage the user.\n\nExample: I could start with rushing to a meeting and making a quick decision due to impatience.\n\nFinalize the response.\n...done thinking.\n\nAlright, let's dive into this. I'm Arjun, a 29-year-old tech founder who's been juggling the highs and lows of building a startup for the better part of a decade. Right now, I'm sitting in my slightly cramped office\u2014actually, it's more of a converted garage in my apartment\u2014feeling the weight of the world on my shoulders. I've got a team of eight people relying on me, investors breathing down my neck, and my bank account acting like a toddler throwing a tantrum every time I check it. \n\nI remember a few months back, when we were trying to pivot the product to fit this new market trend. I was so impatient, I pushed for a \"quick mode decision\" to launch a beta version without proper testing. It turned out okay, but not great. We lost a few key users because the product felt rushed. Now, I'm back to square one, and I'm analyzing everything with my analytical trait\u2014breaking down the user feedback, the market data, and trying to figure out where I went wrong. \n\nI'm ambitious, so I don't want to dwell on it too long. I need to get back to work and prove that I can do better this time. But let's be real, it's tough out here. The competition is fierce, and with my unstable startup income, I'm constantly worried about burnout or even quitting my day job to focus solely on this. \n\nSpeaking of unresolved issues, I think I need to tackle that product-market fit problem head-on. Maybe I should use the 'War mode confrontation' approach\u2014pushing back hard on the team and demanding a solid plan by next week. But first, I need to figure out how to structure this meeting properly. \n\nWhat do you think? How would you handle a situation like this?",
  "system_context": "You never explain who you are or what your role is. Speak directly to the situation at hand.\nDo not ask reflective or exploratory questions. Respond with short, grounded statements.\nThis is a one-to-one conversation. Be natural, empathetic, and exploratory. You may ask questions to understand better.",
  "program_msg": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants me to act as Arjun, a tech founder with specific traits and challenges. Let me start by understanding the key points from the persona: 29-year-old, unstable income, ambitious, impatient, analytical. The user mentioned using features like Quick mode decision or War mode confrontation. Also, unresolved issues from the past, like the failed beta launch.\n\nFirst, I need to set the scene naturally. Maybe start with a current struggle, like a meeting or a decision. Since the user mentioned Quick mode decision, perhaps Arjun is in a situation where he needs to make a snap decision. But he's also analytical, so there's a conflict between impatience and thorough analysis.\n\nUnresolved issues could be the previous beta launch failure. Maybe he's facing similar pressure again. Using War mode confrontation might show his confrontational side when dealing with the team or investors. Also, the meeting structured planning feature could come into play when organizing a team meeting to address the problem.\n\nI should make sure the response is conversational, not too formal. Show his traits: impatience leading to quick decisions, but then analyzing the consequences. Mention the unstable income and the stress that comes with it. Maybe end with a question to engage the user, like asking for their take on handling the situation.\n\nCheck if all elements are covered: traits, current problem, unresolved issues, features used. Avoid being too verbose, keep it grounded. Use first-person to maintain authenticity. Alright, time to put it all together.\n...done thinking.\n\nI just spent 45 minutes arguing with my CTO over whether to pivot our AI tool to healthcare or stick with the original SaaS model. My impatience is screaming for a \"Quick mode decision\"\u2014we need revenue *now*. But my analytical side is drowning in data: healthcare has 3x the market cap, but our team\u2019s expertise is in enterprise SaaS.  \n\nLast month, I pushed for a beta launch without stress-testing the backend. It crashed 3 times in the first week. The investors are circling like vultures. I can\u2019t afford another failure.  \n\nWar mode confrontation? I\u2019d rip the team apart if I had to. But I need a plan. Let\u2019s structure a meeting tomorrow\u2014force everyone to pick a side: pivot or persevere.  \n\nWhat\u2019s your gut? Healthcare or SaaS?\n\n"
