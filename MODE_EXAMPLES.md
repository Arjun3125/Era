# Mode Examples: See the Difference

Each mode produces fundamentally different advice for the same question. Here are real-world examples showing how Persona reasons differently.

---

## Example 1: Career Decision

**User Question**: "I've been offered a promotion to VP of Sales. It's prestigious but requires 60+ hour weeks and lots of travel. Currently I have young kids and want to be present. What should I do?"

---

### QUICK MODE Response

```
N: [QUICK] That's a significant crossroads. Let me ask you a few things to understand 
better—what's driving the appeal of this promotion beyond the title? Is it the money, 
the prestige, the learning opportunity, or something else?

And on the flip side, when you imagine yourself 5 years from now looking back, what 
would you most regret—missing time with your kids or missing this career milestone?

These aren't rhetorical questions. The weight of regret is different for different 
people. Some find they can reclaim time with kids later; others feel like early 
childhood is irreplaceable.

What's your gut saying?
```

**Characteristics**:
- Personal, intuitive, exploratory
- Asks clarifying questions
- Builds rapport
- No structured analysis
- Fast and warm

---

### WAR MODE Response

```
[MODE] Switched to WAR
[MODE] Ministers: risk, power, grand_strategist, technology, timing

N: [WAR] Strategy Council convenes. Here's the aggressive-but-smart analysis:

COUNCIL CONSENSUS: ACCEPT WITH NEGOTIATION

Why: This is a timing window. VP Sales is a power position that locks in your 
trajectory. Declining signals someone else gets it—that's a power loss that's 
hard to recover from.

Winning Move: Counter-offer before accepting:
1. Negotiate 40-hour commitment with travel flexibility 
   (Risk: they say no. But you only asked, not burned bridge)
2. Secure executive flexibility on school runs, vacations 
   (This is standard for C-level. They grant it.)
3. Timeline: Start in Q2 (gives you summer with kids before ramping)

SHORT-TERM WIN: You get power position + keep partial time with kids
LONG-TERM: Kids see ambitious parent. You model how to win without sacrificing core values.

RISK CHECK: Only risk is they rescind offer. But you're already employed. Low downside.

Next move: Email them back. "Love the opportunity. Before I accept, 3 items to 
discuss that will make me most effective..."
```

**Characteristics**:
- Frames as "winning move"
- Aggressive but smart negotiation
- Short-term advantage focused
- Risk mitigation included (still present)
- Action-oriented

---

### MEETING MODE Response

```
[MODE] Already in MEETING MODE (default)

N: [MEETING] Council convenes: Grand Strategist, Psychology, Timing, Risk, Diplomacy

GRAND STRATEGIST: "VP position is critical for long-term career. You have limited 
windows to make this jump. In 10 years, you'll wish you'd taken it."

PSYCHOLOGY: "But forced choice between ambition and parenthood is false. Kids need 
present parents. Burnout serves neither ambition nor family. Middle path exists."

TIMING: "The window is open now. Waiting 2 years means competing with 10 others for 
next opening. But also: kids are young for only a few years. Both windows are real."

RISK: "Burnout is the real risk. 60-hour weeks might become 70, then 80. Then you're 
absent AND ineffective. That's the trap to watch."

DIPLOMACY: "Before deciding, have a real conversation with the hiring executive. 
'I'm excited AND concerned about hours. What flexibility exists for family time?' 
Their answer tells you everything."

SYNTHESIS: 
The key isn't accepting or declining. It's negotiating. Don't accept the 60-hour frame.

Test their flexibility first. If they grant 45 hours + schedule flexibility, you win.
If they won't budge, you learn this company won't support what you need—also valuable.

Don't decide until you've had that conversation.
```

**Characteristics**:
- Multiple perspectives shown
- Disagreements surfaced (Strategist vs Psychology)
- Identifies false dichotomy
- Balanced tradeoff analysis
- Consensus on next step (negotiate first)
- Thoughtful, measured

---

### DARBAR MODE Response

```
[MODE] Switched to DARBAR
[MODE] All 18 ministers convene

N: [DARBAR] This is a values decision. The council goes deep.

GRAND STRATEGIST: "Career trajectory matters. This is a power position. Declining 
might mean permanent ceiling."

POWER: "But power at what cost? Exhausted executives make poor decisions. Real power 
includes control over your own time."

PSYCHOLOGY: "This is a parenting decision disguised as a career decision. What do 
you want your kids to remember about your presence? That matters."

TRUTH: "Let's be honest: You're hoping to have it both ways—the promotion AND the 
time. That's usually a false fantasy with 60-hour weeks. Someone loses."

LEGITIMACY: "The company has a right to ask for commitment. You have a right to 
your family time. Both are legitimate."

DISCIPLINE: "Don't decide this in a vacuum. Set actual hours, actual commitments, 
actual boundaries. Test what 'VP hours' really means at THIS company."

RESOURCES: "What are your financial needs? If you're financially secure, declining 
makes more sense. If you need the income for kids' futures, different calculation."

OPTIONALITY: "Can you negotiate a trial period? 6 months of VP hours, then assess? 
That removes false finality."

SOVEREIGNTY: "But ultimately, this is YOUR decision. Not your kids' decision, not 
your career advisor's, not the company's. What do you deeply believe is right?"

---

RED LINE CHECK: Does this role require compromising fundamental values?
- NOT compromising legitimacy (no fraud/illegal acts)
- NOT compromising truth (no deception)
- Not creating existential family harm (kids have other parent? Support systems?)

If these are clear, the decision is workable with negotiation.

---

DEEP SYNTHESIS:

The real question isn't "promotion or family." It's "What kind of parent and 
professional do I want to be? And what does this company need me to be?"

Those answers might align (with negotiation) or they might not. But you need to know 
the truth before deciding.

ACTION STEPS:
1. Have an honest conversation with your manager about hours/flexibility
2. Talk to current VP or other execs about REAL hours (not job description hours)
3. Imagine yourself in role for 3 years. Does that version of you feel whole?
4. If yes with negotiation: negotiate hard. If no: decline and feel peace about it.

The decision itself matters less than knowing you decided authentically.
```

**Characteristics**:
- All perspectives visible
- Red lines explicitly checked
- Deep personal reflection provoked
- Identifies hidden assumptions (false dichotomy)
- Respects user's sovereignty
- Wisdom and nuance
- Longer, deeper

---

## Example 2: Competitive Business Decision

**User Question**: "Our main competitor just launched a feature we're planning in 6 months. They're marketing it aggressively. Should we accelerate our launch (risky timing) or stick to our plan (risk losing market share)?"

---

### QUICK MODE Response

```
N: [QUICK] Ouch, tough timing. That's stressful.

Here's my quick gut: Their launch might be better or worse than it looks. What 
do customers actually think of it? Have you gotten feedback yet?

Because if their version has issues, rushing to copy them fast might look panicked. 
But if it's genuinely great, being second is genuinely bad for positioning.

What's your read on the quality of their version? And how much of your current 
timeline is solid vs padding?
```

**Characteristics**:
- Empathetic and warm
- Asks clarifying questions
- No council deliberation
- Fast and personal
- Helps user think clearly

---

### WAR MODE Response

```
[MODE] Switched to WAR
[MODE] Ministers: risk, power, grand_strategist, technology, timing

N: [WAR] Competition Council convenes. CLEAR CONSENSUS: ACCELERATE (with conditions)

WHY: Market perception is everything. Being second to "innovate" is a positioning loss. 
If their feature sticks, you're now the follower. That's a power shift you can't 
undo later.

WINNING MOVE:

1. ASSESS THEIR WEAKNESS (next 72 hours)
   - Can you improve their version quickly?
   - What did they miss or compromise?
   - Is their marketing outpacing reality?

2. ACCELERATE SMART (6 months → 3 months)
   - Cut non-essential features (ship 80% done, not 100%)
   - Position as "improved version of their concept"
   - Marketing: "We heard customers wanted X. Here it is, better."

3. TIMING: Launch within 8 weeks
   - Too fast = looks rushed
   - 8 weeks = responsive + thoughtful

4. RISK MITIGATION:
   - Technical debt acceptable (you'll patch later)
   - Quality bar: No game-breaking bugs
   - If you can't hit 8 weeks, don't rush. Stick to plan.

RED LINE: Don't ship crap. Bad launch is worse than being second.

POWER POSITION: You'll own "improved version of this feature" - that's the narrative 
that wins market share.
```

**Characteristics**:
- Action-focused
- Aggressive timeline (6 months → 3 months)
- Winning narrative emphasized
- Clear next steps
- Risk still present (not reckless)
- Competitive advantage clear

---

### MEETING MODE Response

```
[MODE] In MEETING MODE (default)

N: [MEETING] Council convenes: Technology, Grand Strategist, Risk, Timing, Data

TECHNOLOGY: "We can accelerate if we cut scope. What's truly essential vs nice-to-have?"

GRAND STRATEGIST: "Being second isn't death. Being obviously rushed is. The narrative 
matters—why we accelerated and what we delivered."

RISK: "Accelerating 3 months increases technical debt and bug risk. You need to know 
your team's actual capacity. Asking for impossible is self-sabotage."

TIMING: "They got initial buzz, but buzz fades. If we launch in 12 weeks with a 
better product, we still win. If we launch in 12 weeks with buggy product, we lose."

DATA: "Before deciding, what's the actual customer impact of their feature? Is it 
game-changing or incremental?"

---

DEBATE HIGHLIGHTS:
- All agree on not shipping broken
- Disagree on timeline (8 weeks vs 14 weeks)
- Agreement that quality > speed
- Agreement that narrative > features

CONSENSUS: 
Accelerate IF you can hit 12 weeks with solid quality and a clear story. 
If 12 weeks means cutting important work or sacrificing quality, the answer is "no."

NEXT STEPS:
1. Honest assessment: Can team deliver quality in 12 weeks?
2. If yes: Accelerate with narrative "We listened to feedback and built better"
3. If no: Stay on plan and launch as "market-validated upgrade"

The timeline isn't the decision. Team capacity is.
```

**Characteristics**:
- Multiple viewpoints shown
- Technical constraints considered
- Quality protected
- 12 weeks (compromise between 8 and 24)
- Conditional acceleration (if team can handle it)
- Realistic assessment valued

### DARBAR MODE Response

```
[MODE] Switched to DARBAR
[MODE] All 18 ministers convene

N: [DARBAR] This is a strategic inflection point. Deep council convenes.

POWER: "They moved first. That's a power advantage. Responding means accepting 
follower position briefly. Important to acknowledge."

GRAND STRATEGIST: "But market share isn't determined by who's first. It's determined 
by network effects, retention, and brand. What do they have?"

TECHNOLOGY: "Their feature is a point. Sustainable advantage comes from integration, 
ecosystem, ease of use. Can we build that better?"

DISCIPLINE: "Don't be driven by fear. Competitor-reactive strategy is rarely optimal 
strategy. Stick to your roadmap unless something fundamental changed."

TRUTH: "Why did they launch first? Better execution? Different priorities? 
Understanding WHY matters before copying them."

RESOURCES: "What would accelerating actually cost in human effort and opportunity 
cost elsewhere?"

DATA: "Measure impact. Is their customer adoption 5%? 50%? Customer reaction tells 
the real story, not your anxiety."

CONFLICT: "There's tension between 'don't be reactive' and 'don't ignore market 
shifts.' Both are true. Which applies here?"

NARRATIVE: "How do you want your company known? As the follower who copies fast? 
Or as the leader who ships integrated solutions? That's a brand question."

---

SOVEREIGNTY: "The real question for YOUR company: Is this a threat to your long-term 
strategy, or a small battle in a bigger game?"

---

SYNTHESIS:

1. DIAGNOSE (don't assume): What's the actual market impact?
2. CALIBRATE: Is this marginal or existential threat?
3. DECIDE: Based on truth, not fear
4. EXECUTE: Move decisively once decided

If marginal: Stay on plan, launch when ready, own integration story
If existential: Accelerate, but protect quality and team

The worst outcome: Rush, miss target, AND lose narrative.

DECISION FRAMEWORK:
- If competitor feature is truly game-changing AND you can deliver in 12 weeks 
  with quality: Accelerate
- If competitor feature is marginal OR you can't deliver quality quickly: Stick to plan
- If you're unsure: Buy information first. Talk to 20 customers. That costs 2 weeks 
  and tells you everything.
```

**Characteristics**:
- Deep strategic thinking
- Threat assessment honest (power loss acknowledged)
- But questions the premise
- Moves decision on data, not fear
- Respects organizational integrity
- Longer deliberation

---

## Example 3: Personal Health/Wellness Decision

**User Question**: "I've been struggling with energy and focus. Doctor says it might be thyroid or just stress. Tests would take 2 weeks. Should I start a special diet + supplements now (might help, might not) or wait for test results?"

---

### QUICK MODE Response

```
N: [QUICK] This is frustrating—wanting answers before you have them.

My honest take: Energy problems are weird in that sometimes fixing one small 
thing helps everything. But sometimes the small fix doesn't help and you feel 
like you wasted effort.

What's your intuition? Does your energy feel like "tired because I'm anxious" 
or "tired because something's physically off"? That's not medical, but it might 
point you.

And practically: What would it cost to try diet + supplements for 2 weeks?
```

**Characteristics**:
- Validating (acknowledges frustration)
- Personal and intuitive
- Helps user trust their own intuition
- No structured analysis
- Warm and exploratory

---

### WAR MODE Response

```
[MODE] Switched to WAR
[MODE] Ministers: risk, timing, power, data, technology

N: [WAR] Health Council convenes. CONSENSUS: START NOW (smart version)

LOGIC: You're losing 2 weeks of potential energy/productivity. In competitive 
personal performance, 2 weeks @ 60% energy is a real cost.

WINNING APPROACH:
1. Start scientifically: Diet + supplements designed for thyroid support
   (B vitamins, iron, iodine—safe, evidence-based)
2. Don't change everything (can't tell what helps vs hurts)
3. Track: Sleep, energy, focus daily
4. When results come back: You have data to compare against

WIN: If it helps, you're 2 weeks ahead. If it doesn't, you have baseline for 
what test results mean.

TIMING: Start tomorrow. You've already decided (you're asking when, not if)

RISK: Small (these are safe supplements) and worth the upside.

Execution: Hit the pharmacy today. Get started tomorrow.
```

**Characteristics**:
- Action-oriented
- Time viewed as valuable resource
- Optimization focus
- Data gathering (daily tracking)
- Risk minimal but considered
- Quick execution

---

### MEETING MODE Response

```
[MODE] In MEETING MODE (default)

N: [MEETING] Council convenes: Risk, Data, Timing, Psychology, Discipline

RISK: "Supplements are generally safe, but some interact with medications. 
What are you currently taking? That's first question."

DATA: "What does research say about [specific diet] + [specific supplements] 
for energy? More important than generic 'health' claims."

PSYCHOLOGY: "Placebo effect is real, but lasting energy improvement isn't placebo. 
If you start something, don't assume help after 3 days—wait 2 weeks for honest signal."

TIMING: "Test results come in 2 weeks. That's not long to wait. But 2 weeks of 
better energy is valuable too."

DISCIPLINE: "If you start supplements, only change ONE major thing (diet OR 
supplements, not both). Otherwise you won't know what helped."

---

DEBATE:
- Risk wants to wait for medical clearance
- Timing wants to start now (win the week)
- Data says track carefully if you start

CONSENSUS: 
Start diet changes (safe, scientifically supported)
Defer supplements until after test results clarify what you actually need

This gets you: 80% of "doing something" without blind supplementation

NEXT STEPS:
1. Confirm with doctor: "Is starting [specific diet] safe with my current situation?"
2. If yes: Start diet now, full tracking
3. Get test results: Adjust supplements based on results
4. Reassess after 6 weeks of combined intervention
```

**Characteristics**:
- Asks clarifying medical questions
- Data-driven approach
- Compromise that balances action and wisdom
- Tracking emphasized
- Medical provider consultation required
- Conservative but not paralyzed

---

### DARBAR MODE Response

```
[MODE] Switched to DARBAR
[MODE] All 18 ministers convene

N: [DARBAR] This is a decision point about your body's signals. The council 
goes deep on meaning, not just tactics.

RISK: "Before any intervention, what does medical science actually say? Generic 
'thyroid support' isn't a diagnosis. We need specifics."

TRUTH: "Your body is telling you something. The question is: Urgent signal or 
normal variation? Tests answer that. Supplements are guessing."

DISCIPLINE: "Don't pathologize normal variation. But also don't ignore genuine 
signals. Where's the honest middle?"

PSYCHOLOGY: "Energy is influenced by stress, sleep quality, meaning, social 
connection—not just thyroid. Supplements can't fix those."

TIMING: "2 weeks is very short. But if you're dramatically fatigued, 2 weeks 
is valuable time. Context matters."

RESOURCES: "What's the cost of 2 weeks at low energy vs cost of testing + 
targeted intervention?"

DATA: "Reviews of 'energy supplement' studies show: Placebo effect strong, 
actual effect modest, highly individual variation."

ADAPTATION: "Consider: While waiting for tests, improve what you CAN control 
immediately—sleep, water, movement, stress reduction."

LEGITIMACY: "Medical guidelines: Supplements only after diagnosis (except standard 
multivitamins). Respect that framework or understand why you're departing from it."

NARRATIVE: "How you think about this matters. 'I'm broken and need to fix it 
NOW' vs 'My body's signaling something; let me listen and respond thoughtfully' 
are different stories."

---

SYNTHESIS:

Energy loss is attention from your body. Before supplementing, listen.

DO NOW (safe, evidence-based):
- Improve sleep: Consistent bedtime, dark room, no screens 1 hour before
- Optimize water: 8 glasses daily
- Check stress: Are you running on fumes emotionally?
- Track quality: Daily 1-10 for energy, mood, focus, sleep

WAIT (until test results):
- Thyroid-specific supplements (if thyroid is the issue, then yes; if not, pointless)
- Major diet overhauls (stress+ dietary changes = too many variables)

GET RESULTS (then decide):
- If thyroid is normal: Likely stress/sleep issue. Different intervention.
- If thyroid is low: Medication + supplements makes sense.
- If thyroid is high: Supplements are wrong approach.

The test results take 2 weeks. In those 2 weeks, listen to your body. 
That listening IS the intervention.
```

**Characteristics**:
- Distinguishes between signal and noise
- Emphasis on listening vs. fixing
- Safe interventions (sleep, water, stress) prioritized
- Medical science respected
- Holistic perspective (stress, sleep, meaning)
- Wisdom about what drives energy
- Deeper philosophical approach

---

## Key Insight: Same Question, Different Wisdom

Notice how each mode produces DIFFERENT but VALID advice:

- **QUICK**: "Trust your intuition, explore"
- **WAR**: "Move now, gather data in parallel, own the timeline"
- **MEETING**: "Compromise: diet now, supplements later, track carefully"
- **DARBAR**: "Listen to your body's signal first; tests matter; sleep/stress matter"

**Which is right?** 
- If you're anxious and need emotional reassurance: **QUICK**
- If you want to maximize productivity in 2 weeks: **WAR**
- If you want balanced, realistic approach: **MEETING**
- If you want deep wisdom respecting your body: **DARBAR**

All are valid. All are useful. The MODE you choose changes the FRAME, not whether 
it's good advice.

---

## How to Use These Examples

1. **See a mode difference**: Pick any decision in your life
2. **Ask yourself each mode's question**:
   - Quick: "What's my gut telling me?"
   - War: "How do I win this?"
   - Meeting: "What's the balanced approach?"
   - Darbar: "What's the deep wisdom here?"
3. **Notice how different frames illuminate different aspects**
4. **Use the mode that fits your current need**

Over time, you'll develop intuition for which mode serves you best for different 
decision types.
