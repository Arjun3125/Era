🔒 INTERNAL DECISION: CONDITIONAL ACCEPTANCE

Project: Era / Ministerial Cognitive Architecture
Status: Revise & Resubmit (R&R)
Track: Cognitive Governance & Structured Deliberation
Resubmission Window: 6–9 months

Executive Summary

Era demonstrates:

Structured multi-perspective reasoning

Clear separation of governance layers

Outcome-linked adaptation loop

Interpretability uncommon in modern AI systems

However, it currently lacks:

Formal evaluation methodology

Learned routing and aggregation

Statistical calibration

Robust adversarial validation

Approval is contingent on completing the following milestones.

🔵 MILESTONE 1 — Formal Evaluation Framework

Priority: Critical
Time Horizon: 6–8 weeks

Problem

Current performance claims (e.g., 45% → 82%) lack:

Defined benchmark set

Blind evaluation

Statistical confidence intervals

Ablation controls

This prevents scientific validation.

Required Deliverables
1.1 Benchmark Suite (Minimum 100 Scenarios)

Construct:

25 irreversible decision cases

25 high-emotional-load cases

25 strategic competition cases

25 long-horizon tradeoff cases

Each must include:

Ground-truth rubric

Multiple valid solution paths

Outcome scoring schema

Regret scoring rubric

Freeze the dataset.

No post-hoc modification.

1.2 Statistical Evaluation Protocol

For each release:

5 random seeds

95% confidence intervals

Baseline comparison (LLM-only, no council)

Paired t-test or bootstrap significance

Report:

Mean success rate

Variance

Effect size

Calibration curve

No claims without statistical backing.

1.3 Ablation Study Matrix

Run controlled experiments removing:

Ministers

KIS weighting

ML prior

PWM memory

Mode escalation

Quantify delta performance.

Interpretability without ablation is narrative, not science.

🔵 MILESTONE 2 — Replace Heuristic Learning with Parametric Learning

Priority: Critical
Time Horizon: 8–12 weeks

Problem

Current learning:

Outcome → rule-based weight adjustment

This is heuristic reward shaping, not learning.

Required Upgrades
2.1 Learnable Minister Weighting

Replace fixed aggregation logic with:

Learned minister gating network

Context-conditioned expert weighting

Trainable softmax routing

Inputs:

Feature vector (41-dim)

Disagreement entropy

Irreversibility score

Output:

Minister weight distribution

Ministers remain interpretable, but influence becomes data-driven.

2.2 Replace KIS Multiplicative Formula

Current:

domain × type × memory × context × goal


Upgrade to:

Embedding-based retrieval

Learned re-ranking head

Trainable weight interaction

Goal:
Retain interpretability, eliminate hard-coded bounds.

2.3 Value Model for Decision Quality

Train:

A scalar value head predicting expected success

Calibrated to regret-adjusted reward

Use this to:

Gate council recommendations

Trigger mode escalation

Flag high-risk outputs

🔵 MILESTONE 3 — Confidence Calibration & Uncertainty Modeling

Priority: High
Time Horizon: 6 weeks

Problem

Confidence values are symbolic, not calibrated.

Required Deliverables
3.1 Reliability Diagrams

For 1000+ decisions:

Plot predicted confidence vs empirical success

Compute Brier score

Measure overconfidence bias

Target:
< 5% miscalibration error.

3.2 Disagreement-Aware Uncertainty

Compute:

Minister vote entropy

KIS variance

ML prior variance

Use combined uncertainty score to:

Trigger DARBAR automatically

Issue caution flags

Increase deliberation depth

🔵 MILESTONE 4 — Adversarial & Stress Evaluation

Priority: High
Time Horizon: 8 weeks

Problem

Synthetic human simulation is cooperative, not adversarial.

Required Enhancements
4.1 Adversarial User Simulator

Train a synthetic user to:

Maximize regret

Induce contradiction

Exploit blind spots

Use self-play loops.

Measure system degradation.

4.2 Distribution Shift Testing

Test on:

Out-of-domain cases

Extreme time pressure

Conflicting value systems

Sparse-information decisions

Report performance delta.

4.3 Red-Team Governance Testing

Attempt to break:

Red-line enforcement

Identity consistency

Mode isolation

Ministerial coherence

Track failure frequency.

🔵 MILESTONE 5 — Automatic Mode Escalation

Priority: Medium
Time Horizon: 4 weeks

Replace manual mode selection with learned escalation.

Escalation triggers should include:

High irreversibility score

High disagreement entropy

Low value-model confidence

High regret prediction

Compute-budget optimization must be measurable.

🔵 MILESTONE 6 — Formal Research Framing

Era must transition from “system” to “research contribution.”

Draft paper structure:

Problem: Lack of interpretable governance layers in LLM systems

Approach: Modular ministerial architecture

Learning upgrade: Parametric routing + calibrated uncertainty

Evaluation: 100+ benchmark scenarios

Ablation results

Failure analysis

Governance implications

Without formal framing, this remains engineering.

Acceptance Criteria for Resubmission

The project will be reconsidered if:

Performance improvement survives ablation

Confidence is statistically calibrated

Minister weighting is learned

Escalation is automatic

Adversarial degradation <20%

Benchmark results reproducible across seeds

If met:

Project moves to exploratory collaboration track.

If not:

Project remains engineering prototype, not research-grade.

Strategic Advisory

Do not attempt to:

Increase conceptual complexity

Add more ministers

Add more modes

Add more symbolic heuristics

The path forward is:

Fewer heuristics.
More learning.
More measurement.
More uncertainty modeling.

Final Institutional Comment

Era’s strongest property is interpretability.

Do not sacrifice it.

Convert heuristics into learnable parameters while preserving structural transparency.

That is the research edge.
